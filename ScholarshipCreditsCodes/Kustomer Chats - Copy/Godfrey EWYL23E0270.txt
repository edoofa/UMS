13/07/23, 22:40 - Godfrey EWYL23E0270: I learned a lot from this amazing man Sundar Pichai.From the story l came to know that the challenge is a chance to do our best in life .ln order to achieve better goals in life we have to be out of comfort zone(desperate zone calls for desperate action)just like Sundar Pichai ,his troubles of lack of resources did not stop him to become a role model of us as students today.

The other thing is to persue passion and purpose.this help us as students to be focused on our plans and our goals and if we do so ,no effort is wasted.Like Sundar Pichai had his passion for technology and this guided him to be successful in life.

I learned to be innovative and to embrace change ,to identify emerging trends this can be more instrumental on our future work places and even our own businesses,As students we have to be open to change and develop a mindset of continuous improvement

Last but not least,we have to have good leadership qualities and to have a vision as well.Most of us students are working blindly towards their goals in life and we end up doing things we are not worth for .

20/07/23, 15:20 - Godfrey EWYL23E0270: Thank you mentor for sharing this wonderful Wednesday wisdom ,l genuinely enjoyed reading and l grasp some key skills of life as a student.

1.As a student l must lead by example.It is exactly yesterday when l was telling my fellow students about action during our school devotion. long back l told them about the art of following through and after that l had to do it first so that they would see the meaning of it in their academics.So ,yesterday it became very easy for them to listen me when l was telling them about the significance of taking action in their academics so that they can enjoy the fruits of it in their future.

2.Build relationships, it is very important to maintain good relations with those who are surround us. This can help to solve conficts during our student life and will also be helpful in our future workplaces ith our managers.
3. We have to communicate effectively,this skill is very crutial in every part we can think of because it  motivate others. communication must be two way to be effective and this helps us to listen to each other's opinions and to have feedback as well.

4. True leadership is about to empower others to reach their full potential,to encourage them ,and offer mentorship to them and assistance whenever possible.This is all about leadership where they creat fans and friends who are motivated individuals

Embrace learning like Rahul, a poor but determined boy. Passing a library every day, he couldn't resist its allure. With borrowed books, he studied relentlessly, earning a scholarship to a prestigious school. Hard work won him a scholarship to a renowned university. But Rahul's journey didn't end there. He built libraries in his village, offering free education to underprivileged children. Let his story inspire you to never stop pursuing knowledge. Education is a powerful tool to transform your life and help others. Believe in yourself, embrace every opportunity to learn, and make today a day of growth.
