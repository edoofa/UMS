‚Äã‚Äã
‚ÄãThis is where we will be having our sessions from now on.‚Äã
26/04/23, 13:54 - Aditi Kapoor: Since, It is Wednesday Today, Therefore, I am sharing the Wednesday Lesson below with you
26/04/23, 13:54 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.


Last week we learnt about first 6 principles from the book- Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. Today‚Äôs Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the remaining principles. Ready to learn in detail?

The book outlines specific principles and strategies that successful people have used to achieve their goals. By following these principles, readers can create a roadmap for their own success. I believe, reading "Think and Grow Rich" can provide readers with the mindset, motivation, and strategies needed to achieve success in any area of life. Let us discuss in detail about your learnings in our upcoming scheduled session.


Happy Learning

Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Here we are with our weekend activity, it has been some time that we are talking about leadership, styles of leadership and have even learnt alot for our leader from Edoofa. It goes without saying that leadership is a skill that one acquires over time and with continous effort to acquire this characteristic.The EWYL programme, each project and task that is assigned to you, is a direct place for you to practise this skill. This weekend, sit with yourself and write about how you can use the EWYL programme to master the skill of leadership, and make a plan for which projects you will prioritise to be a leader in the student community. How will you ensure that your name is on the next list of student leaders for the Edoofa student community? Some of the students have already been recommended as Student Leaders by the mentors; how will you ensure that your name is on the next list of student leaders for the Edoofa student community?

Since a detailed plan is required, so the minimum word limit of today‚Äôs activity is 150 words.
The last day to submit your responses is Monday and don‚Äôt forget only the responses shared on dedicated EWYL line will be evaluated.
21/05/23, 15:32 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1288: Okay Sir
