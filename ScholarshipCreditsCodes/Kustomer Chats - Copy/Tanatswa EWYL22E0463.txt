North Star Metric is a key business metric that reflects the core value a product delivers to its customers. It's a single, actionable metric that aligns all efforts towards achieving long-term growth. Let us learn about in greater detail, read the lesson carefully and we will connect in our upcoming scheduled session.

business's overall success. It also guides in decision-making and
prioritization.NSM should be relevant and in accordance in what the company is about, what is it's purpose and why we need it. 
For Facebook, the NSM is\"Daily Active Users\"(DAU) .
 NSM helps business to have a clearer motive of what really matters. It removes distractions and unites a business towards the common goal.

11/03/23, 18:42 - Tenzin: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well

The feedback we have received from some of you on this week’s Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.
As part of this week’s Saturday Activity, you are required to share your written submission on : 
What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?
There is no word limit, so feel free to express your understanding in detail. The second answer requires some mental work, so sit with yourself, introspect, and share your honest answer with your mentor. 
Let this activity play an important role in your personal goal setting. We will connect soon in our upcoming session. 
Till then, happy learning and happy growing!","transform":"
11/03/23, 22:05 - Tenzin: Well Done Tanatswa!
11/03/23, 22:06 - Tenzin: Did you know the NSM of The Edoofa Program is the EWYL?
12/03/23, 05:20 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0463: Yes. I read
12/03/23, 07:20 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0463: A North Star Metric helps a business manage it's operating procedures. It guides what the business stands for and it's ideal purpose. It unites all participants with the goal clearly outlined and removes distractions that may cause the business to deviate from the main purpose hence the word focus is clearly defined.
12/03/23, 08:32 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0463: As a student, a North Star Metric would be a great starting point to success and excellence. As a high school student, there are many distractions  that might deviate our focus from education but I personally believe when one chooses to focus on a goal everything else should be blurred. The goal of my life is to pass my A level and work well with the Edoofa team so as to attain a higher tertiary education and do mechatronics a course that I desire. Focusing on this goal requires one to have a   vibrant academic, social, physical and spiritual lifestyle; I believe that is what North Star Metric is all about; being able to define your goal and how to achieve it. A dream with action is a goal and a dream without action is a wish. I believe that knowing where you have started, where you are and where you want to be is what makes true goals stand.

20/03/23, 17:42 - Tenzin: Hello my proud Edoofian!

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!","transform":"
