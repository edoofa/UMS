Team EWYL
23/09/23, 13:27 - Shalom EWYL23E0026: Advantageous of freelancing for graphic design, programming prowess and excellent writing skills

Freelancing allows a student with more flexibility and control over schedule and workload. Student can choose when and how much she can work which can be a huge advantage for those who need to balance work with other commitments. A student can also choose type of project to take on allowing her to focus on those that excite and interest. Freelancing can offer the potential for higher pay than traditional graphic design jobs, since a student can set her own rate and negotiate with client directly.

A student can be her own boss and work on projects that find interesting and rewarding. This can lead to a greater sense of fulfilment and satisfaction in her work. A student can also work remotely, which can save time and money on commuting and allow to work from anywhere in the work.

Freelancing offers flexibility, writers who freelance can choose when and where they work. This flexibility allows writers who freelance to command higher rates for their work than those who are employed  full time by a single company. This is because they can negotiate directly with clients and often have more control over their pricing.

By effectively managing her time, she can avoid feeling overwhelmed and reduce stress levels, leading to improved mental well-being.

With proper time management, a person have the opportunity to reflect on her priorities and make informed decisions. By evaluating the importance and urgency of each task, she can allocate her time and resources accordingly, making better choices and achieving better results.

29/09/23, 14:36 - Shalom EWYL23E0026: Explore strategies to make the most of study time:

1. Plan and prioritize: Create a study schedule outlining the tasks or subjects need to be covered. Prioritize the most important or challenging topics and allocate appropriate time for each.

2. Remove distractions: Minimize distractions such as email notifications, social media, and phone calls. Find a quiet and comfortable study environment to help maintain focus.

3. Break it down: 
If you have a large task or subject to tackle, break it down into smaller, manageable subtasks or topics. This can help to avoid feeling overwhelmed and make studying more achievable.

4. Take regular breaks: While studying for extended periods may seem productive, it can actually decrease focus and retention. Take short breaks every 25-30 minutes to rest, recharge, and avoid burnout. Use this time to stretch, take a walk, or do something enjoyable for refreshing mind.

5. Practice time blocking:
 Allocate specific blocks of time to study specific subjects or tasks. This helps to create a structured study routine and avoids multitasking.

6. Take care of yourself:
Ensure you are getting enough sleep, eating well and engaging in physical activity.

7. Stay motivated:
Set specific goals and reward yourself when you archive them. Find ways to make studying enjoyable.
