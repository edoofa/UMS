​Let start our day with this beautiful quote  you believe it’ll work out, you’ll see opportunities. If you don’t believe it’ll work out, you’ll see obstacles.” – Wayne Dyer*
15/07/22, 23:40 - Brandon EWYL21E0832: Afternoon ma'am how  are you this afternoon
16/07/22, 00:02 - Unknown: Brandon, I am very well.
Thanks for asking.
16/07/22, 00:02 - Unknown: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e, you will be having 2 sessions on selected days. On Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
Sounds interesting, right?
18/07/22, 03:15 - Brandon EWYL21E0832: Yes ma'am very interesting
18/07/22, 23:27 - Brandon EWYL21E0832: Afternoon ma'am how are you
18/07/22, 23:28 - Brandon EWYL21E0832: Did you communicate with the superiors about my request
19/07/22, 03:32 - Brandon EWYL21E0832: I'm here to hear the pending story ma'am
19/07/22, 18:01 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
Hope you are doing well, 

*We need to accept that we won’t always make the right decisions, that we’ll screw up royally sometimes―understanding that failure is not the opposite of success, it’s part of success*
19/07/22, 18:07 - Unknown: I communicated with the admissions team , they said they will look into it but you have to text on your admissions group for the same.
19/07/22, 18:07 - Unknown: Just send the same text about extending your period on your admissions group.
25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

02/08/22, 02:58 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

07/08/22, 04:41 - Unknown: Okay Brandon , 
I did not ignore you and we all are here for you but we were all really occupied arranging the content and PPT for the webinar that is why I could not respond back timely. I hope you understand the thin line between ignoring and scheduling things to be done later.

Also, I am apologetic in case you felt that and I will keep that in mind but there are too many scheduled events and chores that we need to carry on. I have always been available for you and further also will be considerate.
