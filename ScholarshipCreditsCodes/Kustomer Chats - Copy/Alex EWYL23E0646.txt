04/10/23, 17:49 - Alex EWYL23E0646: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Alex Mafindi and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Alex EWYL23E0646
05/10/23, 12:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Alex!
How are you doing?
05/10/23, 12:20 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
05/10/23, 12:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - “I am a proud Edoofian”
05/10/23, 12:21 - Saloni Rastogi: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter

3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
05/10/23, 12:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *12:00-01:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
05/10/23, 12:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
05/10/23, 12:25 - Alex EWYL23E0646: Yes maam
05/10/23, 12:26 - Alex EWYL23E0646: Yes maam l understand
05/10/23, 12:27 - Alex EWYL23E0646: Yes maam
05/10/23, 13:02 - Saloni Rastogi: That is great, so let's meet in our session at the scheduled time!
05/10/23, 15:40 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, Alex, may I know which project would you like to give all your attention for this month?
05/10/23, 16:28 - Alex EWYL23E0646: Good afternoon ma'am
05/10/23, 16:30 - Alex EWYL23E0646: Project number 1
05/10/23, 16:32 - Saloni Rastogi: For some time, Project One has been on hold for some time due to some development, we can proceed with project two and project three.
05/10/23, 16:33 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know what is your understanding of project 2 and project three?
05/10/23, 16:35 - Alex EWYL23E0646: Project 3
05/10/23, 16:36 - Alex EWYL23E0646: Project 2

Community building, reaching out to othet African students who are interested in studying abroad.
05/10/23, 16:37 - Alex EWYL23E0646: Project 3

Contacting and arranging for meetings with the principals from secondary schools
05/10/23, 16:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, that is absolutely correct!
05/10/23, 16:40 - Alex EWYL23E0646: Yes maam
05/10/23, 16:42 - Saloni Rastogi: First, let me talk about community building.
05/10/23, 16:42 - Saloni Rastogi: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
05/10/23, 16:42 - Alex EWYL23E0646: Yes maam
05/10/23, 16:43 - Saloni Rastogi: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*

For eg: In your case, it will be-

*Alex/Saloni/5OCT2023*
05/10/23, 16:43 - Saloni Rastogi: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
05/10/23, 16:43 - Saloni Rastogi: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
05/10/23, 16:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
05/10/23, 16:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
05/10/23, 16:45 - Alex EWYL23E0646: Understood
05/10/23, 16:53 - Saloni Rastogi: So for today, the target is to form these WhatsApp group.
Our target is to add more and more students in the group.
05/10/23, 16:53 - Saloni Rastogi: So for community building:
1) Keep the group updated DAILY.
2) Try reaching out to students from different schools
3) Try reaching out to teachers from your school or others and ask them to share the link to your WhatsApp group with other school teachers from different schools
4) In the group just:
-please give 'only admins' access
-just ask the students/participants to DM you to know about Edoofa and to get the form
-once they DM you, share about Edoofa with them
-Before sharing the form, ask them to get you added to their school groups
-once they do that, then only share the form with them.​
​5) Use social media as your sword to tell people about Edoofa
6) Use Facebook groups, I am sharing a screenshot that will help you understand that there are various groups on Facebook that you can join and share information about Edoofa also forward the link to your WhatsApp group there.
05/10/23, 16:54 - Alex EWYL23E0646: Yes maam

05/10/23, 16:55 - Saloni Rastogi: .
05/10/23, 16:56 - Alex EWYL23E0646: Should I add you to the group
05/10/23, 16:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes add me in the group too so that I can track your progress.
05/10/23, 16:57 - Saloni Rastogi: There is a trick on how you can excel and increase the number of participants in the group:

1. Give only admin access in the group and share messages in the group that can direct them towards your inbox where you can share the information about Edoofa.
Similar to the screenshot that I am sharing with you.
05/10/23, 16:57 - Saloni Rastogi: .
05/10/23, 16:57 - Alex EWYL23E0646: Yes maam
05/10/23, 16:58 - Saloni Rastogi: 2. Once they come to your INBOX, share information about Edoofa with them except for the application form.

3. Afterwards, if they ask for the application form, ask them to share the link of your WhatsApp group with 10 other groups and them share a screenshot with you once they have done that.

4. After they have done it, share the application form with them.
05/10/23, 16:59 - Alex EWYL23E0646: Yes maam

I hope this message finds you well. Today's "Wednesday Wisdom" session will delve into the topic of peak performance and the significance of focus in achieving success. We've all heard experts advise us to concentrate, eliminate distractions, and commit to mastering one thing. This guidance is undoubtedly valuable, and the more I study successful individuals from various fields—be it artists, athletes, entrepreneurs, or scientists—the more I am convinced that focus plays a pivotal role in their accomplishments.

Together, we'll explore strategies and ideas that can help you navigate the complex landscape of choices and find your true calling.
Read the PDF very carefully and we will connect in our upcoming session.

Till Then
Happy Learning!
