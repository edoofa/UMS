16/03/23, 04:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian,
This week's Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the topic of \"Seeking Wealth, not Money or Status.\" This is an important lesson that will provide valuable insights into the pursuit of financial stability and success. During this lesson, we will explore the concept of wealth and its importance in building a sustainable financial future. We will discuss the difference between wealth, money, and status, and how each of these concepts plays a role in our lives.
I encourage you to read the lesson in detail and take notes to fully understand the material. It is important to engage with this topic and think critically about your own financial goals and aspirations.
By understanding the importance of seeking wealth over money or status, you can develop a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial success. I look forward to exploring this topic with you in more detail during our upcoming lesson.

Happy learning!","transform":"

After that, we will in depth discuss the project.
16/03/23, 22:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, may I know how's your family now after the loss?
16/03/23, 22:19 - Whitney EWYL22E1205: We are taking things a slow a sted at a time but we are well
16/03/23, 23:03 - Saloni Rastogi: You have concluded the understanding of the lesson so well. Even my learning has been that 'Money is simply a tool that we use to transfer time and wealth, and that status is not a measure of true success or happiness. Instead, focus on building wealth and creating a life that brings you joy and fulfillment.' 
And you know _earning scholarship credits_ is just parallel to creating that joy and fulfillment and aiming higher by seeing how much you have earned and beating all the records.
16/03/23, 23:03 - Saloni Rastogi: I am open to hear you about in case you feel like sharing something with me for the loss. I am sure with time everything will get better.
16/03/23, 23:58 - Whitney EWYL22E1205: Thank you and when i need an ear i will talk to you

So, think about it and plan tomorrow accordingly.
Till then, have great day?
18/03/23, 21:13 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings *my proud edoofian*!

Here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!
18/03/23, 21:15 - Saloni Rastogi: I see that you have created the group for the community building projects. Now let me share with you the content that you can use to update the group.

07/04/23, 21:46 - Saloni Rastogi: With this, I would dedicate the session today on the EWYL Line for the discussion of:
1) Wednesday's lesson on consistency
2) Project discussion
07/04/23, 23:19 - Saloni Rastogi: I completely agree with you and I am happy to see the consistency in your sharing your response.

Let me summarize the lesson for you.
▪️Consistency is the key to success in any aspect of life, and the same applies to a
student's skill development and career growth. 
▪️Firstly, consistency in studies is crucial for a student's academic success. This not only helps students to cover the syllabus in time but also ensures that they have a clear understanding of the concepts. 
▪️Secondly, consistency in practice is vital for developing skills. 
▪️Lastly, consistency in learning is crucial for career growth. 

Consistent studies, practice, and learning are essential for achieving academic success, developing skills, and staying ahead on the job market
07/04/23, 23:22 - Saloni Rastogi: So for community building:
1) Keep the group updated DAILY.
2) Try reaching out to students from different schools 
3) Try reaching out to teachers from your school or others and ask them to share the link to your WhatsApp group with other school teachers from different schools
4) In the group just:
-please give 'only admins' access
-just ask the students\/participants to DM you to know about Edoofa and to get the form
-once they DM you, share about Edoofa with them
-Before sharing the form, ask them to get you added to their school groups
-once they do that, then only share the form with them.
5) Use social media as your sword to tell people about Edoofa

10/04/23, 18:41 - Saloni Rastogi: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!
