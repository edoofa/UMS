I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
01/12/23, 15:49 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0741: Noted
01/12/23, 15:50 - Ananya: Now, I believe that we should start with something that aligns with your interests. So, would you like to tell me which one is your favorite project: the community building or the schools connect?
01/12/23, 15:54 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0741: My favourite is community building though am trying to focus more on school connect
01/12/23, 15:54 - Ananya: Well, that's great! So may I ask about your progress in that project, so far?

01/12/23, 16:05 - Ananya: Alright, should I give you a few ideas for finding potential students?
01/12/23, 16:05 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0741: Yes please
01/12/23, 16:09 - Ananya: You know, one of my students' friends is studying in a different school. She has actually joined their WhatsApp class groups and is now communicating with them. Not only that, since she is connected with students from various schools, she is also obtaining the contact information of school administrators. This way, she is working on two separate projects simultaneously.
Don't you think it is an amazing idea?
01/12/23, 16:11 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0741: Thats a brilliant idea
01/12/23, 16:14 - Ananya: Indeed, so do you have friends  in another school?

01/12/23, 16:17 - Ananya: Alright, in addition to the resources we already have in our EWYL group, I was thinking of sharing a few more with you. This way, you can then pass them along to your students and school heads.
01/12/23, 16:20 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0741: Please that would also help
01/12/23, 16:21 - Ananya: You can also share our Edoofa Instagram page.
Additionally, did you know that the First Lady of Zimbabwe took time during her visit to India to meet the CEO of Edoofa? How can this be a fraud?
Moreover, did you know that Edoofa was one of the official sponsors of the NSQC event this year?

This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

05/12/23, 16:39 - Ananya: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
05/12/23, 16:39 - Ananya: *Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into ‚Äì the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work ‚Äì a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.üåü

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.ü§ù

15/12/23, 15:35 - Ananya: Good morning, Emmanuel!
I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!
Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!üçìü´ê
15/12/23, 15:36 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0741: Thats good to know
15/12/23, 15:40 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0741: I went through the newsletter

15/12/23, 15:48 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0741: And how far can i explain to them about the edoofa because other companies are saying they're work is not aligned with there work
15/12/23, 15:52 - Ananya: Well, as of now, Emmanuel, we have put our first project on hold due to the hectic schedule of our program director. Once we resume the project, I will schedule a separate session for it so that we can discuss it all. Is that alright?
15/12/23, 15:52 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0741: Yes ma'am
15/12/23, 15:55 - Ananya: To begin with, may I inquire if you had the chance to review your Wednesday lesson?
15/12/23, 15:55 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0741: Yes i did
15/12/23, 16:04 - Ananya: That's great! What did you learn from it? I am quite excited to hear your thoughts on the lesson!
15/12/23, 16:20 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0741: I learned in this dynamic and changing world of academia students find themselves alighned with tasks,duties and different things that test successful journey, as they venture in the academic journey two virtues are to be considered which is harswork and honesty.
Honesty is the cornerstone of integrity. It plays crucial roles in a students life. For example one has to be honest with themselves because it sharps the understanding of capabilities,strenghth and weaknesses. Being honest with oneself builds a successful future of a student.
Hard work is striving hard with a determined conscious to achieve a certain goal. Working hard can lead you to success in what you are aligned with as a student and also act as a backbone of success in future. Working hard and honesty sharp our life in the professional world. This is abit of summary for what i understood
15/12/23, 16:25 - Ananya: Absolutely, your summary resonates with my understanding. In the ever-evolving landscape of academia, students encounter numerous challenges, tasks, and responsibilities. Amidst this dynamic journey, two crucial virtues come to the forefront: hard work and honesty.
15/12/23, 16:26 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0741: That is true
15/12/23, 16:36 - Ananya: Well, Emmanuel, I had a discussion with your admissions officer today, and I learned that you have completed your initial journey, and you are about to receive an offer letter from the university! I am so happy to hear that. How are you feeling? Are you excited enough?
15/12/23, 16:37 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0741: Yes am very excited am edgar to know which university I'll be learning from
15/12/23, 16:58 - Ananya: Well, that's great! By the way, I understand that we couldn't have a fruitful session today, but I would still suggest working hard on your projects by utilizing the weekends. Remember, I am saying this with experience; the credits you can earn now will be helpful throughout your journey, and for that, I am determined to keep your spirits high and push you to the fullest!

Did you know that the tradition of hanging stockings by the fireplace comes from the legend of St. Nicholas? According to the story, St. Nicholas dropped gold coins down the chimney of a poor man's house, and they landed in the stockings that were hanging by the fire to dry. From then on, the tradition stuck, and now many of us hang stockings as part of our Christmas celebrations. üß¶‚ú®

Now that we've kicked off with a festive fun fact, how can I assist you in today's session? üòäüéÅ
19/12/23, 15:46 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0741: One of the applicants asked if in there is food and course offered by edoofa because it's not there on the form and also wanted to know some of the universities aligned with edoofa

19/12/23, 15:55 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0741: That's what I told them but i needed clarification
