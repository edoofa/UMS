18/05/23, 19:19 - Tatenda EWYL22E1189: To start with , leadership skills are essential in work places and organisations because people will be looking after you and leading them to success would be your responsibility. However,  according to Larry. C Spears there are 10 most important characteristics or attributes of a good leader and leadership. These are listening, empathy,healing,awareness, persuasion, conceptualization, stewardship, foresight,commitment to the growth of people and building societies or communities. These characteristics are further explained in Wednesday lesson's document.However i understood that in order to become a good and respectable leader like Mr Angad and Avreen Singh , one needs to posses these characteristics. Every influential person possess the characteristics thus you will automatically become an inspirational being to others which will give them hope to success.

29/05/23, 14:10 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above

29/05/23, 14:11 - Tatenda EWYL22E1189: 
29/05/23, 14:16 - Tatenda EWYL22E1189: The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making difference in the world. The story also give us the importance of having good leadership skills which led Andy to convince others to work with him.Moreover , the story reviewed that in order to make someone understand you and help, you need to give an example yourself so that they can follow. Therefore hardwork and determination is very essential in our lives.
29/05/23, 17:34 - Ananya: Greetings, How are you today? How was your weekend?

Do let us know if you attended the meet and greet and one point of unforgettable moment you had in the comments below.
22/06/23, 17:35 - Ananya: Greetings,
How are you today? Are you ready for your session?
22/06/23, 18:08 - Tatenda EWYL22E1189: Greetings to you too. I am ready for the session
22/06/23, 18:09 - Ananya: May I ask if you were able to read your wednesday lesson?
22/06/23, 18:10 - Tatenda EWYL22E1189: I was able to read it
22/06/23, 18:14 - Ananya: That's amazing! So would you like to brief me about the same?
22/06/23, 18:15 - Tatenda EWYL22E1189: Very well Ms Ananya. Let me share my understanding of the Wednesday session to you
22/06/23, 18:29 - Tatenda EWYL22E1189: In short, I understood that Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was a dedicated and strong woman who managed to become the first female president of Africa. However,  this presidency was not handed to her because of wealth or social status but rather her ability to rule and leadership qualities. These qualities include breaking of gender barriers, empowerment of youth and women , leadership in difficult times such as civil wars, diplomatic change and environmental stewardship. Her legacy teaches us as Edoofians how to become a great leader in both good and difficult times. Thus Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is an inspiration to every African student.
22/06/23, 18:34 - Ananya: Absolutely,the story of this great former president has provided us with a wealth of wisdom and insights, transforming our outlook on life and inspiring us to embody determination, resilience, unity, equality, honesty, and stewardship in our own journeys.
