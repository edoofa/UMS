13/12/22, 19:20 - Tenzin: Hello, my dear proud Edoofian. 
I hope all is well with you. 

Effective and timely feedback is a crucial part of a successful performance, as I discussed with you in our Saturday activity. Before our Session , I wanted to get in touch with you to share your EWYL report card and ask you to evaluate your performance by responding to the following questions:

1. How would you rate your performance from 1-10, 10 being the highest score?
2. What is your goal- in terms of skills and amount of scholarship credits that you want to earn?
3. What is your plan- how will you achieve the above mentioned goal?

The answers you give here will be evaluated by Ms Deepali and Ms Davi. So take you time and share your responses here in the group itself before our session.
14/12/22, 08:41 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0419: I rate my performance as 6. I wish to earn as many credits as possible such that my remaining fees will be adjusted to zero. To achieve that, I'm going to work extra hard learn endurance.

14/12/22, 18:27 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0419: Good morning.
14/12/22, 18:28 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0419: I am a proud Edoofian.
14/12/22, 18:30 - Tenzin: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

15/12/22, 23:33 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0419: Okay , but I made the last significant progress on 12 Dec. I don't know maybe it's my cellphone that has a problem. I tried to use Google to collect information on the companies but to know avail. On the other hand, I can't log in to my LinkedIn account. I even tried to download the app but I could not. Maybe if I find another phone it would be easier. Right now I've tried everything I thought can help but I'm now out of ideas.
16/12/22, 00:56 - Tenzin: Tanatswa, May I know if you have any solution for the above mentioned issue?
16/12/22, 00:57 - Tenzin: Edoofian, You must have realised that we haven't discussed the Report card that I shared with you.
Let us make sure that we have our discussion on that in our next session, okay?

17/12/22, 19:52 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0419: Okay I'll
17/12/22, 21:23 - Tenzin: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, 
_I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?_

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!
18/12/22, 07:33 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0419: It is a well known saying that giving with love and happiness brings more joy than receiving. As a result, people often try to give gifts to as many people as they can. There are also many events whereby people share gifts. On these events or days , everyone will be expecting gifts from loved ones; friends and family. These include weddings, birthdays and the famous Christmas day among others. Each of these days has its own tradition and way different from each other, but there is one thing in common; each of the loved ones want or wishes to give the best gift. Of interest among the events I mentioned earlier is the Christmas day. It has its own interesting tradition, the tradition of the secret Santa. It is after our Wednesday wisdom that I came to understand the origin of the famous ' secret Santa ' Christmas tradition that is practised with so much joy worldwide, by everyone regardless of religion, age, geographic location or culture. On this upcoming Christmas, I would like to be a secret Santa to my younger brother. I want to buy him a Bluetooth speaker he always admired . I know it can not be the best gift of all the gifts he will receive but I believe he is going to like it and treasure it wholeheartedly. As a student that's the best I can afford for him but in the future, I will try to give him something more than that and celebrate our Christmas day with so much joy and happiness. It is also my wish to be a secret Santa to as many people as I can and continue with the tradition of giving without being identified!

Then we return home and prepare a feast of very delicious dishes and enjoy as a family. After that family members secretly put their gifts in a room . Then the older members visit relatives while the the young ones go with friends to the local shops and complete the day. People open their gifts on the 26th. One of the Christmas days I will always remember is the Christmas day of 2018. All the family members were present and we received a lot of gifts. I personally received a blue track suit and many other gifts.

23/12/22, 00:05 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0419: No, due to the same problem. I am actually planning to buy a new device, after that I hope the problem would be resolved. As long as I still have this phone, I don't think I will make any remarkable progress.

23/12/22, 00:23 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0419: I'm able and I understood everything, but to put that in practise, there comes the problem. For example I tried to use LinkedIn but I could not log in using my Facebook account. I tried to download the app but to no avail. When I tried to use Google, a little information was provided. The problem is that my cellphone has a weak signal that's what I concluded.
