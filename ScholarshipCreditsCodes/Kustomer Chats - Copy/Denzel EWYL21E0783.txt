It includes machines (like computers) but also techniques and processes (like the way we produce computer. Firstly, i want to mention the benefits or the advantages of technology to the world especially to us as Africans cause i believe we still growing and we need to grow so the ease of Access to Information is one of the advantages of technology. For instance, we use internet to search what we do not know and we use socialmedias like whatsapp instagram.. Facebook.. to communicate like what we are doing now you are faraway but we can reach each other which is good and very impressive.  The World Wide Web, abbreviated as www has made the world a social village. ... 
Saves Time. ... 
Ease of Mobility. ... 
Better Communication Means. ... 
Cost Efficiency. ... 
Innovation In Many Fields. ... 
Improved Banking. ... 
Better Learning Techniques. Above are the merits of technology. However technology has some demerits on it Technology Causes Lack of Interest in Studying. ...
Technology Causes Environmental Problems. ...
Technology Reduce the Creativity of People. ...
Technology Causes Health Problems in Peoples. ...
Security Issues in Using the Technology. ...
Modern Technology Waste our Tim.Yes technology might have demerits but we need especially in Africa where some of us are living in a way back life so i say technology is good to us as people living in a mordenised world

13/07/22, 14:56 - Denzel EWYL21E0783: Firstly, I would say most designers are familiar with the concept of “design thinking” as a UX process..........  This process has five stages in it: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. Most design processes originate from this concept.... Besides that, Gain industry-recognized certificates with Inbteraction Design Foundation courses. Interaction Design Foundation courses to suit...Apart from that,Being enrolled in some graphical school online

13/07/22, 17:32 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride.

You know witnessing a knowledge deficient, gender sterotyped, chemical ignant..... Less developed society and country. I developed passion and vision to unlock and transform the country and the world at large also pace towards the fourth revolution of medicine in the society together with industry for optimized development. Besides that, decisions based on maturity and competence are less hypothetical and fictional but instead they are very practical and reastic that is exactly the case of my decision of taking it to to medical laboratory technician. I have realized the deficiency of this aspect in my country and I have challenged myself to sacrifice my life for this objective. I took a glimpse of how backwards our medical industry in comparison with other first class country  my heart bled with agony. It pains how our industry  are still running around 1960machines, my eyes get teary seeing how our industry is struggling to be ranked second from last. What gets me emotional about this is the underutilization of the overflowing potential within it. My plan is ti make a difference renturing into new adventures exploring and be the

14/07/22, 21:56 - Denzel EWYL21E0783: [13\/07 17:04] Vilsha Adm Off: Denzel, I have gone through your above message and I certainly understand that you wish to pursue your education in India to get a better career for yourself. However, If you want us to help you with your educational plans, I believe you need to be quite vocal and transparent about your preparations for your higher education.
[13\/07 17:04] Vilsha Adm Off: Last, when we had a conversation with you and your parents, they mentioned that they would be able to raise your fee in two parts before the end the of June and end of July respectively, they seemed quite confident too, but unfortunately, the money they were expecting did not come up as expected and so you asked for an extension till 30th of July, now today you mentioned that your parents are facing a financial challenge because of which they are unable to help you with your educational plans? Can you help me understand what changed all of a sudden so that I can get clarity on your situation?
[13\/07 20:36] Denzel Ndima: It's due to financial constraints.  My  parents could not raise the fees as we are poor

So I think coding has some merits on it that overcome the demerits thereby it becoming more effective, 
Advantages of learning coding in this early age isCoding can help you understand technology, It can enhance problem-solving skills, Coding can complement creativity
Coding can improve career prospects... With these listed coding classes  is more effective
