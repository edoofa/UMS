04/12/23, 13:44 - Moreblessing EWYL23E0132: I'm having difficulty times to reach different school heads as their students would say they don't have their school heads number
04/12/23, 13:51 - Aditi Kapoor: I understand the challenges you're facing in reaching out to different school heads. It can be quite frustrating when students don't have access to their school heads' numbers. In such situations, perhaps exploring alternative communication channels or contacting the school administration directly might be helpful. Additionally, you could consider reaching out to educational authorities or coordinators who may assist in connecting you with the relevant school heads.
