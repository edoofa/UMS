14/07/23, 16:52 - Ananya: I understand, have you discussed this with the admissions team?
14/07/23, 16:55 - Hazel EWYL22E0523: No not yet
14/07/23, 16:55 - Hazel EWYL22E0523: But do not worry I'll inform them
14/07/23, 16:55 - Ananya: Discuss with them Hazel, they will help you.
14/07/23, 16:55 - Ananya: Now, may I ask if you are working on any project?
14/07/23, 16:55 - Hazel EWYL22E0523: Okey thank you
14/07/23, 16:57 - Hazel EWYL22E0523: Yes I have been having talks with some of my former classmates and other members of our community about edoofa scholarships program
14/07/23, 16:59 - Hazel EWYL22E0523: They seem to be interested in joining but they want to firstly be financially stable
14/07/23, 17:00 - Ananya: I understand, let me help you.Search for "High schools in your county/nearby place/province" to find a list of schools.
Use Google to search for the specific school's name and locate their Facebook or Instagram page.
On their social media page, check the followers or moments section to find students studying there.
Look for the contact information of the school head or principal.
Connect with the school head while simultaneously reaching out to the students for your community building project.
14/07/23, 17:01 - Hazel EWYL22E0523: Okey thank you for the guidelines
14/07/23, 17:03 - Ananya: This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
▪️With consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success
▪️Visiting schools physically can put a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
▪️With this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, leadership quality, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear to present himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.
14/07/23, 17:03 - Ananya: .
14/07/23, 17:06 - Ananya: So, if you have schools nearby, I would definitely suggest you to visit them personally! You can also get printouts of the offline application forms and distribute them to students in those schools. You know, one of our students was doing this, and it proved to be fruitful.
14/07/23, 17:08 - Hazel EWYL22E0523: Ok thank you for the heads up
14/07/23, 17:10 - Hazel EWYL22E0523: Ok but I have a question.uhm is there a very big need for a t-shirt labelled edoofa ?
14/07/23, 17:16 - Ananya: No, dear!
14/07/23, 17:17 - Ananya: I also want you to follow his ideas and earn more and more credits. I really want that I will be giving your examples to my other student. So work hard.
Now let us connect in our next session. Happy weekend and all the best!
