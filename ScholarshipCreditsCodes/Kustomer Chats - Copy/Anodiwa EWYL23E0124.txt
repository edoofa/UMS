05/10/23, 16:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Before we begin, as you have come on the EWYL Line, you have already completed some basic formalities. Now, I would like to talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.

I kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let me know.
05/10/23, 23:15 - Anodiwa EWYL23E0124: We finally agreed with Ma'am Saloni that we put the programme on hold. It's end of year and we kind busy so it's for the best interest of us both to hold it on until ANODIWA is through with her final examinations. Thank you. I'm a proud Edoofian ‚úçüèª‚úçüèª
