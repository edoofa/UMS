15/12/23, 17:44 - Dalitso EWYL23E0964: Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am  Dalitso Steve Kamtimaleka and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is  Dalitso EWYL23E0964
19/12/23, 15:12 - Dalitso EWYL23E0964: I am a proud Edoofian
19/12/23, 15:12 - Ananya: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

We conducted a webinar on 'The Art of Persuasion' with our distinguished speaker, Mr. Oduola Olaoluwa - Public Speaking and Personal Development Caoch

Elevate your skills and broaden your horizons with Edoofa's commitment to education for all
19/12/23, 15:19 - Dalitso EWYL23E0964: Thank you for sharing the knowledge
19/12/23, 15:46 - Dalitso EWYL23E0964: Am ready to proceed with our discussions
19/12/23, 16:29 - Ananya: Good day, Delight! üéÑ‚òÄÔ∏è

Did you know that the tradition of hanging stockings by the fireplace comes from the legend of St. Nicholas? According to the story, St. Nicholas dropped gold coins down the chimney of a poor man's house, and they landed in the stockings that were hanging by the fire to dry. From then on, the tradition stuck, and now many of us hang stockings as part of our Christmas celebrations. üß¶‚ú®
Now that we've kicked off with a festive fun fact, how can I assist you in today's session? üòäüéÅ
19/12/23, 16:36 - Dalitso EWYL23E0964: That‚Äôs a very interesting fact to learn . 

First of I tried to connect with my schools head via WhatsApp but was unavailable so I gave him a call and was pleased about it and wanted to know if he will be connecting with the directors of Edoofa so that he makes time depending on his schedule. 


And I was able to connect with about 5 on the community building project on which am waiting for them to discuss with their parents
19/12/23, 16:38 - Ananya: That's incredible, Dalitso! So, have you asked the school head to fill out the form?
19/12/23, 16:40 - Dalitso EWYL23E0964: I recently sent it to him since his line wasn‚Äôt active so am waiting for his response
19/12/23, 16:45 - Ananya: Great, you know, 2023 is wrapping up. Don't you think we should kick off the new year with something big? How about committing to earning a specific amount of scholarship credits?
After all, you wouldn't want to head to India empty-handed.

I'm saying this from my own experience ‚Äì having some credits before you arrive in India isn't just a benefit for you; it's a help for your parents too. Not only this, we often pick students for internships and personal training based on their credits and regularity in the EWYL journey.
Believe me, you've got plenty of time right now being in your home country, so don;t you think we should utilize this time with our utmost dedication?
19/12/23, 16:47 - Dalitso EWYL23E0964: That‚Äôs very much true and the dedication will be out of this world
19/12/23, 17:00 - Ananya: Absolutely, I've finalized a few students for a 30-day challenge, and I want you to be a part of it. I need you to attend the sessions dedicatedly and put in the hard work for your EWYL projects.
Moreover, I'll set specific targets for you, and I want your commitment to work diligently to achieve them. As your mentor, I'll be there to guide and support you every step of the way. Is that alright with you?
19/12/23, 17:01 - Dalitso EWYL23E0964: Yes it‚Äôs alright with me
19/12/23, 17:03 - Ananya: Amazing! Let's set a new target for you. For the first 10 days out of the 30, I want you to focus on connecting with two schools and getting eight students to submit their offline application forms.
If you encounter any challenges during this time, reach out to me immediately because we need to achieve this target. I expect you to give it your best effort. Good day!
19/12/23, 17:05 - Dalitso EWYL23E0964: Okay I will get on that
20/12/23, 16:31 - Ananya: Happy Wednesday‚ú®
üöÄ Brace yourself for a lesson sprinkled with knowledge and a dash of holiday cheer! üéÑüéÅ

Today's Wednesday Wisdom is not just special but carries a powerful reminder of the true essence of Christmas. As we stand on the brink of the festive season, it's crucial to reflect on the values that unite us as a community.

Beyond the glittering lights and festive decorations, Christmas serves as a poignant reminder of the core values that bind humanity together. It's a time when love, compassion, and generosity take center stage, fostering a sense of togetherness and shared joy.

Let's take a moment today to embrace the spirit of Christmas, appreciating the significance of our connections with one another. The lessons learned during this festive season go beyond the celebration itself, leaving a lasting impact on the way we interact with those around us.

May this Wednesday Wisdom inspire you to carry the spirit of Christmas not just during the holiday season but throughout the year! üéÑ‚ú®

Wishing you a joyous and reflective Wednesday!

Warm regards,
Team EWYL

22/12/23, 16:18 - Dalitso EWYL23E0964: The Wednesday lesson was about Christmas. 

Christmas is a time of joy and festivities and although it may vary from region to region its core value is in the spirit of love and spending time together as families. 

The celebration that take place during this time are gift giving, family gatherings, feasting and merriment and finally decorations and lights . 

All these celebrations are important because it brings about the spirit of love in households and those around us. 

Not forgetting the core values of values that are forgiveness and reconciliation, Gratitude, charity and generosity and love and compassion.

This core values are important because they help us understand and remember what Christmas truly is about
22/12/23, 16:28 - Ananya: Great! Now, I remember you were a part of the 30-day challenge. Can I know your progress with that? Also, how exactly are you working toward the projects?
22/12/23, 16:34 - Dalitso EWYL23E0964: I connected with several people and managed to discuss with them about the program in which 4 discussed with their parents and submitted their forms and am still waiting on the rest .. 

I connected with the school too and share my experience applying into the Edoofa scholarship program and said he should schedule his time in order to connect and learn more about the program and said he will get back to me very soon .
22/12/23, 16:34 - Dalitso EWYL23E0964: Should I send the 4 application forms now ?
22/12/23, 16:36 - Ananya: Yes, you can share those now.

I hope you also had a wonderful time

02/01/24, 15:57 - Ananya: Well, I can see that you have shared progress with me about your projects, however, you didn't share your new year resolutions with me.
02/01/24, 16:12 - Dalitso EWYL23E0964: My new year resolutions are mostly similar with those of last year but with new changes there and there

1. Make Money: Start by setting a savings goal and creating a budget. Look for part-time jobs, freelance opportunities, or explore ways to monetize my hobbies or skills.

2. Improve Academics: Set specific goals for each subject and create a study schedule. Seek help from teachers, join study groups, and make use of online resources. Stay organized and consistent with my efforts.

3. Travel to New Places: Research destinations that interest me and create a travel bucket list. Save money specifically for travel and plan my trips in advance. Not forgetting to explore local attractions and immerse myself in the culture.

4. Explore: Besides traveling, exploring my  own city or town. Discover hidden gems, museums, parks, or local events. Keeping an open mind and being curious about new experiences
02/01/24, 16:17 - Ananya: Amazing!  This morning, the head of our department, Ms. Sanjana, and I discussed our students' performance in the EWYL project. I am delighted to see how consistently you have been performing, especially in the community-building project. Not only have I recognized your efforts and performance, but Ms. Sanjana has also acknowledged them. Therefore, both of us have decided to provide you with some personal training for this project, aiming for you to excel and achieve even better results than ever!
02/01/24, 16:19 - Dalitso EWYL23E0964: That would be truly amazing and wonderful thank you
02/01/24, 16:21 - Ananya: Great! So, let us begin our specialized training session from our next session which is on Friday. I hope to see you there on time.

If I am dedicating my extra attention and time to you, I want you to be on time and focus on your session with your undivided attention.
02/01/24, 16:26 - Dalitso EWYL23E0964: Yes, I will make sure to focus and dedicate myself to it
02/01/24, 16:35 - Ananya: Also, once we are done with our training, I have an interesting plan for you. We will be setting monthly targets according to your fee structure, aiming to earn enough credits to cover your tuition fee even before the designated time.
02/01/24, 16:49 - Dalitso EWYL23E0964: That‚Äôs fine by me
02/01/24, 16:58 - Ananya: Now, let us connect in our next session. Meanwhile, do not forget to follow your EWYL ritual in order to receive your Wednesday lesson!
02/01/24, 17:26 - Dalitso EWYL23E0964: Okay sure
03/01/24, 16:26 - Ananya: _Welcome to the *first Wednesday Lesson* of the year 2024_
I hope this message finds you well and ready for an enlightening session.

Today, our focus is on the incredible value of participating actively in student events, seminars, and workshops. These experiences are more than just extracurricular activities; they are a strategic investment in your personal and professional growth.

Get ready to engage in an interactive discussion in our upcoming session and share your thoughts on the impact of active participation on your educational journey.

05/01/24, 16:30 - Ananya: Dalitso, please accept my apologies for not being able to connect with you today. I was engaged in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

Considering that more than half of our scheduled time has already passed, I believe it would be wise to reschedule our session for the next available slot. In the meantime, I'd like to share that around this time last year, I implemented a monthly target system for my students based on their fees. They set financial goals for each month to cover their tuition expenses, and it proved to be highly beneficial. Many of them arrived in India with one semester's worth of fees saved, thanks to a year of planning. Recently, they successfully redeemed their credits to pay their tuition fees, fulfilling my wish for their financial success.

I am considering implementing a similar approach for you. Today, I encourage you to invest your free time in planning out this month by setting a target for yourself. Your monthly goal should be a minimum of $100. I wish you the best of luck, and I look forward to receiving your prepared plan by our next session. Good luck!

_Welcome to the first activity of the year!_
As part of today's Saturday activity, we invite you to share your personal experiences from any event you have attended, whether it be a seminar, workshop, or any other gathering. Our Wednesday lesson already highlighted the skills and experiences we can gain by our active participation in events that are aimed at sharing the Industry experience with young students.

Please take a moment to reflect on the event you attended, and share the key learnings, observations, and any memorable moments. Feel free to include pictures that capture the essence of the event.

For those who haven't had the chance to attend any events yet, don't worry! We encourage you to share your expectations from such gatherings. What do you hope to gain? What are your goals and aspirations when attending future events? This is a chance for you to articulate your thoughts and set intentions for your learning journey.

Remember, everyone's perspective is valuable, and by sharing our experiences, we create a supportive community that thrives on collaboration and shared knowledge. Let's make this Saturday activity a meaningful and insightful exchange of experiences and expectations. Thank you for your active participation!

Best regards,

Team EWYL
