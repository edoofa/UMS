May I please know your EWYL Group name for better clarity and communication.

26/08/22, 17:43 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian,
How excited are you for the weekend?
26/08/22, 17:44 - Rodney EWYL22E0449: Good morning.
26/08/22, 17:46 - Unknown: Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times pere week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you s
26/08/22, 17:49 - Unknown: Okay I understand we can come to a solution for this
26/08/22, 17:51 - Rodney EWYL22E0449: I am a proud Edoofian.
26/08/22, 17:52 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
26/08/22, 17:52 - Unknown: Today I wanted to discuss the recent message I shared with you. The message that we want to be our daily habit, our words of connecting and experiencing a sense of belonging, We all at team Edoofa are very thrilled as we personally are undertaking the same activity. May I know what have you understood from this message, what is the intention behind the same?
26/08/22, 18:06 - Unknown: You know what will happen when you every morning are saying that you are a proud Edoofian, you are sending a message to the universe that you believe in who you are, you are dedicated to this student community, you are part of the ambitious Edoofians. With help of the above text, can you define who an Edoofian is?
26/08/22, 18:08 - Rodney EWYL22E0449: An Edoofian is a passionate student who's being mentored by the team Edoofa and is eager and ready to help the community.

03/10/22, 22:11 - Unknown: Hello, my dear Proud Edoofians,

This week we took a step back and reflected upon the objective of the EWYL program. We collectively reflected on why we should be regular with our projects, what these projects will help us earn, and how all of this will result in our individual financial independence.

Today, let's work on the next step which is to plan how to be financially independent by utilizing your time with the right projects. As an activity for this week, I want you to draft a document mentioning:

a)Target- no. of credits you want to earn in the month of October
b)How many projects can you work upon
c)Number of hours that you can devote to your projects
d)Name of the projects that you want to be a part of
e)Plan of action with your mentors

You are required to submit these answers by 3rd October 2022. Let me know in case you face any challenges in Submitting the responses.
03/10/22, 22:24 - Rodney EWYL22E0449: I will submit the answers today.
04/10/22, 00:17 - Unknown: Yes edoofian, please submit them by EOD today
04/10/22, 05:30 - Rodney EWYL22E0449: Good evening. As for October I am targeting at least 3 credits. As for the projects they are easy to do during the day since I'll be on internet and from 1 pm to 3 pm I will be able to do the projects since it will be lunch and resting time. I think I am able to do two projects per time since I'll be having limited time for the projects. So as for the projects I will be doing the company link-up project and the school project.

Thank you.
04/10/22, 19:01 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
I hope you are doing well!
04/10/22, 19:20 - Rodney EWYL22E0449: Good morning, I am doing well.

06/10/22, 17:20 - Unknown: So we know, a lot of you have been keeping busy these days with your exams and academic curriculum. And while we wish you all the luck for it, we don't want you to miss out on your learning and skill building. In today's lesson, we will discuss how to build our capacity to multitask, manage our time and prioritize our daily tasks in order to have it all. 

Let's dig right in, and understand how if you follow these steps, you will be able to manage your exams, assignments, extra curriculars, and your EWYL projects all at one go. After going through this, you must discuss the plan of action to execute these steps with your mentors.

Happy Learning!

My number is activated again!
As per the survey I have found out that the three major skills to learn about are *leadership, networking and accountability*. So we will be learning about them today?
01/11/22, 20:51 - Unknown: Meanwhile, I have a task for you.
You will have to write a *GOOGLE REVIEW*, it is very easy and simple.

02/11/22, 21:59 - Rodney EWYL22E0449: Good afternoon.
04/11/22, 00:22 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We all have come across the quote, \"Quitters Never Win, and Winners Never Quit\", and we also must have experienced this in our lives, directly or indirectly.

If last week's lesson, taught you the mindset of a winner, this week's lesson is going to teach you the true nature of a winner. Someone, who never gives up, or quits on the dream they see and really want to fulfill, no matter what. Moving through scorching heat, drenching rains, and heavy snow, they reach their destination and complete their journey. In this lesson, you will also learn, what happens when an entire community inherits this trait and keeps working on it. How recognition is earned and respect is gained through time, patience, and endless efforts.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.
10/11/22, 21:59 - Rodney EWYL22E0449: Good afternoon.
11/11/22, 00:56 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian,
Hope you are doing well!
 
You will be getting a fun filled Wednesday lesson edoofian,
It is about *Personality development* , I would want you to learn and share your understanding as soon as possible because I think it is very important that we group ourselves at every stage of life!
11/11/22, 00:57 - Rodney EWYL22E0449: Goods day. That's alright.
11/11/22, 00:58 - Unknown: “When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.
 
In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.
 
I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.
 
Happy Learning.
11/11/22, 01:07 - Rodney EWYL22E0449: Thank you very much for the lesson.
19/11/22, 23:48 - Rodney EWYL22E0449: Good afternoon.
20/11/22, 19:28 - Unknown: Good day edoofian ,
Hope everything is well at your end!



I would like to share a brief message about the importance of planning in our lives and as an organization as well!


Planning is definitely significant as it directs us where to go, it furnishes direction and decreases the danger of risk by making predictions. The significant advantages of planning are provided below:
Planning provides directions: Planning assures that the objectives are certainly asserted so that they serve as a model for determining what action should be taken and in which direction. If objects are well established, employees are informed of what the company has to do and what they need do to accomplish those purposes.
Planning decreases the chances of risk: Planning is an activity which permits a manager to look forward and predict changes. By determining in prior the tasks to be completed, planning notes the way to deal with changes and unpredictable effects.
Planning decreases overlapping and wasteful activities: Planning works as the foundation of organising the activities and purposes of distinct branches, departments, and people. It assists in avoiding chaos and confusion. Since planning guarantees precision in understanding and action, work is conducted on easily without delays.
21/11/22, 23:20 - Rodney EWYL22E0449: Good afternoon

16/12/22, 16:57 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

16/12/22, 18:47 - Unknown: Hello, my proud edoofian!
Let us start your session.

I have a simple riddle for you to start with:
You can see it every day, but you cannot touch it. What is it?
16/12/22, 22:06 - Rodney EWYL22E0449: I guess it's the sun.
17/12/22, 00:11 - Unknown: It is the sky!
My proud edoofian with the competence and consistency you can touch the sky as well. With the right kind of determination everything is possible.
17/12/22, 00:42 - Rodney EWYL22E0449: Yeah the sky.
17/12/22, 00:48 - Unknown: Effective and timely feedback is a crucial part of a successful performance, as I discussed with you in our Saturday activity. Before our Session tomorrow, I wanted to get in touch with you to share your EWYL report card and ask you to evaluate your performance by responding to the following questions:

1. How would you rate your performance from 1-10, 10 being the highest score?
2. What is your goal- in terms of skills and amount of scholarship credits that you want to earn?
3. What is your plan- how will you achieve the above mentioned goal?

The answers you give here will be evaluated by Ms Deepali and Ms Davi. So take you time and share your responses here in the group itself before our session.
17/12/22, 00:52 - Rodney EWYL22E0449: I think I am at 5. My goal for now is to improve on communicating with executives on LinkedIn. I will try to be active on LinkedIn since I am always on the LinkedIn.
17/12/22, 01:42 - Unknown: What is your plan now to achieve the targets? 
What do you think should be your next step?
17/12/22, 02:14 - Rodney EWYL22E0449: I will target the managers of laboratories mainly for discussion purposes.
17/12/22, 02:24 - Unknown: I will help you with some tips:
1. Have a plan
Set goals at the beginning of the project and note the date. Have a deadline for it as well, it is good to manage the goals. Decide at the beginning how often you are going to work on the project.

2. Listen and listen
Listening in my opinion is more important than saying anything. Listen to the other person's problems and just by being there you might help the other person to think out loud and share their thoughts with you [ in reference to school headmasters and other students ].
18/12/22, 02:08 - Rodney EWYL22E0449: Good day, thank you for the tips.
