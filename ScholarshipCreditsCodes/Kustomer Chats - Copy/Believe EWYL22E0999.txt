31/01/23, 22:20 - Believe EWYL22E0999: My school is already connected to Edoofa

31/01/23, 22:31 - Unknown: Please excuse me for the delay but I have a lot of students who have their batches scheduled from this time, and I have to give equal attention to them. You are very crucial for me and I value all your responses but please understand the reason behind this delay.
31/01/23, 22:31 - Unknown: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead tomorrow.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him\/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
31/01/23, 22:32 - Believe EWYL22E0999: Ok you should have notified me earlier and now i know

31/01/23, 22:34 - Unknown: Now, Once you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering professional communication, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
31/01/23, 22:34 - Unknown: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
31/01/23, 22:34 - Unknown: So, This is what the First message should look like:
