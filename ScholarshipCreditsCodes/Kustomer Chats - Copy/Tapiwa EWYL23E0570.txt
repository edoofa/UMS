I trust you're doing well.

Looking forward to our productive conversation.
26/10/23, 15:46 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know why were you not present in your session yesterday?
26/10/23, 15:47 - Tapiwa EWYL23E0570: I am facing a problem on checking out the stories the page is not opening
26/10/23, 15:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share a screenshot of what is it showing so that I can help?
26/10/23, 15:49 - Tapiwa EWYL23E0570: Sorry for not being present yesterday, i had a double shift at work which started in the morning.
26/10/23, 15:50 - Saloni Rastogi: I can understand that at time work can be overwhelming but I would appreciate that you inform me once about the same prior to our session.
26/10/23, 15:51 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me make things easier for you. First, I would appreciate if you go through the Wednesday lesson and share with me what you have understood. Then we will discuss about African School Reform Mission Project.
26/10/23, 15:54 - Tapiwa EWYL23E0570: Okay i will send the screenshot
26/10/23, 15:54 - Tapiwa EWYL23E0570: Thank you for the Wednesday wisdom, i found it very inspiring and motivating.
26/10/23, 15:58 - Tapiwa EWYL23E0570: My number one lesson from the Wednesday lesson is that there are no boundaries in success and we can make our dreams come true if we work hard and stay focused on our goal
26/10/23, 16:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Well, you have truly caught the essence of the lesson and we have so many students from our Edoofian community itself who have shown that their is no boundary to success and hard work‚ö°
26/10/23, 16:04 - Tapiwa EWYL23E0570: Im sure i am going to be one of those students to also show and prove that there are no boundaries in success
26/10/23, 16:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes Tapiwa and I genuinely have a lot of expectations from you.
26/10/23, 16:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Now you talked about working on the African School reform mission project.

Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?

Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.

Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
26/10/23, 16:10 - Tapiwa EWYL23E0570: 1. GlenView high 1. No it's not connected to Edoofa
26/10/23, 16:11 - Tapiwa EWYL23E0570: On question 2 im not getting clearly what I'm being required to do
26/10/23, 16:11 - Tapiwa EWYL23E0570: 3. HARARE province
26/10/23, 16:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Okay, the second question says that if you are going to a school and talking about Edoofa, how will you introduce yourself as an ambassador at Edoofa and perks of being associated with Edoofa?
26/10/23, 16:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Tapiwa can you share your school's per term fees?
26/10/23, 16:16 - Tapiwa EWYL23E0570: Okay
26/10/23, 16:19 - Tapiwa EWYL23E0570: Firstly i would introduce myself and mention that I'm a former student of the school. I then carry on to give a brief overview of my journey since i left the school till i came to be part of the Edoofa program. I will explain about the edoofa program and its benefits and advantages it gives to students
26/10/23, 16:25 - Saloni Rastogi: This would be amazing Tapiwa, you have got the flow of it.
26/10/23, 16:26 - Saloni Rastogi: TODAY, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
26/10/23, 16:26 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.

There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head‚Äôs Contact.
26/10/23, 16:29 - Tapiwa EWYL23E0570: Okay ley me work on getting the school head's contact
26/10/23, 16:32 - Saloni Rastogi: After you get the contact details, please share it with here.
26/10/23, 16:32 - Saloni Rastogi: Our next step would be to establish good communication with them.
With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
26/10/23, 16:32 - Saloni Rastogi: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
26/10/23, 16:33 - Saloni Rastogi: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_
26/10/23, 16:33 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.
