I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL
27/11/23, 11:51 - TAFAFZWANASHE EWYL23E0093: Greetings. Here is my reflection on the spirit of success.
27/11/23, 11:51 - TAFAFZWANASHE EWYL23E0093: Competition is when individuals challenge each other for a profit or a prize. Competition has affected me in many ways.
When others were doing best at school l would feel intimidated and jealous. This resulted in me wanting to challenge them. Instead of lazing l worked hard, started studying and discussing with others. I also got engaged in friendships with the top students at school.
My grades started improving after that. Even though l could not get a prize, managed to score  top marks at school

Competitions can also be found at home where there other child does her chores well than the other.
 Knowing that the parents would usually favor the hardworking child will cause the other child to work hard too.
27/11/23, 15:37 - Ananya: Good morning, Tafafzwanashe!

Did you know that India and Africa share a rich history of diplomatic and trade relations that dates back centuries?

02/12/23, 15:50 - TAFAFZWANASHE EWYL23E0093: The Wednesdays lesson

I learnt about the power of analysis. When analysis a project or a task you have to identify the key inputs of a certain task.
Understand what is ahead of you, know the data, information and resources needed to perform a certain task.
Then you have to craft, develop and plan your task.
At the end you have to review your results. Identify areas of strength and weakness and learn from your mistakes.
02/12/23, 18:54 - Ananya: _*Hello, my Proud Edoofian*_!

This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

If you develop a habit of being punctual, doing things on time or achieving your goals you will reap success in things you do.
06/07/23, 13:17 - Ananya: That's absolutely true! Consistency plays a crucial role in achieving success. While it's natural to focus on big goals and grand achievements, it's the consistent effort and dedication that often lead to long-term success.

Its time for our Saturday Activity, I want you to delve into the realm of inspiration and write a detailed essay about a person whom you know personally and who embodies the remarkable trait of consistency. This individual has consistently demonstrated their dedication, determination, and unwavering commitment, becoming a true source of inspiration for you.

In your essay, please explore the key aspects of their life, experiences, and actions that exemplify their consistent nature. Describe how their consistent approach has positively influenced and impacted not only their own life but also the lives of those around them. Reflect on specific instances or situations where their consistent behavior or mindset has motivated you to strive for excellence or overcome challenges in your own life.

Feel free to include personal anecdotes, observations, or conversations that highlight the impact this person's consistency has had on your growth and development. Additionally, analyze the qualities, values, or strategies that you believe contribute to their ability to maintain consistency over time.
I am excited to read your insightful essays and learn about the inspiring individuals who have demonstrated the power of consistency.

08/07/23, 17:58 - TAFAFZWANASHE EWYL23E0093: In today's times, everybody is concerned with fulfilling their own interests. Every person would have a role model in life, someone to look upon, respect and aspire to be like. This is one of the ways to fulfill your dreams.
Being a teenager, various of expectations occur. In this stage we develop new personal tastes and preferences everyday but focusing on one goal at a time is a skill that requires consistency. I admire Lindiwe Mutungamiri who is my role model. I have known her since she was in high school. She was my senior and a head prefect. She was known of being a nerd and a very confident student at school. She had her own way of chasing goals. She studied a lot and got involved in several academic competitions like quiz and debate. Furthermore she was a top player in volleyball. Sometimes l wondered how she managed to balance school and sports. I saw her fail sometimes during middle term exams but the next term she would work hard and  become the top student. Everybody loved her.
At A level she scored straight A's and went to study abroad In Ghana. I followed her on all social media platforms that she was on. I could not believe that even in university she was still scooping prizes. It seemed that she was always supposed to be a leader everywhere she went. I was now listening to her on radio where she shared her experiences in university. I got to learn a lot from her. She also highlighted that posting on social media gave her some encouragement to push further and work hard.
Finally at twenty-four she obtained her computer science degree in 2022.She has shown good leadership with the decisions she made and is also in the same career study that l want to pursue in university which is programming. She is also a co-founder at LithAfrica and is now a businesswoman.

I feel great for knowing her and l  will keep on following her steps.In the next future l will also become someone's role model.

10/07/23, 13:44 - Ananya: Now may I ask if you were able to connect with any of the school heads?
10/07/23, 13:49 - TAFAFZWANASHE EWYL23E0093: I haven't been able to get in touch with them.
10/07/23, 13:58 - Ananya: May I ask why?
10/07/23, 14:03 - TAFAFZWANASHE EWYL23E0093: I'm trying to connect with students from other schools so that they can share with me their head's contacts also to know how to approach them since the students are ones who know them well.
10/07/23, 14:06 - Ananya: Alright, you know you can Search for "High schools in your county/nearby place/province" to find a list of schools.
Use Google to search for the specific school's name and locate their Facebook or Instagram page.
On their social media page, check the followers or moments section to find students studying there.
Look for the contact information of the school head or principal.
Connect with the school head while simultaneously reaching out to the students for your community building project.
10/07/23, 14:08 - TAFAFZWANASHE EWYL23E0093: I will do my best.
10/07/23, 14:09 - Ananya: Wonderful, now I hope you will complete your target by tomorrow!

How are you today? How was your weekend?
17/07/23, 13:06 - TAFAFZWANASHE EWYL23E0093: I am fine thank you. My weekend was good.
17/07/23, 13:11 - Ananya: Thank you for asking, it was good.
17/07/23, 13:31 - Ananya: So, may I ask if you are facing any challenges in the projects?
17/07/23, 13:36 - TAFAFZWANASHE EWYL23E0093: Yes I am. I am talking wit people who are not really interested in studying in India but only a few. However I believe some will believe after seeing others going.
17/07/23, 13:41 - Ananya: May I ask if you have schools nearby?
17/07/23, 13:44 - TAFAFZWANASHE EWYL23E0093: Yes there are a few nearby.
17/07/23, 13:46 - Ananya: Great, -Let me share with you how our star performer for the last week-Loice did complete her targets.
She shared three schools and you know she got to know about them through Google.
She simply searched on Google like 'School nearby'/'School in Harare'/'School in Manicaland' and so on. She was able to yield results.
So even without physically visiting them, she got to know about them through Google, got their contact details, and after that got in touch with them Via WhatsApp.
3)  please reach out to all your friends, peers, cousins, neighbors, school mates, to get their School Head's contact details.
4)  visit schools in your province, physical visits can add another touch to the conversations and make them a lot more impactful.
17/07/23, 13:48 - TAFAFZWANASHE EWYL23E0093: Alright l will try to do that.
17/07/23, 13:56 - Ananya: This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
▪️With consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success
▪️Visiting schools physically can put a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
▪️With this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, leadership quality, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear to present himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.

17/07/23, 14:11 - Ananya: Also, while connecting to the principles at schools I would recommend you to fill the form yourself by asking the details and do not leave it on them.
