I hope that you are in good health and spirits.

While going through our conversation, I noticed that you haven't submitted *Wednesday's Lesson* yet.
The deadline to make the submission is *Thursday* *6 PM*. Please make sure that you submit your response before that because the *Academic Board* keeps a very strict check on these things. 
 
The aim of this activity is to make you aware of the life journey of Patrice Motsepe and how you can inculcate his traits in your daily life.
15/07/22, 17:28 - Unknown: After you have gone through the above messave regarding the Wednesday Lesson, Let us start with our previous discussion on the Project Progress Form.
15/07/22, 20:29 - Aubergreastat EWYL21E0628: My key learnings from Patrice Motsepe are as follows
1) Your past can not define your future.....
No matter where you come from in terms of economic stability there is no limit to the heights you can achieve. Just like Patrice Motsepe, we should always remember that sky is the limit.

2) Partnership should be considered.
Many people easily forget the benefits of partnerships. In Patrice Motsepe’s road to success story, I  heard that in 1994 he became a partner at Gilfillan law firm which shows that  at times we get in a situation that might hold us back or one that restrains our abilities, partnership will help you out of such a bind.

3) Take up Challenges

I have noticed that, Patrice Motsepe’s life has always been about challenges, despite being born in poverty, he never looked down, and it is obvious poverty was his main strength. His story is telling us to  view any problem as a challenge and make it an opportunity to hit even greater heights because  whatever doesn’t kill you only makes you stronger.
15/07/22, 20:34 - Unknown: I am very happy after going through your response. ?
Proud Edoofians, These are the footsteps that we have to follow. The traits that he gained and possessed are not something that could be taught in schools\/ universities. That is why our head coach, Ms. Davi, tries that through every lesson you are able to get one step closer towards gaining these traits and making your career sucessful.
15/07/22, 20:35 - Unknown: Auber, Can you now please share your Project Progress Form?
15/07/22, 22:34 - Aubergreastat EWYL21E0628: Thank you very much sir

25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!
