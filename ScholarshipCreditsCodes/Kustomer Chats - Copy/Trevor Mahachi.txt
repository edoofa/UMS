How are you?
04/10/22, 00:37 - Unknown: This weekend's activity was very interesting. I am very excited to discuss how you, my proud student, have planned your way to becoming _the edoofian of the month_ and _accomplishing their targets_. This weekend activity asked students to tell the following:
a) Target- no. of credits you want to earn in October
b) How many projects can you work upon
c) Number of hours that you can devote to your projects
d) Name of the projects that you want to be a part of
e) Plan of action with your mentors

1. your response to the same
2. pending response to the Wednesday Wisdom

How are you?
06/10/22, 05:26 - Unknown: Please excuse me for the inconvenience caused yesterday, I was facing severe connectivity issues so I was not able to take your concerns.
Your session will be held on tomorrow as per our schedule since the organization is observing an off today on the eve of our religious festival, Dussehra.
Once I come back on Thursday for your session, I want that you get some research done on what is Dussehra and why it is celebrated, we will surely discuss it in our session on Thursday along with your Wednesday lesson response, which will be very much exciting?
06/10/22, 05:27 - Trevor Mahachi: Okay thank you
06/10/22, 19:43 - Unknown: Greetings of the day!
How are you doing?

As students, we constantly learn and expose ourselves to situations that help us learn anything and everything, but we must remember that each of us has the same number of hours in a day. Hence we must treat it important that we treat our Time as the currency of life. *Time Management* is essentially Priority Management.

In our session today on the *EWYL Line*, we will discuss:
1. How managing time is necessary
2. pending session on the weekend activity
06/10/22, 19:43 - Unknown: Along with this, please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' .

10/10/22, 22:57 - Unknown: Greetings Trevor!
How are you?
10/10/22, 22:57 - Trevor Mahachi: I am well
10/10/22, 22:57 - Unknown: It is important Trevor that you realize that I have all my time reserved for my students. I feel happy to motivate my students to learn new skills each week and share with me how those lessons have impacted and brought a change in them. And you know what, the way you want to earn scholarship credits and help yourself financially, I am working 10 times more than everyone so that all my students avail the best out of this opportunity. But I feel more saddened for the fact that each time I have to make you realize to follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', this is something which should be done by you without any reminders.
10/10/22, 22:57 - Unknown: Most of my time goes on reminding you to follow the daily ritual and keep on pushing you to share your understanding with me on the lessons and activities. Do you think that in this way we will be able to fulfill the main purpose of being connected with Edoofa?
Today, I want you to tell me whether you are actually interested in working as hard as I do for your growth and development or not?
If it is a yes, then of course I want equivalent activeness and consistency from your side as well.
And if not, then I would want you to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi that you don't want to continue with your EWYL Program despite consistent efforts from your mentor.

Please decide and let me know.
10/10/22, 22:59 - Trevor Mahachi: I am interested in working hard
10/10/22, 22:59 - Unknown: Then why is it that, I have constantly reminded you to follow the daily ritual?
10/10/22, 23:00 - Trevor Mahachi: OK l will surely do the daily ritual without reminders
10/10/22, 23:01 - Unknown: What about the responses for the activities and lessons and project work?
10/10/22, 23:03 - Trevor Mahachi: As of now l do not have any time table on the days that l will have my EWYL  sessions
10/10/22, 23:04 - Unknown: But you did not share this concern with me.
10/10/22, 23:05 - Unknown: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

12/10/22, 03:43 - Unknown: Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. Those unfamiliar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India.

I am amazed by the clarity and confidence in your speech, brilliant :fireworks:
13/10/22, 01:22 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian!
Hope you are doing well.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real-life example. That is how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because in the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.
Responses will be submitted on the EWYL Line only.

Happy Learning.

Now we have to start working on the community building project, do you remember all that I told you yesterday?
20/10/22, 21:32 - Unknown: I am happy to tell you that this weekend we are having our great Indian festival, Deepawali and you know this festival holds a special place in the hearts of all Indian families. So yesterday, everyone in our office wore Ethnic dresses and celebrate Deepawali's party where we exchanged gifts and lit up the office with diyas and candles.
Due to this, there was a delay in sending you the Wednesday lesson for this week.
Please see to it and we will have a session tomorrow on the same because I want to give you time to ponder and work on it.
20/10/22, 21:32 - Unknown: In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

22/10/22, 04:46 - Trevor Mahachi: The weeks lesson explained that for anyone to be success in anything there is need for hardwork. It was also highlighted that it takes a long period to and hardwork to achieve sucees but can take on only less effort to destroy the success The Wednesday lesson also highlighted the importance of feedback which help access the performance of the activities being done feedback also improves the confidance and awareness of students
22/10/22, 06:13 - Unknown: Very well noted.
22/10/22, 06:14 - Unknown: I read your response Trevor and I feel that the struggle exists to change us and our lives we struggle because it is the key to the path of our destination of what we want or what we want to become filled with challenges, knowledge, and so on. Without struggle, we humans won't be able to achieve what we have today.
We both have spoken on similar grounds and yes it was indeed a very inspiring tale.
22/10/22, 06:14 - Unknown: Yes, that's great Trevor.
It is a Hindu festival that marks the grand welcome of Lord Rama his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after long battle and hardships.
Moreover, the bigger significance that this festival taught me as a student and I want to teach you as well is that it marks the birth of a better version of ourselves, this day brings motivation to us to fight the evil in us and work for the best. It says aloud that, 'work hard, and struggle to strive for the good'.
Being your mentor, I want you to realize that you are made to do much bigger things in life and aim high. I want that you set aims in your life and work hard to achieve them.
Tell me, will you promise me that?
