I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.

Today's Wednesday Wisdom is not just special but carries a powerful reminder of the true essence of Christmas. As we stand on the brink of the festive season, it's crucial to reflect on the values that unite us as a community.

Beyond the glittering lights and festive decorations, Christmas serves as a poignant reminder of the core values that bind humanity together. It's a time when love, compassion, and generosity take center stage, fostering a sense of togetherness and shared joy.

Let's take a moment today to embrace the spirit of Christmas, appreciating the significance of our connections with one another. The lessons learned during this festive season go beyond the celebration itself, leaving a lasting impact on the way we interact with those around us.

May this Wednesday Wisdom inspire you to carry the spirit of Christmas not just during the holiday season but throughout the year! üéÑ‚ú®

21/12/23, 15:50 - Ananya: Good afternoon, Dalitso!

Let us begin our session with a thought! Have you ever wondered why Santa doesn't get a parking ticket on Christmas Eve? It turns out he has 'Sleigh Parking Only' privileges and his reindeer are excellent at navigating the skies without worrying about traffic laws. It seems Santa's got connections in high places ‚Äì or should I say, the North Pole!" üéÖ‚ú®
21/12/23, 15:52 - Dalitso EWYL23E0793: Of course üòÖ
21/12/23, 15:53 - Ananya: Now that we've started our session with some Christmas energy, it reminds me of yesterday's Wednesday lesson. Have you read the lesson filled with Santa and jingle bells?
21/12/23, 15:56 - Dalitso EWYL23E0793: Yes I have
21/12/23, 15:58 - Ananya: Great! Kindly share your understaning of the lesson with me.
21/12/23, 16:01 - Dalitso EWYL23E0793: It teaches that Christmas serves as a poignant reminder of the values that bind humanity together and not just gifts and glamour.
It also teaches us to love unconditionally, give generously, and appreciate the beauty of togetherness!!

21/12/23, 16:14 - Ananya: Alright, to begin with, I believe we should start something that aligns with your interest. So, may I ask, which one is your favorite project: the community building or the African reform mission?
21/12/23, 16:18 - Dalitso EWYL23E0793: Community building project 
Though it‚Äôs so hard to convince people about the goodness of Edoofa while am still here in Zambia
21/12/23, 16:20 - Ananya: I understand, Daltiso! You know you can search for students online. Let me help you with that.
21/12/23, 16:20 - Dalitso EWYL23E0793: Okey

21/12/23, 16:27 - Dalitso EWYL23E0793: Sure thanks !
21/12/23, 16:30 - Ananya: So for community building:
1) Keep the group updated DAILY.
2) Try reaching out to students from different schools
3) Try reaching out to teachers from your school or others and ask them to share the link to your WhatsApp group with other school teachers from different schools

27/12/23, 18:36 - Dalitso EWYL23E0793: Okey
28/12/23, 15:42 - Ananya: Good afternoon, Dalitso!

As we embark on today's session, I'd like to set a positive tone with a motivating quote:

"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that count." - Winston Churchill

Let's approach our work today with determination and a mindset geared towards progress. Together, we can achieve great things. Looking forward to a productive and inspiring session!üöÄ

28/12/23, 15:53 - Dalitso EWYL23E0793: Alright
28/12/23, 16:29 - Ananya: Time up!‚è∞
28/12/23, 16:29 - Dalitso EWYL23E0793: So, a few years ago, I think that was 2021,my family and I decided to do something different for the holidays. Instead of exchanging gifts, we wanted to give back to our community. We came up with the idea of organizing something like a charity drive.

We reached out to our friends, neighbors, and church members, explaining our plan and asking for donations. The response was so overwhelming! People were very excited to contribute and make a difference this time around.

On Christmas Eve, we set up a makeshift distribution center outside our yard.We sorted through the donations, which included clothes, toys, food, and even some monetary contributions. The next morning, we loaded up our cars and headed to a nearby orphanage.

When we arrived, the children were ecstatic to see us. We spent the day playing games, singing songs, and sharing stories. Then came the moment to distribute the gifts. The joy and excitement on the children's faces was priceless. It was a heartwarming experience to see how a simple act of kindness could bring so much happiness.

As the new year approached, we reflected on the impact we had made. It wasn't just about the material gifts; it was about the love and compassion we shared with those children. It reminded us of the true meaning of the holiday season.

Since then, we've continued our tradition of giving back during Christmas and New Year. It has become a cherished part of our family's holiday celebrations. It's incredible how a small idea can turn into something so meaningful and impactful.

Therefore I‚Äôve connected this with what Edoofa has taught me so far that the holiday season is not just about receiving, but also about giving and spreading joy to those in need. It's a time to come together as a community and make a positive difference. I hope this story inspires my fellow Edoofians to find your own unique way to make a difference during this festive season! üéÑüéâ
28/12/23, 16:36 - Ananya: Great! Well, let me tell you one thing this New Year Storytelling Competition is more than just a contest; it's a chance to enhance your quick thinking, creativity, and communication skills. These impromptu challenges cultivate adaptability, build confidence, and prepare you for real-world situations, from debates to professional endeavors. So, embrace this opportunity to express your unique perspectives, captivate with your creativity, and develop skills that will serve you well in various aspects of life. Best of luck, and let your storytelling prowess shine!
28/12/23, 17:11 - Ananya: Well, I was expecting a response from your end. You have not been attending your sessions for quite a long time now. I understand that balancing everything can be difficult; however, I would still suggest you at least discuss your challenges with me. Maybe I can assist you in managing your time.
28/12/23, 17:15 - Dalitso EWYL23E0793: Sorry it‚Äôs just the same network challenges

11/01/24, 13:39 - Ananya: A lovely morning to you, and kindly excuse me for the short delay. I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.
Not only this, but we also welcomed various industrial leaders, and it went super well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we teach them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. I hope that whenever you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/01/24, 16:06 - Dalitso EWYL23E0793: I really hope so too!!
11/01/24, 18:45 - Ananya: Now, I know it took me some extra time to find the pictures for you, and our session could not take place. We shall now resume our session on Monday. Meanwhile, I want you to follow your EWYL ritual daily so that you can receive the weekend activity.

Not only this, but since this week is completely off for you, I want to know your progress with your projects. You know, seeing over 400 students in this event has motivated me to work for my students even harder. I want you to be here in India and pay your fee all by yourself. For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed for a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?
