2. Write a short reflection on the experience, focusing on the following points:
* What was the situation and what were the challenges you faced?

07/03/23, 17:14 - Takunda EWYL22E0770: Morning  Sir   lm proud   Edoofian  .
07/03/23, 21:32 - Unknown: Greetings, Edoofian
I hope that you are doing well
07/03/23, 21:33 - Unknown: Let us start our Today’s session with this motivational quote:
“Learn from yesterday. Live for today. Hope for tomorrow.” – Albert Einstein
07/03/23, 22:28 - Takunda EWYL22E0770: Sorry  for  late  reply now  lm free
07/03/23, 22:36 - Unknown: No worries, Takunda
Let us start
07/03/23, 22:37 - Unknown: I hope that you have clarity till this point?
The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counselling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counselling session thereafter.
07/03/23, 22:39 - Takunda EWYL22E0770: Okey sir  we  can proceed
07/03/23, 22:41 - Unknown: As for attracting the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our Juniors who are in Form 5, and Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
07/03/23, 22:41 - Unknown: Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
07/03/23, 22:44 - Takunda EWYL22E0770: Oky Sir    l will try  to connect  with them
07/03/23, 22:46 - Unknown: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to STUDY IN INDIA with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
07/03/23, 22:55 - Takunda EWYL22E0770: Oky Sir   so l need  to find   first  group of  form 6
07/03/23, 22:57 - Unknown: Yes, You are right!
07/03/23, 22:58 - Unknown: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

And in a very similar manner, you can repeat the same process with the Form 5 students as well.
07/03/23, 22:59 - Takunda EWYL22E0770: Oky l will try to find  them    them l  wll give  you link after   l complete  the process
07/03/23, 23:14 - Unknown: Great!
07/03/23, 23:23 - Unknown: *Things to be on a look out for:*

1] ADMIN ACCESS:
07/03/23, 23:24 - Unknown: It is very important that we add the right Student (Applicant) to the group, so please make sure that you YOURSELF add the participants and don’t forward the link of your group blindly. 
It is done so that:
07/03/23, 23:24 - Unknown: 1) We have the right student, by the right student we mean that the groups should have students who are really serious and passionate about their higher education and want to use the scholarship as a stepping stone in their career.
07/03/23, 23:24 - Unknown: 2) We have the students who are known to you and or your friends who you feel that after your initial interaction with them are equally passionate like you to follow your footsteps and build your network. The other benefit being it will directly impact your scholarship credits.
08/03/23, 01:08 - Takunda EWYL22E0770: Oky Sir  l will do as you say
08/03/23, 01:54 - Unknown: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community building project, YOU ADD ME and make me the ADMIN of the Group.
Add my number +917696398732
08/03/23, 01:54 - Unknown: The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
08/03/23, 02:02 - Takunda EWYL22E0770: Oky sir    l will try  to mobilise  students .
08/03/23, 02:03 - Unknown: B] Individual reach out -
08/03/23, 02:03 - Unknown: You can also reach out to the students individually and discuss in detail the Edoofa Program. You should also discuss with them your journey right from submitting your application till you got connected with me. You can inform them about your counsellor, the interviews, admission processes, etc. and once that is done, you can ask them to fill out the Offline Application Form. One thing which you need to keep in mind is that you should only reach out to students who you feel are equally passionate and deserving like you to earn the scholarship. [preferably the ones who have completed their A-Level or are in Form 6\/Form 5]. Also, make sure that you share the correct information with the applicant while sharing the application form.

We will discuss the difference between wealth, money, and status, and how each of these concepts plays a role in our lives.

22/03/23, 22:48 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Ready for your dose of Wednesday wisdom?

I want to ask you a question: Have you Despised Wealth?

The concept of wealth has been a topic of much debate and discussion for centuries. While some view wealth as a means to achieve success and fulfillment, others may view it with suspicion or even disdain. However, it is important to understand that ethical wealth creation is possible and can be a force for good in the world. In this regard, it is essential to examine our own perspectives on wealth creation, and consider how they may impact our relationship with money, status, and success.

Read today’s lesson in detail and let's have a detailed discussion in our upcoming session. I am sure today’s lesson will lead to many fruitful discussions and will assist you in planning better for your journey towards wealth creation.","transform":"
