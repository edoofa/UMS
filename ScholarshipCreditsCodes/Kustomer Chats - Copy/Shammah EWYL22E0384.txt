15/11/22, 23:01 - Unknown: That's great Shammah!
15/11/22, 23:14 - Unknown: So Shammah, I hope you are aware of the three projects that we have right?
15/11/22, 23:16 - Shammah EWYL22E0384: Yes I am
16/11/22, 00:19 - Unknown: So can you briefly share with me about all three projects Shammah?
16/11/22, 00:44 - Shammah EWYL22E0384: In the first project the aim is for me to understand the field I'm going into and since the world has moved to be technologically driven I have a great chance to look into companies that have digitalized. Firstly I have to identify such companies in my country and\/or region. I can talk to my relatives, my friends relatives and others who are in such companies and tell them about my career choice, my objectives and how Edoofa is helping me acquire the skills I need especially after my graduation. Next is creating a LinkedIn account where I'll be able to connect to decision makers and employees in these these companies. I should reach out to these individuals and tell them or enlighten them about Edoofa.  Next I should setup a meeting  between Edoofa and these companies. In looking for potential companies there are 4 factors I should consider. The first is nature of company, the second is scale of the company, the third is financial stability of the company then lastly is the background of the company's founder. Along with these factors there are steps I should follow. The first step is searching where I can use either Google or LinkedIn. The second step is studying a little more about the company and it's functions. The third step is to study the company's website. This will help me get brief information on the founders and members. Step 4 is to check the various social media pages of the company. Step 5 is to understand and study the background of the founder and the core members. The last step is reaching out to these people by dropping an invitation and sending a connection request
16/11/22, 00:47 - Shammah EWYL22E0384: In the second project I'm supposed to approach my colleagues, friends and family members who want to study abroad. Tell them about Edoofa and give them the knowledge I got from my experience and from my counselor. I'm also supposed to tell them about the expenses of studying abroad and how Edoofa has helped students in this area and also I'm supposed to identify students who are highly oriented who are willing to study abroad. Once I identify these students an offline application will be sent to me which I will share however I will have to identify the serious students before I share the information I have.
16/11/22, 00:48 - Shammah EWYL22E0384: In the third project I'm supposed to reach out to local and speak to the decision makers to collaborate with Edoofa. Firstly I'm supposed to make a list of secondary schools in my local area. I can do this either through LinkedIn or through my personal network. Edoofa will help me reach out to them through messages and emails. A contract will be signed hence the decision makers of these schools and the Edoofa team will meet for the signing of this contract.

16/11/22, 22:33 - Unknown: Hello, my dear proud Edoofian. I hope all is well with you.

Another insightful Wednesday Wisdom is presented here. The lesson today teaches us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, disability. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition. A few questions near the end of the session will ask you to reflect and have an open dialogue with yourself. After you finish your lesson, as your mentor, I'd like to have a thorough conversation about your key take aways, in our upcoming sessions.

Enjoy the article and keep in mind that success does not come to you suddenly; rather, it can be attained over time by making modest, daily improvements.

Happy learning!

How are you?

The Wednesday lesson taught us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, _disability_. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition.

In our session, we will discuss:
1) your understanding of how disability is different from what we thought about it earlier
2) progress on the projects
18/11/22, 00:32 - Unknown: That's great that you will be working on the community building project!

18/11/22, 23:39 - Unknown: I liked the way he expressed himself. I would also appreciate it if you could go through the lesson and also share with me your thoughts.
19/11/22, 00:31 - Shammah EWYL22E0384: *Wednesday Lesson*
The lesson was based on disability, a topic that is not discussed a lot because disability is still associated with neglect, isolation and deprivation. But yet again disability reminds us that there is no such thing as normal. Edward (Eddie) Ndopu , an award winning activist from South Africa was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy at the age of 2. According to the doctors he wouldn't live beyond the age of 5 but with God's grace he has outlived himself by 25 years and counting. In a conversation he shares that today he is no longer able to do what he could do five years ago. His dreams were of becoming an artist but his disability has allowed him to dream new dreams. He talked about how his mother and how she was always there for him, he also admires her not just as a parent but as a human who sacrificed so much. Mr Ndopu is the founder of Beyond Zero, a platform for creating global change and seeing the possibilities that come from reduced inequalities and sustainable development. This teaches us that no matter what situation one is in, giving up should never be an option because each and everyone has their own gifts and talents and by believing in oneself will outshine all the disabilities.

I just finished my A level studies now I'm preparing for the next stage of life. My immediate aim for now is to go to University and I'm already in the right path. I aim on utilizing all the resources I acquire and giving it my best in my studies in order to accomplish my dreams. I hope to master a number of abilities which include patience, to enhance my leadership skills just to mention a few. After I've finished my degree program my goal is to come back to Zimbabwe, my home and start growing. I plan to start my own training company because forensic accounting is not a well-known career in Zimbabwe. Once I've started my company I plan on expanding my networks and go to other countries and share the knowledge I have acquired.

17/12/22, 03:14 - Shammah EWYL22E0384: *Wednesday Lesson*
The story of secret Santa is about a man who made the world help with his acts of kindness while keeping his identity a secret. In 1971 Larry Dean Steward, being homeless, hungry and broke he entered Dixie Dinner in Houston. He had no idea how he was going to pay for the meal. Cookie realized, Larry was in trouble so he handed him $20. It was enough to pay for the meal, fill up his gas tank and leave town. When Larry drove away he thanked God and promised that he would help others someday. Eight years later, recently fired from his job, Larry gave a big tip to a cold and tired waitress and remembered his promise. He drove to the bank and withdrew a third of his savings then he started handing it to people who looked like they needed a little boost. Within two to three years he started withdrawing hundred dollar bills to give away, and some knew him as the Hundred Dollar Bill Man while others called him Secret Santa. Those who he gave would give him hugs and tears and he never told them his real name. His elves were firefighters and his friends who helped him look for people in needed help. In 1999 Secret Santa tracked down Cookie and thanked him for rescuing him decades earlier. Santa travelled from city to city to help people hurt by terrorists, fires and even hurricanes. After 25 years of helping others, Larry trained other Santas to give money too in different cities. Today many Santas still carry out this tradition. What we learn from Santa is that anyone can be a Santa by giving and showing love and care to those in need. The only thing Secret Santa asks from the people he helps is that they do a good deed someday and help those that need help.

18/12/22, 04:02 - Unknown: Hello, my proud Edoofian!
I hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift or an expensive one. More often than not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful pieces of poetry for them. The act of gifting is beautiful, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?

Be as candid as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

22/12/22, 03:55 - Shammah EWYL22E0384: Good evening. My network is unstable but at least Ms Nabagala Caroline had finished her presentation. Thank you very much for the webinar with Ms. Nabagala Caroline. It was a great opportunity for me to be part of it. I got to learn a lot from the presentation. I also took away the quote she gave us, 'your brand is the single most important investment you can make in your business'. Thank you and I hope I will get this opportunity once again. Thank you
22/12/22, 21:46 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian!
Hope you are doing well.

With the new year coming, the whole team has gathered together to discuss some new year resolutions and opportunities that we can bring for you so that you grow tremendously. I want to assure you that I am always here for you and am always working hard along with you so that we make up the best team.

I hope you understand it.
