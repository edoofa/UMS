28/12/23, 15:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day,
How are you?

In our session for today we will discuss:
1. Understanding of the Wednesday lesson that was shared with you yesterday
2. Projects progress made so far
28/12/23, 15:48 - Praise EWYL23E0453: Am fine and you
28/12/23, 16:08 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing good, thank you!

I am waiting for you to share your understanding of the Wednesday lesson with me.
28/12/23, 16:26 - Praise EWYL23E0453: 1. Wednesday lesson
I understood that as we stand on the threshold of a new year, the air is filled with a sense of hope, possibilities and chance for a fresh start as it is a perfect time to reflect on the past and set a stage for a brighter future. One powerful tool to guide us in the journey is goal settining and having a growth mindset. Growth mindset centers on the belief that intelligence and  abilities can be attained through dedication, hardwork and perseverance. A growth mindset allows us to accept change and learn from failure. Goal setting serves as a compass for personal and professional journeys providing direction for purpose. 

The roles of goal setting
- enhancing learning and skill development
- cultivating resilience in face of challenges
- promoting a healthy work-life balance
- foster meaningful relationships
- promoting innovation and creativity
28/12/23, 16:36 - Saloni Rastogi: Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the Wednesday lesson. Your understanding of the new year as a time filled with hope, possibilities, and the chance for a fresh start is insightful. The emphasis on reflection, goal setting, and adopting a growth mindset as powerful tools for guiding us in the journey ahead is well-articulated.
Highlighting the roles of goal setting in enhancing learning and skill development, cultivating resilience in the face of challenges, promoting a healthy work-life balance, fostering meaningful relationships, and encouraging innovation and creativity adds depth to your perspective. These aspects are indeed crucial for personal and professional growth.
28/12/23, 16:37 - Praise EWYL23E0453: Thank you very much
28/12/23, 16:51 - Saloni Rastogi: Starting from the new year, we are embarking on a new phase to enhance project performance. As the first project is currently on hold due to internal development, our attention will be dedicated to the Community Building Project and the African School Project.
We will be working diligently on these initiatives because, in just a few days, you will be only a few months behind your intake. Our primary focus will shift towards achieving a financial milestone of earning $1000-2000 before that deadline. Are you on board for this journey?
28/12/23, 17:09 - Praise EWYL23E0453: Yes l am
29/12/23, 16:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings on this beautiful day!✨

As we embark on a new year, it's the perfect time to reflect on our aspirations and set goals for personal and academic growth. To kick off our Saturday activity, we invite you to share the goals you've set for yourself in the upcoming year, 2024.🎯

Let's make 2024 a year of growth, achievement, and mutual support. We look forward to hearing about your aspirations during our Saturday activity.🤝

Participating actively in student events is a valuable investment in both personal and professional growth as these experiences offer unique opportunities for students to enhance their skills and gain insight from industry leaders as well as foster a holistic development that goes beyond classroom learning.
