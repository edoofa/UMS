08/12/23, 13:02 - Unknown: Good morning, Dylan
As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"
Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."
08/12/23, 13:04 - Dylan EWYL22E0993: Morning ma’am
08/12/23, 13:10 - Unknown: Now, the riddle's answer is an echo. Just like an echo, our actions reverberate in the world, shaping the narrative of our lives. Steve Jobs' quote underscores the importance of finding passion and purpose in our endeavors. It's not just about going through the motions; it's about doing work that resonates with your inner self.

For you, remarkable young students, this is the time to explore, to discover what makes your heartbeat faster. Your journey is not just about grades and achievements; it's about finding the echoes of your passion and letting them guide you toward a future filled with great work.

So, let's dive into today's session with enthusiasm and curiosity, ready to uncover the echoes that will shape your extraordinary journey.
08/12/23, 13:17 - Dylan EWYL22E0993: Very motivational
08/12/23, 13:18 - Unknown: Yes, it is.

08/12/23, 13:26 - Dylan EWYL22E0993: **
