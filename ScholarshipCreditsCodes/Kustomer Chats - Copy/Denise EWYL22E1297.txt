17/03/23, 19:04 - Denise EWYL22E1297: Good morning. I'll do that as soon as I get back on WiFi connection. I'm currently using mobile data.
17/03/23, 20:13 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Denise!
How are you?
17/03/23, 20:14 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
17/03/23, 20:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
17/03/23, 20:15 - Saloni Rastogi: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
17/03/23, 20:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
17/03/23, 20:27 - Denise EWYL22E1297: Yes, I am ready for this
17/03/23, 20:28 - Denise EWYL22E1297: I am well and you?
17/03/23, 21:38 - Saloni Rastogi: I am ready to see this.
17/03/23, 21:39 - Saloni Rastogi: This excitement and this enthusiasm is amazing.
17/03/23, 21:39 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know on which project will you work on in the month of March?
17/03/23, 22:06 - Denise EWYL22E1297: The project that I'd like to work on is the Community Building project.
17/03/23, 22:31 - Saloni Rastogi: That's great!
17/03/23, 22:32 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know what is your understanding so far on the project and how do you think we can work on it?
17/03/23, 22:36 - Denise EWYL22E1297: I have understood that the second project is about community building and involves reaching out to friends, siblings and other potential students for Edoofa who have completed their high school, have recently written exams and are academically inclined. It entails reaching out to them and giving them application forms, only 10 applicants can be accepted per week as the Edoofa Program usually gets up to 1200 applications per week. After this, the Edoofian will be able to give insight to the new applicants about what Edoofa is,my experience with Edoofa and what the EWYL Program is. This project is about community building.
17/03/23, 22:37 - Denise EWYL22E1297: The best approach I think would be to reach out to my friends, cousins, relatives, neighbors and even going to school to introduce scholars to the Edoofa Program.

Ms Saloni said I can start by creating a Whatsapp group and spread the link.
17/03/23, 22:52 - Denise EWYL22E1297: I've already begun reaching out to students and former students
18/03/23, 04:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's continue tomorrow for the weekend activity and our discussion.​
​You know I learned something new today, that is I need to make full use of all the opportunities offered to us and value them.​
​ I also wish the same for you, that you explore the EWYL Program and its amazing opportunities like the projects and continuous learning.
So, think about it and plan tomorrow accordingly.
Till then, have great day?
18/03/23, 06:56 - Denise EWYL22E1297: Until tomorrow, good day.
18/03/23, 20:06 - Denise EWYL22E1297: Good morning. I am a proud Edoofian.

18/03/23, 20:11 - Denise EWYL22E1297: Very insightful. It's true, the only one that can hold me back from achieving my goals or chasing my dreams is me.
18/03/23, 20:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings *my proud edoofian*!

Here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!
18/03/23, 20:44 - Saloni Rastogi: You have said all correct about the community building project.
18/03/23, 20:45 - Saloni Rastogi: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
18/03/23, 20:45 - Saloni Rastogi: A] Through WhatsApp community groups:


STEP 1: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME\/MENTOR NAME\/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED
For eg: In your case it will be-
Denise\/SaloniE\/18MAR2023
18/03/23, 20:46 - Saloni Rastogi: STEP 2: We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
18/03/23, 20:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
18/03/23, 20:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
18/03/23, 20:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Do let me know in case of any concerns.
18/03/23, 20:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Add me also once you create the group.
18/03/23, 20:50 - Denise EWYL22E1297: I'm not really understanding this concept of divisions. Is this still one group or I'll have to create many groups?
18/03/23, 20:50 - Denise EWYL22E1297: Also, when is the Saturday task due?
18/03/23, 20:51 - Saloni Rastogi: Divisions are basically different classes within your Form 6
18/03/23, 20:52 - Denise EWYL22E1297: Alright, I now understand. But I'll be creating just one group, isn't it?
18/03/23, 20:52 - Saloni Rastogi: You Saturday activity is due for Monday in your session from 11:30-02:30 PM.
18/03/23, 20:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, just one group.
18/03/23, 20:52 - Denise EWYL22E1297: Alright.
18/03/23, 20:53 - Denise EWYL22E1297: Do I have to talk to the applicants first before I add them to the group.
20/03/23, 01:29 - Denise EWYL22E1297: Good day, I am a proud Edoofian!
20/03/23, 01:45 - Denise EWYL22E1297: For the Saturday task;

My personal values, I'd say, include integrity, loyalty, honesty, kindness, tolerance, self control, forbearance and patience.

I believe each and everyone of these traits will help mold me into someone that most people would look up to. I'd like to be Inspiration to many people of all ages, not because of great wealth or success but because of good character.

Integrity will help me to be the person I am, even when no one is watching. That means people will be able to rely on me, and they'll have confidence in collaborating with me. Honesty is the best policy; I believe that honesty is of paramount importance and without it, there will be no way for me to touch the lives of others.

Loyalty means I'll stick by my world, or the people who count on me no matter what. I want to be such a person that when people are in trouble, the first people they will think of contacting is me.

Kindness really is putting the needs of others above my own. It is important to do so because I believe that in this life time, we were called to serve others. 

Tolerance would allow me to sympathise with others and accept that some people will have views that differ from mine. We may not always see eye to eye but I should be willing to respect that and respect them. 

Forbearance in other words, is endurance. Everything good in this life time take a while to achieve. Forbearance works hand in hand with patience and self control. If I work hard, trust the process l, endure the struggles along the way, refrain from testing dangerous limits and don't stray from my moral values, I'll truly be able to achieve anything in this life time.

What I want most in life is to leave a legacy, to be remembered for doing good by God, by my family, by people and lastly, doing good by me.
20/03/23, 01:48 - Denise EWYL22E1297: My mission statement would be : *Grace under pressure; Success after the struggle*.

This will help me remember that if I remain rooted in all the good values I've been taught, and I don't crumble under the pressure of my dreams, goals or life, the end result will undoubtedly be success, with an inspiring story behind it.
20/03/23, 16:21 - Denise EWYL22E1297: Good morning. I am a proud Edoofian.
20/03/23, 16:25 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”
20/03/23, 20:09 - Denise EWYL22E1297: Please may I be excused from today's session. There is no network here today thus it will be difficult to get anything done.
20/03/23, 20:09 - Denise EWYL22E1297: I'm very sorry for the inconvenience.
20/03/23, 20:37 - Denise EWYL22E1297: Network is now working well. I'll be available for the session today.
20/03/23, 22:10 - Denise EWYL22E1297: Good afternoon. Are we still having our session today?

20/03/23, 23:04 - Denise EWYL22E1297: I made the group and I'm trying to circulate the link.
20/03/23, 23:36 - Saloni Rastogi: Denise, no worries.
Fortunately, the session got pushed today due to my meetings with the team.
20/03/23, 23:38 - Saloni Rastogi: You know I am deeply inspired by the missions that you have shared with me.
I was stuck at the point where you mentioned that you don't want to crumble under the pressure of your dreams , I am sure that you will leave an inspiring story for everyone to know about.
Along with this, in every response, I like to enlighten my students on how I feel about the lesson\/activity and how smoothly it connects with them.
For this one also, I would firstly say that my biggest mission is to provide a happy life for my mother who has done so much for me in the past so many years.
And the second goal, that I believe is driving me every day to work hard is the curiosity to meet my students at the airport and see them earning at least $100 of scholarship credits every month so that they become so independent that can pay their own fees.
20/03/23, 23:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, I have joined the group.
As discussed, may I know how are you planning to increase the number of participants because currently there are just two members, you and me?
21/03/23, 00:06 - Denise EWYL22E1297: Yes, your goals are very inspiring! I hope for the same, to make my mother proud as well.
21/03/23, 00:07 - Denise EWYL22E1297: So far, I'm approaching those who have completed A Level through my friends and neighbors. I've already talked to three people and shared the link with them, but they are yet to join. They seem interested so far.

I am pleased to observe that a majority of you comprehended well, the message  that was conveyed in this week's Wednesday wisdom. It brought me great joy to go through student’s perspectives on wealth creation and the mindset essential for embarking on this path.

I have a special Saturday assignment for you. The objective of this assignment is to help you understand the steps you can take to prepare yourself for wealth creation. The assignment will encourage you to identify their goals, develop a financial plan, and cultivate the mindset and habits needed to achieve financial success.

Here are some instructions to make it easy for you to work on this assignment:
1. Goal Setting: The first step towards wealth creation is to set clear and achievable goals. In this section, write down your short-term and long-term financial goals. Explain how each goal will contribute to your overall financial success.
2. Financial Planning: A financial plan is a roadmap that outlines how you will achieve your financial goals. In this section, develop a comprehensive financial plan that includes strategies for budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management. Identify the resources you will need to achieve your financial plan and explain how you will access them.
3. Mindset and Habits: Wealth creation is not just about having a financial plan; it is also about cultivating the mindset and habits that will help you achieve your goals. In this section, identify the mindset and habits that are necessary for financial success. Explain how you will cultivate these qualities in yourself and develop strategies to overcome any obstacles that may arise.
4. Conclusion: In this section, summarize your findings and discuss the importance of preparing yourself for wealth creation. Reflect on what you have learned throughout the assignment and discuss how you will apply these principles in your own life.
