09/12/23, 20:28 - Aditi Kapoor: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

11/12/23, 20:10 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Tadiwanashe!
Hope you are well.


No worries! I can guide you through the process of creating columns and adding headers in Excel. Here's a step-by-step guide:
Open Excel:Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer.

Create Columns:Click on the letter at the top of a column (e.g., A, B, C) to select the entire column.
Right-click on the selected column letter.
Choose "Insert" from the context menu.
This action will insert a new column to the left of the selected column.

Repeat for More Columns:If you need more columns, repeat the process by selecting and inserting as many columns as required.

Add Headers:Click on the cell where you want the header to be (usually the first row).
Type in the header text (e.g., Name, Age, Date, etc.).
Press Enter to confirm.

Format Headers:You can format headers by making the text bold, changing the font size, or adjusting the alignment. Highlight the header text, right-click, and choose formatting options.

Autofill Headers:If you have a series of headers (e.g., Year, Month, Day), you can use the autofill handle at the bottom right corner of the selected cell to fill in the sequence.

Remember, these steps may slightly vary depending on your version of Excel, but they should provide a general guideline. If you encounter any issues or have specific questions, feel free to ask!
11/12/23, 20:11 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0943: Good evening ma'am, l am using "spreadsheet"

13/12/23, 17:08 - Aditi Kapoor: *Happy Wednesday*🌻

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
Team EWYL
