It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

a)Target- no. of credits you want to earn in the month of October
b)How many projects can you work upon
c)Number of hours that you can devote to your projects
d)Name of the projects that you want to be a part of
e)Plan of action with your mentors

You are required to submit these answers by Today 6 PM. Let me know in case you face any challenges in Submitting the responses.

Happy Learning!

07/10/22, 17:47 - Unknown: Greetings, Proud Edoofian 
I hope that you are doing well
07/10/22, 17:47 - Unknown: Let me help you with this
07/10/22, 17:48 - Unknown: Once you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to him in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering professional communication, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized. 
The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career years.
07/10/22, 17:48 - Unknown: So, This is what the First message should look like:
07/10/22, 17:48 - Unknown: Greetings Mr.\/Mrs *School Head Name*

I am *Your Name* and I am a student of _Your School Name_ school.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result\/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
07/10/22, 17:51 - Natasha EWYL22E0024: Noted sir thank you for the help
07/10/22, 21:01 - Unknown: Once He\/She confirms the timings with you, Please make sure that you reach out to the School Head 5 min before the scheduled timings. After that, you can start sharing the information regarding Edoofa with him\/her.
This is what the Introduction will look like:
07/10/22, 21:01 - Unknown: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education   All. 

Edoofa is a social for-profit organization that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!
07/10/22, 21:02 - Unknown: Sir,\/Mam, Do you know that ABC School (I will be providing you with the name of this school) which is in our province is a proud partner of Edoofa?
07/10/22, 21:02 - Unknown: Over the past 2 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his\/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as a company wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. With the quality of education provided to the student completing high school, edoofa would want to transform your school’s every student into a person who’s so strong in the knowledge that he\/she becomes better than her peers. Coupled with the Earn While you Learn program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he\/she has got more opportunities to chase him\/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development\/growth.
07/10/22, 21:06 - Natasha EWYL22E0024: Noted
07/10/22, 21:46 - Unknown: By Sharing the above information, We have completed the Introduction part. Now, It is time to explain with examples How Edoofa is revolutionizing the Education System on the African Continent. Examples create clarity. This is why they are used in all contexts as a tool to provide further understanding. When it comes to your conversation, examples play a significant role in your ability to effectively communicate the elements that you want the School Head to understand.
07/10/22, 21:46 - Unknown: Sir\/ Mam, I would like to share some examples regarding How Edoofa is revolutionizing the Education System in the African Continent.

Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *90 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

Their associate partner, *Mr. Shorwi Kawadza*is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of *Hartzell High School*. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with them for the past *Four Years* from which more than _80 students_ have enrolled and arrived in India already.

I wish you a blessed and a joyful weekend ahead✨
18/07/22, 18:19 - Natasha EWYL22E0024: Good morning Mr Rithvik
18/07/22, 18:19 - Natasha EWYL22E0024: I'm a proud edoofian
18/07/22, 18:20 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off
