10/07/23, 12:39 - Panashe EWYL23E0277: On the 16th of January 1974 a legend was born, today I live calling him as my father and to tell the truth I am proud to be called his son. Since I can remember he has always and will still always be my inspiration. Back at his early‚Äôs he lived in a rural area called Madziva in Zimbabwe, he lived in a family of nine. My father did his primary and secondary level and he had to walk nearly 14 kilometers to and from school, and after school they would have to go with their herd  in the bushes for them to graze but what inspired me the most is his capability to thrive through with his education though they had a poor education system and them having to walk without shoes to school on daily basis at times they would go without food to eat during their breakfast and lunch but with all those difficulties he managed to pass his examinations though he failed many times he still kept on trying he did it and got a job and with that job we are earning a living. Besides the ups and downs he had he kept on thriving to what I can say is his potential. Despite all the challenges he face up to now he conquers them and he is able to cater the three of us our rights for education that is why I am inspired to take over the button as I am the first son in the family it is now in my hands to learn and work hard that I am able to lift my family since he is now old and about to retire.He has been my inspiration fo as long as I can remember.

11/07/23, 13:57 - Saloni Rastogi: ‚ñ™Ô∏èWith consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success 
  ‚ñ™Ô∏èVisiting schools physically can put a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
  ‚ñ™Ô∏èWith this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, leadership quality, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear to present himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.
11/07/23, 14:04 - Panashe EWYL23E0277: Yah this way for sure one can be trusted because through WhatsApp they might think it‚Äôs a scam .

19/07/23, 13:04 - Panashe EWYL23E0277: Hello Friends
I am Panashe Vincent a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is *ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 p*er term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5‚ÄôS which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5‚ÄôS of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
