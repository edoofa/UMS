12/12/23, 15:50 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
12/12/23, 15:51 - Delight EWYL23E0697: OK it's a pleasure to hear that. I m really happy to connect with you again
12/12/23, 15:58 - Ananya: Great, now, to begin with, I want to understand which one is your favorite project: community building or the African school reform mission projects?
12/12/23, 15:59 - Delight EWYL23E0697: African school reform mission is my favorite
12/12/23, 16:03 - Ananya: That's great! So tell me about your progress so far in your favorite project!
12/12/23, 16:07 - Delight EWYL23E0697: I have contacted my school principal and he said he need to figure out and update me on the date of connecting with you

I also contacted the one from another school and he said he is at ZIMSEC for marking since recently they were national examinations here in Zimbabwe. He promised to connect with you as soon as he is back from marking
12/12/23, 16:14 - Ananya: Alright, Delight! May I know if you have friends from another school?
12/12/23, 16:16 - Delight EWYL23E0697: Yes of course i do have a few friends
12/12/23, 16:24 - Ananya: So, why don;t you ask them for your their school heads' contact number?
12/12/23, 16:27 - Delight EWYL23E0697: I already asked them and i am also working on enrolling them too into the Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/12/23, 16:32 - Ananya: Great! I assume you already know that every school class has an informal WhatsApp group.

You can request to be added to the group and share information. Additionally, you can share the group's WhatsApp link and invite others who might be interested in joining. You can also add me to the group, and I can assist you in engaging the students.
12/12/23, 16:34 - Delight EWYL23E0697: That's a good move Ms Ananya. Mostly when people from Zimbabwe sees this and they find out that it's a Zimbabwean number. They think that it's a scam. Since you have said so that will be wonderful. I will build another community and delete the current one and add you as well
12/12/23, 16:37 - Ananya: No, you do not have to delete the other one!
12/12/23, 16:37 - Ananya: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
12/12/23, 16:37 - Ananya: *Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
12/12/23, 16:37 - Delight EWYL23E0697: OK mam
12/12/23, 16:40 - Delight EWYL23E0697: Noted

Thank you mam. I m sure this will be more effective so I will work this way
12/12/23, 16:44 - Ananya: So, for the people who do not trust us, you can opt for the following things:
Share our weekly newsletter with them, where they can see the Edoofa Hall of Fame.
Share your university offer letter with them.
You can also share our Edoofa Instagram page.
Additionally, did you know that the First Lady of Zimbabwe took time during her visit to India to meet the CEO of Edoofa? How can this be a fraud?

We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work ‚Äì a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.üåü

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

14/12/23, 16:47 - Delight EWYL23E0697: Hello. I have a question. Cam a person study in India for Alevel under Edoofa Scholarship Program
15/12/23, 15:38 - Ananya: Good afternoon, Delight!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!
Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!üçìü´ê
15/12/23, 15:41 - Delight EWYL23E0697: Afternoon how are you. I hope that you are doing well. It's a pleasure to connect with you again. I m really happy to hear that. We can move forward
15/12/23, 15:43 - Ananya: I read your question, Delight. So, we provide scholarships for higher education only.
15/12/23, 15:45 - Delight EWYL23E0697: OK thank you so much. The Headmaster of Fatima ZIMFEP High School was looking forward to connect with you yesterday

15/12/23, 15:53 - Delight EWYL23E0697: Yes of course i did
15/12/23, 15:54 - Ananya: So did he fill out the form?
15/12/23, 15:57 - Delight EWYL23E0697: He hasn't filled it yet. In terms of you connecting with him do I add him in my EWYL program group
15/12/23, 16:06 - Ananya: Well, Delight, in order to schedule a meeting with our program director, I have to know the details of the school; therefore, it is crucial to fill out the form.
15/12/23, 16:12 - Delight EWYL23E0697: OK it's fine. I will have to wait for the form to be filled they you will be probably connecting tomorrow around 5pm
15/12/23, 16:15 - Ananya: Alright, So, to begin with, may I inquire if you had the chance to review your Wednesday lesson?
15/12/23, 16:23 - Delight EWYL23E0697: Yes of course i reviewed it. I got the chance to
15/12/23, 16:28 - Ananya: That's great! What did you learn from it? I am quite excited to know your thoughts on the lesson!

On hardworking i learnt about hard working which is  continuous learning as well as further studies and individual research practice
15/12/23, 16:48 - Delight EWYL23E0697: Apologies Ms Ananya.üôè Network is not doing justice this side
15/12/23, 16:56 - Delight EWYL23E0697: I will soon be sharing the filled up form with you. Not knowing whether you will get time to review it
15/12/23, 17:00 - Ananya: Well, that's great! By the way, I understand that we couldn't have a fruitful session today, but I would still suggest working hard on your projects by utilizing the weekends. Set a small target for yourself, like 3-4 forms over the weekend, and work hard to achieve it.

Remember, I am saying this with experience; the credits you can earn now will be helpful throughout your journey, and for that, I am determined to keep your spirits high and push you to the fullest! Now, let's connect on Tuesday. Meanwhile, do not forget to follow your EWYL ritual daily to receive the activity.
