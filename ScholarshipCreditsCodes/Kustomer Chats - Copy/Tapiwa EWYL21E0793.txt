25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:34 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
13/10/22, 22:05 - Tapiwa EWYL21E0793: I am a proud Edoofian
13/10/22, 22:06 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

14/10/22, 23:18 - Unknown: Yes
14/10/22, 23:18 - Unknown: Edoofian, I have another strategy for you for *COMMUNITY BUILDING*

You can approach 1 student , ask for his\/her time [ when he\/she will be available to have a conversation ]

After that you can pitch edoofa and use the edoofa FAQ 


Once you are over with that conversation , you can ask the student to add you in his\/her *school unofficial group* and then counsel them all together.

You can send the form in that group and ask the students to fill it.
Once you get the forms you can submit them to me.

If you want any help with the communication, I can help you with that
14/10/22, 23:23 - Tapiwa EWYL21E0793: Okay l can do that and yes please the communication will be important since student believe if they have proof of the person who is part of the scholarship that is you or anyone else from the edoofa program to tell more
15/10/22, 17:27 - Unknown: Happy weekend!
Hope you have a great one ahead!
15/10/22, 17:31 - Unknown: You can first use this document

15/10/22, 18:02 - Tapiwa EWYL21E0793: Okay l will look into it
15/10/22, 18:42 - Unknown: Yes, 
You can use messages such as
15/10/22, 18:42 - Unknown: Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. They are associated with more than 90 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA.

Below is your weekend task!

I will take an update on Monday *10 AM*
Hello my dear Edoofians
Hope you are doing well. This week we learned about one of the most popular yet grounded people who used social media as a tool to become an educator and give back to the community and still become an entrepreneur.
This week I want you to reflect on what your strengths and skills are to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 

These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content etc.
Please share these skills and instances where you were able to showcase these skills on Monday
Till then 
Happy Learning!

18/10/22, 20:03 - Unknown: Today let us Understand and explain the true meaning of exams
It is easy to misunderstand why we take exams.
The purpose of exams is to allow us to understand what we have not understood so far – so that we can learn it again.
The purpose of exams is not – to show someone else (the teacher) how much we know- but to realize how much we know and what we don’t.
18/10/22, 20:06 - Tapiwa EWYL21E0793: Yes maam l understand that's true
18/10/22, 20:08 - Unknown: Unfortunately, however, since exams are usually such a public affair – it is best to encourage children to test themselves on their knowledge before they go for the exam.
Encourage yourself to solve all the questions given at the end of the chapter
Arrange for your timetable  to solve all the available question papers
18/10/22, 20:18 - Tapiwa EWYL21E0793: Okay ma'am l will be

Do you agree with my points or you have a different approach?
18/10/22, 20:55 - Tapiwa EWYL21E0793: I think your right to have a timetable to solve available question papers
18/10/22, 21:11 - Unknown: yes
