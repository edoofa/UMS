01/10/22, 17:21 - Jasmine Kaur: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

So we know, a lot of you have been keeping busy these days with your exams and academic curriculum. And while we wish you all the luck for it, we don't want you to miss out on your learning and skill building. In today's lesson, we will discuss how to build our capacity to multitask, manage our time and prioritize our daily tasks in order to have it all. 

Let's dig right in, and understand how if you follow these steps, you will be able to manage your exams, assignments, extra curriculars, and your EWYL projects all at one go. After going through this, you must discuss the plan of action to execute these steps with your mentors.

Happy Learning!

07/10/22, 19:01 - Jasmine Kaur: *Check this out, this is the response I received by one of my students and I am expecting the same out of you*


What I have learnt so far is that there are steps that will help me in managing my exams, assignment, extracurricular and ewyl projects at one go.the first step is to set a vision and it gives me a mind of finding a practical use for my time efficiently.always remembering the bigger picture and spending time on things that move closer to my vision. Secondly is to create a masterlist daily where I will be listing tasks to be done on that particular day and it gives me a picture of what my day is going to look like and remembering all that needed to be done. Thirdly is to find my productive cycle by finding the time of the day when I have a huge amount of focus and energy and start executing the most important task . Lastly is leveraging people, I have to delegate my tasks and make best use of resources available and it helps me increase my work efficiency. I have to believe in others vision and support them to interchange and help me

08/10/22, 04:49 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0248: I have learnt about  skills that will help me use my time productively , efficiently (henceforth helps me manage my co-curricular  ,extracurricular activities  including the EWYL projects).The first skill set is setting a vision. This helps me bear in mind on how Iam supposed to consume time wisely, productively and  efficiently thereby making me get closer to my vision. The second skill set is creating a master list daily. This is a list on how I will spend my time. It acts as a remembrance of usefull tasks that Iam supposed to accomplish at a particular time. Third skill is use of Productive Cycle. Here Iam supposed to take note of time of the day when I will be having a huge amount of focus and energy and start executing the most important task. Last but not least, delegating my tasks and making use of available resources helps me to increase my work efficiency.

You can approach 1 student , ask for his\/her time [ when he\/she will be available to have a conversation ]

After that you can pitch edoofa and use the edoofa FAQ 


Once you are over with that conversation , you can ask the student to add you in his\/her school unofficial group and then counsel them all together.

15/07/22, 23:56 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"


Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these at

16/07/22, 17:38 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, how are you doing?
Today I wanted to discuss the recent message I shared with you. The message that we want to be our daily habit, our words of connecting and experiencing a sense of belonging, We all at team Edoofa are very thrilled as we personally are undertaking the same activity. May I know what have you understood from this message, what is the intention behind the same?

19/07/22, 21:34 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0248: Approximately 60% of Zimbabwe's land comprises of ancient rocks reowned worldwide for containing rich varieties of mineral resources including gold, base minerals (copper, zinc and lead) and industrial minerals ( limestone, phosphates, clay and dolomite).The mining industry is largely governed by the Mines and Minerals Act although it is subject to other business in Zimbabwe. The mining industry falls under ministry of mines. Other laws include:
1)Mineral Marketing Cooperation of Zimbabwe Act
2)Gold Trade Act
3)Precious Stones Trade Act
4)Base Minerals Export Act
The Chamber of mines of Zimbabwe ( established by an Act of Parliament) is the dominant representative body of the mining industry in Zimbabwe. The Mines and Minerals Act also establishes the mining affairs board which oversees the administration of the mines and minerals act from an administration perspective. The Zimbabwe Mining Development Cooperation (a parastatal)is the government body responsible for mining  and mining development.
Key mineral resources:
-Diamonds
-Gold
-Platinum
-Coal
-Chrome
-Iron ore
The 2022 national budget by the minister of finance, Professor Mthuli Ncube ,they allocated ZWL$3 billion to finance the amendment of the mines and minerals Act ,operationalism of the mining cadastre system, decentralization of operations , opening of closed mines , hiring , and capacitating mining extension officers , mineral value addition and beneficiation. Vote of to Ministry of mines shows commitment by the government. President's development mantra \" Zimbabwe is open for Zimbabwe\" shows commitment. Efforts by the government through ministry of mines to formalise the informal sector. Policies have been placed like reposition of under utilized mines. Also efficiency of those with claims monitored by Fidelity on gold production. Several agreements are being done by the government and mining companies ( development partners like China) from the developed world to have mines

It actually taught me a lesson that *Blaming others does not yield any fruitful outcome.*

21/07/22, 19:21 - Unknown: What are your learnings from the same?
21/07/22, 21:06 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0248: Placing blame on somewhere else lead to dissatisfaction and failure. Inventing excuses on why one can't succeed convinces one that failure is irresistible . In order  to succeed we need not to blame the world when we fail , instead we have to accept personal responsibility , learn from our mistakes and do something about it.

Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!
