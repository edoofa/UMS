13/07/22, 21:46 - Makanaka EWYL22E0215: One has to have a lot of outstanding skills in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits. Firstly one has to have critical thinking. With critical thinking, your thinking abilities are not limited and you tend to think outside the box. With critical thinking you are someone who has deep thinking into things and your opinions over how something should be done rule over others. Secondly, one should have good time management. When you are able to manage your time well you become capable of finishing your projects in time even when you are given a certain deadline. Thirdly, one should be a problem solver with some great problem solving skills. With this, you a re able to tackle anything you are given to do and you should be someone who is quick to engage into the problems around the project making sure to solve them straight away. Lastly, one should also have good communication skills. When you are doing a project or any work somehow you are going to seek for the assistance of others or if not, you will be working with others sometimes. Good communication skills are needed for better communication and understanding and for a peaceful environment for you to work on your project. They as well say, where there is peace, there is prosperity!

Happy New Week, my proud Edoofian! How was your weekend?
18/07/22, 19:28 - Unknown: Good to see that you have been following the ritual, Makanaka. keep it up!
18/07/22, 19:28 - Unknown: Did you work on the  very interesting Weekend activity? 

I personally enjoyed learning about SWOT analysis and implementing it for my self. I hope you did too.
18/07/22, 21:54 - Makanaka EWYL22E0215: Sorry for the late response
18/07/22, 21:54 - Makanaka EWYL22E0215: In Zimbabwe, as much as we would like to believe that beauty is skin deep, it is inevitable that in the last 3 to 4 years beauty industry has grown immensely. There  new and various ways ways of making women feel beautiful.The lost is endless ranging from wigs, braids, eyeshadow pallets, lip glosses, lashes, concealers i could go on an on not forgetting the numerous ways one can have their nails done.

 The beauty Industry has been fast growing cause everwhere you turn the nearest saloon is only a step away. I can not begin to mention the number of Avon agents I know personally as friends and family. There are various options to chose from including the new Fenti shop I am yet to check out. 

The strength of these business is that more youths are being trained for beauty courses at Community innovation hubs so the beauty salons always have enough manpower to handle any number of customers. It is very accessible to anyone who is interested as the government has had a huge hand to play in financing such enterprises which could also be its biggest weakness as these funds are limited and will depend on the owner in order for the business to grow making it its biggest weakness apart from the fact that there is competition everywhrre and the likeness of these business to expand is slim to none but yet still very dominant.
 Opportunities have risen from the numbers of youths inspired to do the same.This ensures that the business is still very much leaning into our future and provides security to the business owners.

 The business are in aim of supporting each other but is most commonly viewed as a threat because of the overwhelming competition around making them malfunctional as they would bearly live up to their margings in terms of profit. This is because each salon will have to prove itself and this means more money will be spent on advertisements. In the end all is fair in this industry and in my point would be the fastest growing industry in Zimbabw
18/07/22, 23:06 - Unknown: Amazing to read your response for the weekend activity. I like how you chose this particular industry and how you have explained about it's growth in the time to come.

25/07/22, 16:06 - Makanaka EWYL22E0215: Good morning Sir

25/07/22, 16:07 - Makanaka EWYL22E0215: *I am a proud Edoofian!!!*
25/07/22, 16:07 - Makanaka EWYL22E0215: Successful people don't easily blame others for their mistakes or failures. Why? This is because already they would have worked hard to get where they want for them to be called successful. They would have fallen, risen, tripled, staggered, walked straight up again, frowned, smiled the next minute. It all comes from the mind. They know they very much want to reach a certain goal so they are never disturbed or intimidated by the odds. I think for one to be successful you need to have a sharp mindset. By sharp mindset I mean you have to be focused on the goal you need to reach. Great people always say 'Press on towards your goal' . If one does so and remains in the lane, you never go wrong. Even if some mistakes or failures come along your way you are never moved because even if you fall, you know are still pressing towards your goal. I also think that for one to develop a successful mindset which accepts failure, you got to know how to work well with people. They are always there if we want some advice and we never know when they will be useful so pride aside no matter how successful you are! Because they are the same people who are going to stand with you the times you fail.
