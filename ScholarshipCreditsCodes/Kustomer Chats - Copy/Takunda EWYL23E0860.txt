Let's kick off our session with a fascinating scientific fact:
The Eiffel Tower can actually be 15 cm taller during the summer. This happens because the iron expands in the heat and contracts in the winter, causing the height variation.ðŸ¤¯ðŸ—¼
28/11/23, 15:50 - Takunda EWYL23E0860: Thank you madam
28/11/23, 15:51 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.

28/11/23, 15:56 - Ananya: So, Takunda, to begin with, I believe that we should begin with something that aligns with your interest. SO tell me which is your favorite project? Community building or the school project?
28/11/23, 15:57 - Takunda EWYL23E0860: The school project
28/11/23, 16:00 - Ananya: Great, so to begin with can I ask about your progress in the project?
28/11/23, 16:11 - Takunda EWYL23E0860: Yah... Looking for other nearby schools.. The current ones that I visited need me to bring a permit from the education office in Gwanda
28/11/23, 16:12 - Ananya: Alright, so did you try to find other schools?
28/11/23, 16:13 - Takunda EWYL23E0860: Yeah
