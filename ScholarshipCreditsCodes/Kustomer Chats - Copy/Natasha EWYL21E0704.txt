20/07/22, 17:46 - Unknown: Greetings Natasha!
How did your day go?
20/07/22, 17:50 - Unknown: So I am so excited to welcome you again here. Hope we will have active discussions from now on.
21/07/22, 02:08 - Natasha EWYL21E0704: Good day ma'am.
21/07/22, 02:08 - Natasha EWYL21E0704: I'm a proud Edoofian
21/07/22, 02:09 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

23/07/22, 08:59 - Natasha EWYL21E0704: Ok ma'am
23/07/22, 23:52 - Unknown: Greetings Natasha!
I am waiting to discuss your understanding on the Wednesday wisdom, I hope you are finished reading it.
24/07/22, 04:24 - Unknown: Greetings Natasha!
Please share your response to the Wednesday wisdom here.
Also, I see you have forgotten the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' on the EWYL Line.
Please do that without reminders.

There is    a lot of things that influence our results but we do not have to be set back by those factors because as individuals we have dominion over our lives.

25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

26/07/22, 20:23 - Unknown: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

Yesterday I had an amazing day. I went to the airport to receive all my proud Edoofians and I had tears in my eyes seeing their happiness and enthusiasm. I want you to look at it and share your thoughts with me.
26/07/22, 20:30 - Unknown: I read your response, Natasha, to the Wednesday wisdom and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
27/07/22, 05:43 - Unknown: Did you look at the pictures Natasha?
Please share what do you think about them.
27/07/22, 06:20 - Natasha EWYL21E0704: It clearly shows that the Edoofa community is very large and as is, it seeks to groom more self esteemed and confident individuals who are bound to become game changers in the near future.
27/07/22, 21:51 - Unknown: Yes Natasha, very TRUE.
27/07/22, 21:52 - Unknown: Also Natasha, please share your response to the weekend activity. I am so excited to discuss them with you.
28/07/22, 03:45 - Natasha EWYL21E0704: I haven't received the activity, I highlighted the same on Sunday

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:34 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

16/11/22, 22:41 - Unknown: Before we begin, let's regain some clarity.
1) You have to follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' DAILY on the EWYL Line.
2) You have to share the responses to all activities and lessons with me on the EWYL Line only.
3) you have to choose one project on which you will put all your focus and share the name of the project with me and of course, I will guide you throughout.
16/11/22, 22:41 - Unknown: I am doing well, thanks for asking.
16/11/22, 22:43 - Unknown: Let us begin from today.
16/11/22, 22:43 - Unknown: I am sharing Wednesday lesson with you, please go through it and in case you have any doubt, do let me know.
16/11/22, 22:43 - Unknown: Hello, my dear proud Edoofian. I hope all is well with you.

Another insightful Wednesday Wisdom is presented here. The lesson today teaches us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, disability. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition. A few questions near the end of the session will ask you to reflect and have an open dialogue with yourself. After you finish your lesson, as your mentor, I'd like to have a thorough conversation about your key take aways, in our upcoming sessions.

Enjoy the article and keep in mind that success does not come to you suddenly; rather, it can be attained over time by making modest, daily improvements.

Happy learning!
16/11/22, 22:46 - Unknown: I know we have both been connected in the EWYL Journey for a long time now and I very well know how dedicatedly and consistently you work and make every session's discussion very productive and interactive.

18/11/22, 07:50 - Natasha EWYL21E0704: Reaching greater heights in life is not an easy task, rather it is a two way street which requires effort and dedication. I believe that the more I work hard the greater the height I achieve thus I wouldn't say I have reached greater heights in life but I'm working towards that.



Most of my goals haven't been achieved yet but the building blocks and the foundation has been laid such that I see a clear way of where I'm coming from and a glimpse of where I'm going..

At this point in my life I'm just grateful for what I have achieved so far. I wouldn't say I'm fulfilled because I still have the zeal to do more because my dreams depend on doing more.

How are you?

The Wednesday lesson taught us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, _disability_. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition.

In our session, we will discuss:
1) your understanding of how disability is different from what we thought about it earlier
2) progress on the projects

19/11/22, 18:48 - Natasha EWYL21E0704: Disability surely doesn't mean inability, one can still have dreams and fulfill them. Disability is not the end of life but it can be a new lease of life. Sir Eddie is one of the examples whose living with disability but he is doing the most........thus in a nutshell, it goes to show that nothing in this world is greater than your passion and dreams
