15/12/22, 18:02 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr

Let us start your session.

I have a simple riddle for you to start with:
You can see it every day, but you cannot touch it. What is it?

17/12/22, 21:18 - Jasmine Kaur: Sat Activity: 

Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often than not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Who would you prefer as your Secret Santa and what gift would you like to receive from them and why?

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!

I like to ponder a lot, and with it comes brainstorming, prototyping, and ideation techniques. How does the idea of meeting a CEO, knowing about their journey, and contemplating how success came to them sound? Interesting, right? Not yet?

Then perhaps you would like to know about how brands are developed, how they scale, how they flourish, and what goes into making a company from scratch to something of impeccable scale. In this webinar not only business ideations and strategies will be discussed but also brand development, moreover, our featured industry professional is profound in advertising, content marketing, and marketing research too. Who knows, something might catch your eye or let you discover your field of interest by just listening to the different structures of a company. I would genuinely implore you to give this a chance and see for yourself whether the seats we worth taking.

I hope you are having a good day!


I would like to know whether you attended the webinar or not and I am really curious to know whatever you have learnt through the webinar?
22/12/22, 20:12 - Dephine EWYL22E0579: I Did but unfortunately I didn't manage to finish because of network challenges
22/12/22, 20:21 - Dephine EWYL22E0579: But I did get to learn what brand ideation is. brand ideation is the creative process of generating new economic ideas. And these can be achieved through ideation techniques such as brainstorming and photocopying. Brainstorming has to with identifying problems and coming up the solutions that can be used to overcome the problems identified.
Photocopying has to do with expressing your ideas through the use of diagrams.
22/12/22, 20:24 - Dephine EWYL22E0579: Reverse brainstorming has to do with identifying ways to actually cause problems and and find solutions as this helps to generate more creative ideas
22/12/22, 20:26 - Dephine EWYL22E0579: Mind mapping gives structure to ideas in our heads and developing them into full fledged solutions
22/12/22, 20:34 - Dephine EWYL22E0579: Brand development is a strategic process of creating and distinguishing your company's image, products and services from you competitors. There are strategies for brand development. Mrs Caroline said we have to consider the overall business strategies, what the business wants to achieve. After that we identify the target clients, what do customers want she gave an example of selling children wear that's targeting the children.
22/12/22, 20:34 - Dephine EWYL22E0579: Those are some of the things that I managed to learn from Mrs Caroline
22/12/22, 21:43 - Jasmine Kaur: Oh, I think that is just great. I hope going forward as a team we are able to use whatever insights you have learned from the webinar. Th effects of reverse brainstorming and mind mapping can give structure to your business.Thankyou for sharing your understanding
22/12/22, 21:48 - Dephine EWYL22E0579: ok ma'am i am looking forward  to working with you well and applying the  things that i learnt
22/12/22, 22:02 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, with this I remember.
Can you give me the updates on the Wednesday lesson?
22/12/22, 22:32 - Dephine EWYL22E0579: It was about how different people in Africa celebrate their Christmas. People in Zimbabwe start Christmas with a church service, children dress up in their best clothes and they will prepare a feast to celebrate. But they don't stay at home for the whole day they will go door to door to visit family and friends.
In Zambia the whole family exchange gifts in the morning.
In summary people go to church and gather around to celebrate on Christmas
22/12/22, 22:44 - Jasmine Kaur: That seems fun, 
Also, how do you want to enter the new year?
Which are your top 3 goals?
22/12/22, 23:00 - Dephine EWYL22E0579: Well I would like to improve my ways of doing things I would like to use the ideation techniques that I learnt yesterday to develop myself.
I would also like to Improve my grades so that in that I can excel in my academics at the end of the year since this is the year I will be writing my final.
I also want to be a better person than I am now
23/12/22, 00:32 - Jasmine Kaur: How do you think I will help you doing that?
Like how can we work as a team towards the same?
23/12/22, 01:01 - Jasmine Kaur: Please inform!

24/12/22, 18:29 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings Proud Edoofians,

The holiday season is upon us and it’s time to light up the Christmas trees and indulge ourselves in the festivities. I assume due to the Christmas and New year seasons everyone is in a buoyant mood?

 Well, then I implore you to avail this time to spend with your family and friends. We are announcing holidays from tomorrow, 24th December 2022 to till 1st January 2023. You are required to report on 2nd January 2023.
Go out with friends to parties, eat with no concern, go to a church or set up Christmas at your home. Have a Christmas and New Year of your desire. Then come back with much more energy as your EWYL team has planned a very fruitful year ahead of you.

Many more projects, more skills to master, more exposure to new companies, more knowledge, and more surprises.

 Are you excited? Well, let the passion in you burn as we are waiting for you to come back stronger. Let’s make a new resolution to new ventures with discoveries that are waiting to happen.

 Happy Holidays,

I asked you to report on 2nd January but, because I was not in town I could not reply in time.
I hope you enjoyed New Year,

 The ability to solve problems is a basic life skill and is essential to our day-to-day lives, at home, at school, and at work. We solve problems every day without really thinking about how we solve them. For example: it’s raining and you need to go to the store. What do you do? There are lots of possible solutions. Take your umbrella and walk. If you don't want to get wet, you can drive, or take the bus. There is no right way to solve this problem and different people will solve it differently. However in our Wednesday wisdom we learnt about some Problem solving strategies. As part of your Saturday activity, I want you to share with us a problem that you encountered very recently and how did you Solve It. Did you use any strategy that was similar to what Munger has talked about?

Looking forward to your responses!


We will continue the discussion we left on Monday! 
Do not forget to send *I am a proud edoofian* even on Sunday!!

We will try to find a solution to this on Monday.

Do share your results with me on Monday, if they’re out.
