18/11/22, 01:16 - Moreblessing EWYL22E0691: Greetings, Mr. Anadi, I am <Moreblessing Murumbi> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Moreblessing Murumbi EWYL22E0691
18/11/22, 01:20 - Unknown: Greetings My Dear Proud Edoofian! Glad to hear from you! This is a reminder for our session tomorrow at 12 pm Zimbabwe Time or 3:30 pm Indian Time.
18/11/22, 01:21 - Unknown: I want you to follow the Proud Edoofian Ritual every day, without any fail, as it keeps our bond strong and intact.
18/11/22, 01:21 - Moreblessing EWYL22E0691: Okay sir
18/11/22, 18:35 - Moreblessing EWYL22E0691: I am a proud Edoofian
18/11/22, 18:37 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

22/11/22, 22:29 - Moreblessing EWYL22E0691: My aims are to work extremely hard both in my education and my EWYL program so as to acquire the maximum scholarship credits which will in turn minimize my annual fees further, thereby reducing my parents expenses. I would really love it if I'm able to earn $150 worth scholarship credits to finish my registration fee before my A-level results are out. I want to be able to multitask, use time wisely, do everything at its own time and remain super active. I hope to have advanced my communication skills which will be an added advantage in my career and also make me a better person.Good time management will also help me finish my tasks in time and still be left with time to socialize and be with family.

Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals towards achieving this goal. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

I would appreciate you sharing your learnings from today’s lesson.
