I'm very sorry ma'am
11/10/22, 01:20 - Unknown: No worries, but please take care of such things from next time.
11/10/22, 01:21 - Unknown: So Dadirai, this week we had an amazing video activity and I am so excited to share it with you because I know you will love it.
11/10/22, 01:21 - Unknown: Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. Those unfamiliar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.
Responses will be accepted on the *EWYL Line* only.
_Till then keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'_.
11/10/22, 01:23 - Dadirai EWYL21E0777: Ok ma'am thank you very much
11/10/22, 14:26 - Dadirai EWYL21E0777: Good morning I am a proud Edoofian

13/10/22, 00:57 - Unknown: We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real-life example. That is how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because in the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.
Responses will be submitted on the EWYL Line only.

Happy Learning.

How are you?
01/11/22, 22:45 - Unknown: No worries Dadirai.
Now that you are back, please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' on the EWY Line.
01/11/22, 22:46 - Unknown: Also a few days back, I shared an opportunity with you on the EWYL Line as well as on the EWYL Group.
I guess due to your error in the device, you might have missed that.
Let me share it with you on a priority because I feel you are one of my bright students.
01/11/22, 23:14 - Unknown: I have come up with a brilliant opportunity for you?
This is an amazing and exciting time for you to become the *face of the EDOOFA SCHOLARSHIP Program.*?
So, Ms. Deepali, Head of Team EWYL, and I, your proud mentor, have prepared this opportunity to show the face of our dedicated students on Edoofa's social media platforms.

What all you have to do for this:
-you have to speak about TRUST BUILDING
# in the video you have to speak about _HOW CRUCIAL IT IS TO SHARE TRUE INFORMATION WITH EVERYONE_. How it is a sad fact that people share wrong information about Edoofa. But we have to trust the people here, your counselors, mentors, and the whole Team.

- The video has to be made professionally: wear a shirt, have a decent background, and have a stable camera.

- the video has to be about 60-90 seconds long.

- *DEADLINE: WEDNESDAY (that is tomorrow), 12 PM*
01/11/22, 23:26 - Dadirai EWYL21E0777: Good morning I am a proud Edoofian

How are you?

Someone, who never gives up, or quits on the dream they see and really want to fulfill, no matter what. Moving through scorching heat, drenching rains, and heavy snow, they reach their destination and complete their journey. In this lesson, you will also learn, what happens when an entire community inherits this trait and keeps working on it. How recognition is earned and respect is gained through time, patience, and endless efforts.

So, in our session on the EWYL Line, we will discuss:
1) your views on the Wednesday lesson
2) *Google and Facebook reviews* (if it is not done)
03/11/22, 21:37 - Unknown: In case you have any pending responses left, please share them by today itself.
This November, I want that all the opportunities that I have like:
- *Edoofian of the week*
- *Projects other than our three ongoing ones*
- *Webinars*

to go to only those students who are responsible and serious about their sessions.
In case, I had to remind you more than once a week to follow the daily ritual, not only I would be taken aback to share these amazing opportunities with you but also all these interesting and learning lessons and activities will be stopped.
Make sure that from today onwards you follow the daily ritual and share your responses with me timely.
03/11/22, 21:37 - Unknown: Also for the month of *NOVEMBER*, I want that you put your focus on any one project, out of
1) Corporate Alliance\/Company Connect
2) Community Building
3) African School Reform 

Choose any *ONE*, and then we will put all our focus on it.
I want that this NOVEMBER, you earn and aim for LOTS OF SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS.
03/11/22, 21:37 - Unknown: You can get to know about the same from Ms. Vilsha, our Admissions Officer at Edoofa.
03/11/22, 23:52 - Dadirai EWYL21E0777: Good afternoon ma'am

3) an acclamation from your side that yes, you will be regular in following the daily ritual, and responses

Through the previous Wednesday lesson, we got an idea that how necessary it is to grab every opportunity and make the best use of it. Also, it is well said that  is a will, there is a way. But to make this opportunity, we must have extremely useful and fruitful skills that can turn into a big game. And telling these skills and practices that are necessary for grabbing skills was the *weekend activity* all about.
I want you to *share your views on the same with me here*.

15/07/22, 01:15 - Dadirai EWYL21E0777: There are a plenty of skills and practices that a student should uphold as an Edoofian to be givena chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits.One of these skills and practices includes communication . Inorder for a student to participate in the projects one should communicate with other students in many schools ,they should be as many as possible.Also ,for a student to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits one should have confidence in whatever tasks you are given and required to do.Time management is also required for a student to earn as many scholarship credits as possible.Moreover for a student to be given a chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits,we should practice on how to communicate with our mentors.They will give useful information on how to work on projects and earn more scholarship credits.

15/07/22, 22:38 - Unknown: Good evening Dadirai!
How's your day going?
15/07/22, 22:39 - Unknown: I am really glad to hear your understanding of the activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY* . They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.
15/07/22, 22:44 - Unknown: Since Dadirai I did not receive your response to any of the lessons and activities sent last week, I did not pile you up with more activities. But since now you have successfully amazed me with such a knowledgeable response, I am sharing with you this week's WEDNESDAY WISDOM. Please make sure you submit the response by the end of the day.
15/07/22, 22:45 - Unknown: *WEDNESDAY WISDOM*
This week we're going to learn how the son of a former teacher in an African school made over $1 billion dollars. You did read it correctly.

22/07/22, 22:59 - Unknown: WEEKEND ACTIVITY  that time of the week when you are required to wear your thinking caps and get your tools ready to research and learn! From our Wednesday Wisdom, we learned how Patrice Motsepe, became successful by making the best of the opportunity very few could see, the strong potential in the mining industry. As part of your Saturday Activity, you are required to share a detailed submission on the fast-growing industry\/sector\/business in your country. Don’t forget to add a SWOT analysis and predictions on the future performance of the same.

Word limit- 250-500 words\u2028Use of the internet is allowed but do not copy the entire submission from the internet. You have to write it in your own words.
22/07/22, 22:59 - Unknown: Along with this, let's move on with our session.
Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our WEDNESDAY Wisdom was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
3. your response to the weekend activity (you can share that with me by the end of the day)
22/07/22, 23:04 - Dadirai EWYL21E0777: Ok ma'am thank you very much I will share it with you.

23/07/22, 02:50 - Unknown: SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. It is sometimes called situational assessment or situational analysis.

25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

28/07/22, 22:38 - Unknown: We are back with our Wednesday lesson.

I realised as soon as I started reading this lesson that most of my students needed to learn and grasp this. One person succeeding and one failing depends solely on how effectively they manage their time. Try to comprehend and apply the measures discussed in the lesson to your everyday life. I'll be here to help you so that you can focus on learning how to manage your time effectively. In our following session, please explain in detail what you learned from the lesson.

Happy learning!

29/07/22, 18:42 - Dadirai EWYL21E0777: From the task ,I have learnt that time management is very important in whatever you do in life.Time management is the ability to use our time productively and efficiently.I have understood that inorder to be time conscious there should be a combination of working productively and prioritizing your time.There is the distinction between urgent and important which is the key to prioritizing your time and your workload,whether at work,at home  or when studying.This enables  an individual to work out what to do first and what can be left either until later or not done at all.Also the priority matrix has taught me on how to manage my tasks at a certain period of time ,for instance you can manage your tasks on how important is the task.I have also learnt that I should not put of important things because they are unpleasant.

How's your day going?
30/07/22, 02:06 - Unknown: Your response to the Wednesday wisdom has made me realize our childhood quote  is Money'.
Through Wednesday Wisdom, my main aim was to educate my Edoofians about TIME MANAGEMENT and HOW IT CAN BE ACHIEVED.
You know are very well aware of what Time management means, let me tell you about what Time Management includes:

#Effective Planning
# Setting goals and objectives
# Setting deadlines
# Delegation of responsibilities
# Prioritizing activities as per their importance
# Spending the right time on the right activity

The benefits of Time Management are:
- Time Management makes an individual punctual and disciplined.
- One becomes more organized as a result of effective Time Management.
- Individuals who stick to a time plan are the ones who realize their goals and objectives within the shortest possible period. 
- Research says that individuals who accomplish tasks on time are less prone to stress and anxiety. 

How can we achieve it:
# Set a goal for yourself.
# Priority matrix (like we talked about in the Wednesday lesson)
# Organize your study space
# Do a SWOT Analysis of yourself.

I am sure you will note all these things and imply in your day-to-day life and do share with me what changes you have felt.

It ensures equal distribution of time among activities and subjects, creates a smooth workflow, prevents wasting of time and efforts, and aids in creating good habits.
The *weekend activity* asked you to draw a timetable for yourself and of course, have time for your scheduled sessions as well.
I am excited to see your timetable and of course, we can discuss how we can manage our sessions accordingly.

Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
