17/08/22, 22:28 - Unknown: You must have tried to incorporate the three success mantras you learned about in our Wednesday lesson into your daily activities. Now, the majority of successful people also adhere to a select few other success mantras. I want you to share with me the success mantra that best suits your personality and that you have already mastered as part of this week's assignment. Share a success habit that you wish to develop this year in order to master it by the end of the year. Thirdly, I want you to describe your role model and the success behaviors you admire most about them in a short essay.

You are required to share these 3 responses over the dedicated EWYL line today.

17/08/22, 23:00 - Mthulisi EWYL21E0655: What is my success mantra
 
 I believe everything in this world is not difficult as I think of how to succeed in life.Everything is way to possible that even most disabled people find a way to reach they dreams,my plan everyday is that one day I will succeed and become what I have actually noted in my heart to come through.i work up everyday knowing that am a morning person because my attitude determines my altitude,I made a change and it changed my life,for example choosing God as my savior changed the way I was before.Now am working on my dream and goals and believe I can overcome every single obstacle that comes out my way.I can spend a week without eating if there is no food or money to buy something but I cannot stop studying or learning because I don't have books to read.In life I am 85% show that I talk positive things about my life and my reactions have honestly changed so that also the outcome will be exchanged.I don't have high expectations but I believe success is  on the way and things will change.Since I ever arrived in this place I have told myself that by the end of this year I should be fluent in speaking English and I have planned that by always trying to create conversations with those who like to.
17/08/22, 23:20 - Mthulisi EWYL21E0655: Who is my role model  
 
 My role model is Steve Harvey because this young man have inspired since day one I knew about him.The huge thing is that he quoted that my reality is mine and everybody by my side ain't on my side.

His quotes are strongly interesting because as a student who is eager to succeed in life you learn a lot.The last thing is that Steve Harvey said success is the result of perfection,hard work,learning from failure,loyalty,and persistence.

God has already lined up all the people in my path to get to get to my dreams am my visions,all I have to do is to get rid of wrong ones.

I am never too old to reinvent myself.

20/08/22, 19:35 - Mthulisi EWYL21E0655: Good afternoon sir i am a proud Edoofian. 
 My takeaways on the Wednesday wisdom is that I as a student I have understood a lot and after reading I realized that maybe if I try what I really want to do,it will probably go very well because sometimes there's no harm in trying.I have thought about being an motivational speaker but sometimes i get that mind of,this won't help me with anything,I think negative about myself when I start struggling with such thing but all I need is perseverance so that I will be genius in the years coming.Being a motivational speaker i realized that you also learn and always have plans for life.After reading am truly sure they will be a bit change but what am not sure about is that is it a good thing to invest on or i should try everything that have came on my mind before.Sometimes i become hard on myself and think maybe I am a failure but struggle to die a legend.

25/08/22, 22:10 - Unknown: As I shared with you yesterday, this week's Wednesday Wisdom focused on three business success stories that went from rags to riches and became epitome of motivation. Did you read the story shared by Ms Davi?
26/08/22, 00:41 - Mthulisi EWYL21E0655: The things that led to the success of all the three man is that in everything they were doing they had faith and also that they worked very hard for change as we see that CDE modi got another job were he was paid $250 better money than his previous job.Also as the one who gained profit through selling of phones we realize how clever he was though he was still at school.This people did not care about the how agly the places are to live but they only did what can lead them to success.As for i who also deems to become a successful human being i have learnt a lot that sometimes being that type of a child with less clothes does not mean it won't be good for me and these people inspire me to an extent that i see so much change towards everything that i have dreamt of.Furthermore,am grateful they made it in life and can probably imagine how rich they are today after their hard work.

I wish to say this at last,that everyone who is struggling for succes may God grant us  peace and prosperity so that we achieve our dreams and purposes without anything that disturbs our journey to a successful life?.

Happy New Week, my proud Edoofian! How was your weekend?
18/07/22, 19:27 - Unknown: Mthulisi, Did you work on the  very interesting Weekend activity? 

I personally enjoyed learning about SWOT analysis and implementing it for my self. I hope you did too.
18/07/22, 21:24 - Mthulisi EWYL21E0655: Currently working on the activity sir please?
18/07/22, 21:25 - Mthulisi EWYL21E0655: ?
18/07/22, 23:03 - Unknown: Great Mthulisi!
18/07/22, 23:03 - Unknown: Do share the response with me.
18/07/22, 23:03 - Unknown: In the meantime, Let me first help you understand what SWOT Analysis is.

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment.This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organisations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
19/07/22, 02:52 - Unknown: Did you read my above message Mthulisi?
19/07/22, 03:50 - Mthulisi EWYL21E0655: Sir may I know that on the above activity,is it possible for me to mention the business that i know which is fast growing and add brief note on how it started and also how it has so far benefited the country
19/07/22, 19:32 - Unknown: Hello Mthulisi! How are you doing?
19/07/22, 19:32 - Unknown: Yes Mthulisi, it is absolutely possible for you to mention these details.
19/07/22, 19:33 - Mthulisi EWYL21E0655: Ouk sir
19/07/22, 19:33 - Mthulisi EWYL21E0655: Good morning sir i am a proud Edoofian
19/07/22, 19:33 - Unknown: However Mthulisi, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym SWOT:

1 Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
2 Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
3 Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
4 Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by
19/07/22, 19:34 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride.

19/07/22, 20:11 - Mthulisi EWYL21E0655: Yes yes this is profound
19/07/22, 20:11 - Mthulisi EWYL21E0655: Businesses face these
19/07/22, 21:39 - Unknown: You know why SWOT Analysis is important? It can help you to challenge risky assumptions and to uncover dangerous blindspots about your organization's performance. If you use it carefully and collaboratively, it can deliver new insights on where your business currently is, and help you to develop exactly the right strategy for any situation.
19/07/22, 21:39 - Unknown: Mthulisi, For example, you may be well aware of some of your organization's strengths, but until you record them alongside weaknesses and threats you might not realize how unreliable those strengths actually are.
19/07/22, 23:00 - Mthulisi EWYL21E0655: Yeah I understand now sir
19/07/22, 23:16 - Unknown: Now, What Are the Biggest SWOT Analysis Mistakes that people make?
19/07/22, 23:51 - Unknown: Here are some of the mistakes I believe people make:
1 Making your lists too long. Ask yourself if your ideas are feasible as you go along.
2 Being vague. Be specific to provide more focus for later discussions.
3. Not seeing weaknesses. Be sure to ask customers and colleagues what they experience in real life.
4. Not thinking ahead. It's easy to come up with nice ideas without taking them through to their logical conclusion. Always consider their practical impact.
5 Being unrealistic. Don't plan in detail for opportunities that don't exist yet.
