16/11/23, 13:43 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello and good day!

May today play out like a flawless melody, where each note blends into a symphony of happiness and success.
Are you prepared for the session?

16/11/23, 14:26 - Aditi Kapoor: I am sharing this week's lesson go through it and share your understanding with me.
You missed it as you didn't follow your daily ritual, make sure you follow it everyday.
16/11/23, 14:26 - Brandon EWYL23E0695: Thank you for understanding
16/11/23, 14:26 - Aditi Kapoor: Wednesday wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

04/12/23, 13:30 - Brandon EWYL23E0695: The target students were busy with examinations so it was hard to connect with them
04/12/23, 13:30 - Brandon EWYL23E0695: Now that they are done I can follow up
04/12/23, 13:31 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, I understand.
04/12/23, 13:31 - Aditi Kapoor: And what about the School's project?
04/12/23, 13:33 - Brandon EWYL23E0695: No updates for now
04/12/23, 13:35 - Aditi Kapoor: May I know the reason behind it?
04/12/23, 13:36 - Brandon EWYL23E0695: I want to do them one by one not simultaneously
04/12/23, 13:37 - Aditi Kapoor: Certainly!
I understand your preference to tackle tasks one by one instead of simultaneously. May I ask about the specific reasons or benefits you find in handling tasks one by one? Your insights will help in aligning our approach with your preferences.
04/12/23, 13:42 - Brandon EWYL23E0695: So that i don't get it mixed up and I make sure I do my best in each one of them
04/12/23, 13:46 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, I understand.

04/12/23, 13:48 - Aditi Kapoor: _*Hello, my Proud Edoofian*_!

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

Best Regards

04/12/23, 14:16 - Brandon EWYL23E0695: The challenge I have faced so far was lack of feedback from the target students as they were trying to focus on examinations but I know that won't be a problem now as they are done.. I just have to reach out frequently
04/12/23, 14:18 - Aditi Kapoor: It's understandable that students were focused on exams, causing a lack of feedback. Now that exams are done, reaching out more frequently should help address this challenge. Consistent communication can play a crucial role in keeping them informed and engaged. Best of luck with your efforts, and feel free to share any updates or concerns along the way!
04/12/23, 14:29 - Aditi Kapoor: Alright! This is it for today. So we will resume our session in your allotted time slot.

07/12/23, 13:36 - Brandon EWYL23E0695: Not yet
07/12/23, 13:38 - Aditi Kapoor: May I know why?
07/12/23, 13:48 - Brandon EWYL23E0695: Am yet to get there
07/12/23, 13:50 - Aditi Kapoor: Brandon, it's been a few days I have been hearing this, I need  a specific answer in this.
07/12/23, 13:53 - Brandon EWYL23E0695: I have to balance the projects and my day to day schedule, if I do them all at once it will be too much pressure
07/12/23, 13:57 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, so would you like to tell me about your schedule so that I can help you with the time management.
07/12/23, 13:59 - Brandon EWYL23E0695: I have this hustle that I am doing everyday from 9am to 6pm
07/12/23, 14:04 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, I understand.
07/12/23, 14:45 - Aditi Kapoor: We didn't get to some key discussions and please make sure that you follow the ritual every day, without constant reminders from my side before 9 AM, as you mentioned that you work 9 to 6.
Also I believe that you can work on these projects around 8-9 PM when you are back and have some free time at your hand trust me it won't take you more than half an hour.
I hope you get my point.
07/12/23, 15:04 - Brandon EWYL23E0695: I get your point
07/12/23, 15:04 - Brandon EWYL23E0695: Thank you for the advice

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
Team EWYL
