20/05/23, 13:49 - Lorraine EWYL23E0192: I am a proud Edoofian 🙂
20/05/23, 13:49 - Jasmine Kaur: `- That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!`

`- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.``- How do you intend to broaden this student community? 

In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.
20/05/23, 13:49 - Lorraine EWYL23E0192: Okay
20/05/23, 13:55 - Lorraine EWYL23E0192: I intend to broaden this student  community by connecting with other potential students through the EWYL projects
20/05/23, 14:14 - Lorraine EWYL23E0192: Did l say it right
22/05/23, 09:50 - Lorraine EWYL23E0192: Leadership is the ability in an individual or a group of people to influence or guide people to aachieve a certain goal. It would be a great pleasure that through Edoofa EWYL program,l will obtain leadership skills.l am going to prioritize the African Schools Education Reform Mission,since with this l will be connecting with locals .If the students join the Edoofa program,not only one but a lot of lives will be saved by innovation and knowledge being brought to Africa,and less financial burden.I will be able to ensure that my name is on the next list of student leaders for the Edoofa student community by helping fellow students receive this life changing opportunity of studying in India and help them pursue their dream.
31/05/23, 15:59 - Lorraine EWYL23E0192: Good afternoon
31/05/23, 16:00 - Jasmine Kaur: Hi Lorraine! Glad to connect with you once again!
31/05/23, 16:01 - Lorraine EWYL23E0192: Yes it's a pleasure
31/05/23, 16:04 - Jasmine Kaur: Now Lorraine tell me about the Edoofa Grant that you have learnt!
31/05/23, 16:13 - Lorraine EWYL23E0192: I do not know much but l saw students being given scholarship credits because of the hardwork ,good behavior and EWYL program
31/05/23, 16:13 - Lorraine EWYL23E0192: But l would love to know more about the Edoofa grant
12/06/23, 14:07 - Lorraine EWYL23E0192: Good morning
12/06/23, 14:10 - Lorraine EWYL23E0192: l intend to build a stronger Edoofa student community through career motivation.It has come to my observation that most students are no longer interested in pursuing higher education because it seems impossible and worst of time. This is because there are many students who have seen graduates with no jobs and university fee is too much for them to pay ,thus after finishing high school they look for jobs to earn a living .So l wish to create a group where l will motivate students and make them see how they can achieve their dreams through the Edoofa program,which provides affordable education, international experience and have skills to be ready for 21st century business skills
12/06/23, 19:19 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello Lorraine! How are you?

21/06/23, 01:09 - Lorraine EWYL23E0192: All the four figures are inspiring models that can help students believe and act in their dreams.They are showing us that having a dream is a starting for what you will achieve and many lives will be blessed and saved because of it,so it's worth fighting for.My favorite among them is Ruvheneko Parirenyatwa.The similarities  l have seen between us is passion to develop social changes especially among youth and creatin own production company that  can be  used to help others with all ideas and lessons that can be shared.The difference between us is that she has achieved her goals and l am yet to fulfill mine.Whats most inspiring about her is that  Parirenyatwa launched her broadcasting career whilst she was a student at the University of Cape Town She joined the university's radio station when she was in her second year as the current affairs talk show .This reminds me that l can start fulfilling my dream whilst l am still pursuing my higher education. Furthermore follows her success stories which are already a motivation for me ,for she pursued and gained what she wanted .With the help of Edoofa ,l can already forsee my story being an inspiration to some others one day.

I am grateful to Edoofa despite giving a scholarship is also offering guidesteps to success that cannot be learnt in schools or just offered to people .l find myself blessed to have known Edoofa and this awe inspiring figure Ruvheneko Parirenyatwa.

28/06/23, 15:50 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!
