How are you?
17/01/23, 00:26 - Unknown: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
17/01/23, 00:27 - Unknown: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
17/01/23, 00:40 - Mashonganyika Marshall: I've that clearly

While listening is an important skill, the art of asking questions is equally, if not more, important when it comes to learning more about your work tasks, unlocking hidden opportunities, delivering better results, and mitigating unforeseen risks. 
We have five guidelines to keep or to start asking good questions.

We discuss the following things:
1) what did you learn about it
2) progress on projects

1) the two questions you will raise
2) your progress on projects
23/01/23, 19:32 - Mashonganyika Marshall: The questions are

1)What am I going to be in 10 years time

How are you?
31/01/23, 21:29 - Unknown: So, Rufaro this weekend we did not share any weekend activity with our students so that we can solely focus on building targets for the month of February. May I know what you thought about the same?
Since you have chosen the community building project, may I know about that?
31/01/23, 22:50 - Mashonganyika Marshall: I'm alright how are you
31/01/23, 22:52 - Mashonganyika Marshall: Well for a start I have been informing a couple of friends about edoofa and have given them an offline form to fill
01/02/23, 00:46 - Unknown: For *Community Building Project*

Some of my students have formed WhatsApp groups with names like Edoofa Scholarship Prog\/Study In India\/Mission India by Edooda and so on…
This is how they begin-
First, they keep sharing the link of that WhatsApp group (which they formed) in their family groups, class groups, and school groups (A-Level and O-Level), with the children who stay nearby (who want to pursue their higher education), and, try to circulate all around.
Second, once new people get added to the group, they are told about Edoofa, the perks of being associated with it, why studying in India could be a great opportunity, their journey so far, learnings from EWYL Program, and more.
Third, they share the community building form with them, and then the children fill out the form and share it with me.
01/02/23, 00:46 - Unknown: Let's connect tomorrow for the updates.

I will be sharing the Wednesday wisdom with you tomorrow!

Till then, please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'.
Have a great day!
01/02/23, 03:12 - Mashonganyika Marshall: Ohhh okay then I'll form my group
01/02/23, 03:12 - Mashonganyika Marshall: Thank you
01/02/23, 21:48 - Mashonganyika Marshall: Good afternoon

02/02/23, 00:15 - Unknown: Greetings Rufaro!
How are you?
02/02/23, 01:18 - Mashonganyika Marshall: Greetings to you too....
I'm doing well
02/02/23, 01:19 - Mashonganyika Marshall: Ummm not yet i still have very few participants so I need to get more
02/02/23, 19:26 - Unknown: Greetings Rufaro!
How are you?
02/02/23, 19:26 - Unknown: Please make sure that you follow the daily ritual with full consistency daily.
02/02/23, 19:27 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
02/02/23, 19:27 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
02/02/23, 19:40 - Mashonganyika Marshall: Good Morning to you
I am a proud edoofian
02/02/23, 19:41 - Mashonganyika Marshall: Understood
02/02/23, 21:05 - Unknown: May I know how do you think that people can be attracted in the group?
02/02/23, 21:51 - Mashonganyika Marshall: Well to attract people into the group I think maybe putting a better group description first the benefits of the program maybe... I think people will be attracted by knowing the good of the program first
02/02/23, 22:21 - Unknown: That's correct!
As like I informed you, you can reach out to A-Level and O-Level students through their unofficial groups.
03/02/23, 00:06 - Mashonganyika Marshall: So then I'll try even O levels toi
03/02/23, 01:30 - Unknown: I am sharing a link below, You can go through this during your free time. It contains information regarding the skills that are required by anyone who wants to succeed in his\/.her career.

06/02/23, 19:10 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, Let me share a small story with you!                                                                                                                                                                                       Ready??                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
