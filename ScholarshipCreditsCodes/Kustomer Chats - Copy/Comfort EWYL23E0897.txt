In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental.

13/12/23, 22:55 - Comfort EWYL23E0897: Good afternoon ma'am
I would like share my understanding on today's Wednesday wisdom.
Starting with Honesty,as a pillar of success,i understand is all about being truthful and sincere in your words and actions.one should first of all be true with oneself then others because it builds trust,strengthens relationships and promotes integrity..College students need this virtue..One has to be true to oneself first in order to set realistic goals,discover strengths and weaknesses.
Honesty is also important in the academic realm to professors and fellow students in order to succeed.
13/12/23, 22:55 - Comfort EWYL23E0897: Another pillar of success is hard work.
College life demands dedication,setting goals and focusing to achieving them,perseverance and putting much effort.
Continuous learning is one of the key aspects of hard work..school is not only about learning but also desire to long life learning,critical thinking skills and problem solving abilities.
A hardworking student is determined by his/her resilience and honesty.
A student has to discover more than their coursework and dedicate themselves in group discussions and academics more..hard work and success works hand in hand.

19/12/23, 16:30 - Ananya: Comfort, may I know why are you late today?
19/12/23, 16:31 - Comfort EWYL23E0897: I thought like there will be no session today since you haven't responded yet to my last contribution
19/12/23, 16:37 - Ananya: Comfort, primarily you have to be here on your session timings. It is crucial to be punctual. You have submitted your wednesday lesson response after our session time.
19/12/23, 16:39 - Comfort EWYL23E0897: I am sorry .
This is well noted
19/12/23, 16:42 - Ananya: So, Comfort, you know, 2023 is wrapping up. Don't you think we should kick off the new year with something big? How about committing to earning a specific amount of scholarship credits?
After all, you wouldn't want to head to India empty-handed.

I'm saying this from my own experience ‚Äì having some credits before you arrive in India isn't just a benefit for you; it's a help for your parents too. Not only this, we often pick students for internships and personal training based on their credits and regularity in the EWYL journey.
Believe me, you've got plenty of time right now being in your home country, so don;t you think we should utilize this time with our utmost dedication?
19/12/23, 16:44 - Comfort EWYL23E0897: Yes that's right...We have to use the opportunity
19/12/23, 16:45 - Ananya: Absolutely, I've finalized a few students for a 30-day challenge, and I want you to be a part of it. I need you to attend the sessions dedicatedly and put in the hard work for your EWYL projects.
Moreover, I'll set specific targets for you, and I want your commitment to work diligently to achieve them. As your mentor, I'll be there to guide and support you every step of the way. Is that alright with you?
19/12/23, 16:51 - Comfort EWYL23E0897: That's alright
19/12/23, 17:00 - Ananya: Amazing! Let's set a new target for you. For the first 10 days out of the 30, I want you to focus on connecting with two schools and getting eight students to submit their offline application forms.
If you encounter any challenges during this time, reach out to me immediately because we need to achieve this target. I expect you to give it your best effort. Goo day!
19/12/23, 17:01 - Comfort EWYL23E0897: ü•≥Alright
