16/05/23, 15:48 - Abisai EWYL22E1032: I am a proud Edoofian.

Greetings Ms. Ananya.
I am Abisai Zvirasheyi and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion.My EWYL group name is 'Abisai EWYL22E1032'.
16/05/23, 15:48 - Ananya: `- That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!`

`- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.``- How do you intend to broaden this student community? 

In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.
16/05/23, 15:49 - Abisai EWYL22E1032: Noted Ms. Ananya
19/05/23, 17:48 - Abisai EWYL22E1032: From the Wednesday lesson,I understand that there is servant leadership,one which is different from the traditional leadership that has been there throughout world history.Servant leadership is a form of leadership where the leader is the one who serve his people or his employees,making sure they achieve their goals and get what they want  before the leader do.An example of of servant leadership may be the founders of Edoofa,they have been passionate about changing lives  now a strong constant effort is observed from their end in the growth  and development of everyone in the Edoofa family.Servant leaders are characterized by some of the following characteristics; empathy, listening,persuasion,foresight and healing.
Empathy is when the leader  understand one's perspectives and viewpoints value them more.The leader has to be open minded.Listening in one of the important characters.The leader listens to someone and understand what he or she is trying to say.He doesn't interrupt him as he is still talking.It deals with understanding the body language of someone to be listened.Healing deals with emotional health,being able to  comfort mentally and physically.Foresight is when one is able to predict what's likely to happen in the future basing on his experience or knowledge as well as wisdom.
19/05/23, 18:03 - Ananya: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the Wednesday lesson. It is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.
19/05/23, 18:06 - Abisai EWYL22E1032: Well noted ,thank you.

What did Alex's passion and dedication lead him to?
a) Winning a sports competition
b) Receiving an art scholarship
c) Participating in a theater production
d) Entering a prestigious music competition
22/05/23, 22:08 - Abisai EWYL22E1032: Good evening Ms. Ananya.
22/05/23, 22:09 - Abisai EWYL22E1032: The projects and newsletters are a very important part of my EWYL program because they transmogrify my views towards the world around me and they also insert that leadership characteristic in me.The newsletters introduce the characterictics and personality required for one to become a good leader.I learnt about being a good leader and also the ways  to connect with the society that I'm living in.I'm willing to keep on learning and I can say that I know  I'm going to keep learning and develop.That's one of the reasons why I say today,'I am a proud Edoofian'.I remember from lesson 1,when I learnt about the important virtue,humility,sharing opportunities with the community,moving forward  to learn about being a hero,harming myself to improve,motivate and inspire the people around me.I also learnt about  being a serving leader,which is more like to be a hero to the community around,having empathy,listening and being able to heal other students as well as other people mentally,and so many other things that makes me feel proud of the opportunity to be an Edoofian.Project 1,2 and 3 are so important.From the projects,I learn to face failure and rejections which help me build a never giving up attitide.The projects also teach me to share opportunities and create an impact in people's lives,improve my communication skills and most importantly I reach out to leaders and other people who are influential.Having great  opportunities like this,to learn everyday to become a good leader build a secure future for me and I'm really grateful for a wonderful opportunity like this.By reading the newsletters carefully and working on my projects keeping in mind to follow instructions and being open minded,I believe I can be a good leader in the students' community.Last but not least,I have to lead by example,I need to achieve the goals I set for myself by dedicating my time and being consistent.Achieving my goals inspire and motivate the people around me and they get a chance to achieve their own goals,just like what Michael Jordan did.He was consistent with his goals and because of that he inspired Kobe and Lebron and Kobe inspired Giannis.All of them are now considered  best players in NBA and it is like an energy of inspiration from Jordan because he led by example.

29/05/23, 13:13 - Abisai EWYL22E1032: I am a proud Edoofian.Good morning Ms. Ananya.
29/05/23, 13:13 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above

09/06/23, 16:27 - Abisai EWYL22E1032: I understand that one has to gain a competitive advantage and this is when an individual identifies his strengths and leverage them using them for his or her own advantage.The authors of the book which the principle came from also emphasize the learning of skills which are so highly required in the field of work since the world that changes everyday.The other skill required is to embrace a permanent beta mindset.This is continuously improving yourself not waiting for perfection but constantly improving oneself.The book goes on to emphasize the use of network intelligence,constantly improving your professional network.Building beneficial relationships using social media platforms like LinkedIn, connect ing with influential leaders.the other also wrote about using strategic pivots.They also also discussed about using intelligent risks as an entrepreneur.The startup of you also mentions about making strong alliances with collauges,mentors and leaders.Relationships that are beneficial.
09/06/23, 16:28 - Ananya: I completely agree with your understanding of gaining a competitive advantage by identifying and leveraging your strengths to your advantage.

09/06/23, 16:30 - Abisai EWYL22E1032: Ms. Ananya I got some contacts of the school heads in my community.May  I share them with you, since you said you can help me I can I easily do it.

09/06/23, 16:31 - Ananya: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

10/06/23, 12:59 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week‚Äôs Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better‚Äîtogether. It‚Äôs why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger‚Äîas successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!
