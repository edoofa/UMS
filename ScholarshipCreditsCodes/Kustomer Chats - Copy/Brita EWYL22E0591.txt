Well, you know Our weekend was quite remarkable, as we hosted some exceptional students from PDM University who visited our office.

We organized an outing to Cyber Hub in Gurgaon, where they were able to experience various popular establishments such as McDonald's, Domino's, Decathlon, Marc and Spencer's, and Archies. They also had a chance to see the offices of some of the big companies like Toshiba, Kia etc.

It was a pleasure getting to know them outside of the sessions and having the opportunity to connect with them on a more personal level.

Furthermore, the students had the opportunity to spend time with our team at our office, participating in enjoyable activities.

Given the excitement of the experience, I feel compelled to share a glimpse of the event with you.
Therefore, I am sharing some videos below, I would be very glad to know your views on it. Soon, I will be sharing a detailed video on this with you.

As we go through life, we all make decisions - some good, and some bad. But what separates good decisions from bad decisions, and how can we learn from our experiences to make better choices in the future?

For your Saturday assignment, I would like you to write about your understanding of good decisions and bad decisions. What factors do you consider when making a decision, and how do you know when you have made a good or bad choice? In addition, I would like you to share an example from your life where you made a good or bad decision. What was the situation, what decision did you make, and what was the outcome? What did you learn from this experience, and how has it shaped your decision-making process in the future?

Your submission should be around 200 words in total, and I encourage you to reflect deeply on your experiences and thoughts on decision-making. Remember that we can all learn from our mistakes and successes, and by sharing our experiences, we can help each other make better choices in the future.
08/05/23, 13:47 - Brita EWYL22E0591: Okay sir

10/05/23, 11:55 - Unknown: Who is Africa's longest serving leader?

a. Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya
b. Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea
c. Nelson Mandela of South Africa
d. Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe
10/05/23, 13:12 - Brita EWYL22E0591: Good decisions are those actions that a person does which will result in good results. Bad decisions refer to actions that result in bad results.

When making a decision one must first consider the outcome. When making a choice a person should look at the end result but doing anything.This helps an individual to foretell the end result. As a result of that bad things can be avoided.

In addition to that an individual should consider the externalities the decision will have on others. The decision to be made could be a negative externality to others or a positive one. So therefore a person should consider the effect the decision to be could make on other people  interacting with him.

When making a decision one must consider as to whether he will be able to live up to the decision. For example if a person decides to invest in a project they should consider as to whether they can manage the project effectively. One should know whether they can fulfil the demands of the project
A person can differentiate a good decision from a bad one by looking at the outcome. If the possible outcome of the decision is likely to be bad then the decision itself will be bad. If the outcome is likely to be good then the decision itself will be considered good.
Good decision bring positive results to the decision maker and other people surrounding him. Bad decisions bring about bad results to the decision maker and other people surrounding him.

In my life l made a decision of putting education first. I worked hard with the intention of passing with great colours and I succeed.
10/05/23, 13:12 - Brita EWYL22E0591: The result of hard work was success.
10/05/23, 13:13 - Brita EWYL22E0591: Good morning sir
10/05/23, 13:17 - Brita EWYL22E0591: I apologise for the late response. I wasn't feeling well. I am better now
10/05/23, 14:56 - Unknown: I would like to take a moment to express my appreciation for the thoughtful and insightful understandings you shared on good decisions and bad decisions. Your analysis of the factors that influence decision-making and the outcomes that determine whether a choice is good or bad was particularly insightful.
10/05/23, 14:56 - Unknown: I hope that you are feeling fine now?
10/05/23, 14:58 - Unknown: Dear Proud Edoofian,

I am excited to announce that todayâ€™s Wednesday Wisdom will be talking about the spirit of belonging and the feeling of being part of the Edoofa student community. As a member of the Edoofa family, it is important to understand the significance of being part of a community that fosters personal and academic growth. We will explore the benefits of being part of the Edoofa student community, including the sense of belonging and unity that it creates, the opportunities for networking and mentorship, and the development of essential skills such as leadership, teamwork, and communication.
The Lesson also delve into the idea of belonging as an ability, and how we can develop this ability to connect with others, build relationships, and establish a sense of belonging that allows us to feel valued, appreciated, and accepted.

Let's come together to learn, grow, and build a stronger sense of community.
Best regards,
Team EWYL
