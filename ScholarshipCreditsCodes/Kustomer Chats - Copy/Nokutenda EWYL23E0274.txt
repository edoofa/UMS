28/06/23, 21:46 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

29/06/23, 03:27 - Nokutenda EWYL23E0274: The lesson was initiated by Alex who picked a book tittled The power of identity -based habits.He decided to embrace the concept of identity -based habits in life.Alex was an average student who had the zeal to achieve great things in life .

He applied the concept of identity -based habits which yielded results.The main key was to align one's habits with their desired identity.He realized he was blinded by wanting to achieve outcomes like good grades but never thought of who he wanted to become.

After the discovery he put forward the newly found wisdom into action, everyone around him was inspired by his dedication and decided to copy from him.Prior to that,Alex learnt to embrace challenges in his life as he learnt that challenges are an opportunity to start again more intelligently and as an opportunity for growth rather than obstacles.

01/07/23, 16:00 - Ananya: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!
03/07/23, 00:25 - Nokutenda EWYL23E0274: Good evening ma'am.

Please ma'am!

04/07/23, 12:14 - Nokutenda EWYL23E0274: The person l aspired to be

All protocols observed and my regards to the students who are bound to get inspired by my auspicious story of my journey to success.

In this current era where philosophy has ruled over reality,the achievement of dreams and ambitions have been halted rather than being thrived for,in a small town of Makoni lived an ambitious and vigilant girl by the name Esther.

When students embark on their educational journey they're bound to face various challenger but l as a student have become a successor of my own challenges l've managed to conquer my fears.Growing up l always lacked self confidence,that is l had self doubt,academic difficulties due to poor planning and time management as well as external negativity.Prior to that,l was not confident enough to prove my capability to the world,l was time unconscious.

Consequently,these challenges gave birth to limiting beliefs that l watered as a garden of flowers in my life,it impeded my ability to strive towards the achievement of my dreams.

Relating to the achievement of my success,l had to excuse myself from situations that sucked all my energy,l learnt that boundaries are not punishment but are an act of preservation.However by recognizing and addressing these limiting beliefs,my fellow colleagues could also adopt a thing or two and use it to develop effective strategies to navigate these obstacles and ultimately accomplish desired aims through me.

Limiting beliefs are the deeply ingrained thoughts and perceptions that hinder personal growth and impedes progress.As a student l had self doubt and fear of failure.l wasn't sure if l could excel academically neither could l achieve my dreams.

Firstly l had to build self confidence inorder to combat limiting beliefs.l had to recognize my strengths and strategize my schedules because l was poor at time management inorder to set realistic goals that gradually pushed me beyond my comfort zone.Prior to that,l had to prioritize tasks as well as minimizing activities that steal my time.Inorder for me to grow,l had to embrace a growth mindset by seeing challenges as an opportunity for growth,l reframed on my beliefs and approached obstacles with a positive learning-oriented mind.

Furthermore,l strategized my activities and gave myself time to study and focus on my studies with a growing mind that today is better than tomorrow.My greatest triumphs were born of my greatest challenges.Hence l had to fix my thinking and let the problems fix themselves.

Moreover,l seeked for advice from mentors and professionals on how l should approach life challenges and how to achieve desired outcomes.

Remember it is always perseverance, determination and a commitment to personal growth that you can ultimately achieve desired dreams.

This individual has consistently demonstrated their dedication, determination, and unwavering commitment, becoming a true source of inspiration for you.

In your essay, please explore the key aspects of their life, experiences, and actions that exemplify their consistent nature. Describe how their consistent approach has positively influenced and impacted not only their own life but also the lives of those around them. Reflect on specific instances or situations where their consistent behavior or mindset has motivated you to strive for excellence or overcome challenges in your own life.

Feel free to include personal anecdotes, observations, or conversations that highlight the impact this person's consistency has had on your growth and development. Additionally, analyze the qualities, values, or strategies that you believe contribute to their ability to maintain consistency over time.
I am excited to read your insightful essays and learn about the inspiring individuals who have demonstrated the power of consistency.
Best regards,

10/07/23, 13:29 - Nokutenda EWYL23E0274: Consistency became her break even point
Failure became her best friend at school,her colleagues had made it big in life but she was still at her worst.She became vulnerable to the taunts and insults from everyone around her just like a bin her life became a littering place if words.Tears filled her eyes,her heart broke into a million pieces,the little ray of light she had had been blown off,again she had failed dismally.She sighed abruptly for the millionth time and folded her result slip as she walked home.Let me take you through the journey of Zara,a girl who lived in Sandton village.

Even after the taunts and humiliation,Zara didn't give up on her dreams ,she kept trying.One fruitful day she helped Mr Alex,an old crippled man who had been isolated by the villagers,there began her journey to success.Mr Alex was a graduate but due to his condition he was rejected everywhere he went in search of internship till he became old,everyone in the village knew Zara's story including him,he knew.He offered to help her throughout her studies only if she could build self confidence inorder to combat limiting beliefs.Zara was a smart student but what she lacked was confidence, determination and dedication which Mr Alex had to implant in her.He kept giving her assignments to do and then she had to learn on time management and planning as she would be punished if she doesn't complete her assignments accurately.Zara had to work hard because this was her last chance,so she was told by her parents,she became committed and dedicated to her school work that when she wrote her final exams for the sixth time she knew it in her heart that this was her new start to a successful journey.Results came and she had passed with flying colours.She became the role model to every student at Blantae senior school that till date her story is used as an example.

She became a true source of inspiration to everyone as they traced back to all her life encounters.She had to come back to see the impact her life had instilled in other students and each time she looked back a wave of satisfaction was always a mark on her face.She then understood the sayings "failure is an opportunity to start again but this time more intelligently making success a state of mind" and "a true soldier is noticed by a million bruises"Her life was as difficult but she pulled through because of consistency.
