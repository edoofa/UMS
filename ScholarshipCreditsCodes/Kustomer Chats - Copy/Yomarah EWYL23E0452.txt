20/09/23, 17:20 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Yomarah!
How are you?
20/09/23, 17:20 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
20/09/23, 17:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - “I am a proud Edoofian”
20/09/23, 17:21 - Saloni Rastogi: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter

3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
20/09/23, 17:21 - Saloni Rastogi: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *09:30-11:00 AM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
20/09/23, 17:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
20/09/23, 17:23 - Yomarah EWYL23E0452: Yes ma'am
20/09/23, 18:00 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofians, Hope you are doing well!

21/09/23, 13:27 - Yomarah EWYL23E0452: I understood that freelancing is a dynamic & flexible career path that empowers individuals to work independently 

Freelancers become responsible for managing their own businesses . Their income can vary significantly from month to month.

If l become a freelancer l have the freedom to choose the type of work that l want to do
21/09/23, 13:48 - Saloni Rastogi: You've nailed the core concepts of freelancing! It's impressive to see that you understand how freelancing provides both dynamism and flexibility, granting individuals the power to work independently while shouldering the responsibilities of managing their own businesses, despite the income's variability. One significant perk you've highlighted is the freedom to select the type of work that aligns with your passions and expertise. To illustrate the growing prominence of freelancing, consider this: In the United States, the freelance workforce has surged to over 57 million individuals, demonstrating the thriving nature of this career path. 📈💼🌟

21/09/23, 14:43 - Yomarah EWYL23E0452: I'll have to approach my peers which could include my friends and relatives . I have to share information about the Edoofa scholarship program. This includes sharing of information including costs, and also the EWYL program.

04/10/23, 16:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofians,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning
