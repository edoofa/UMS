Q3.Harare Metropolitan Province
12/01/23, 23:04 - Saloni Rastogi: That's great Audrey!
12/01/23, 23:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Proud Edoofian, This week, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
12/01/23, 23:04 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead tomorrow.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him\/her for your School Head’s Contact.
12/01/23, 23:18 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: Unfortunately I do no have her contact details but I will surely have them tomorrow
13/01/23, 22:13 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

We will be discussing about the project tomorrow from 07:30 AM to 11:00 AM and exploring more interesting things tomorrow.

Hope to catch you here!
Till then keep following the daily ritual and work on your projects.
13/01/23, 22:21 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: Fine, thank you. That's  alright.
13/01/23, 22:21 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: I am a proud \"EDOOFIAN\".
14/01/23, 16:28 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: I am a proud \"EDOOFIAN\".
15/01/23, 21:38 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: I am a proud \"EDOOFIAN\".
16/01/23, 19:35 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: I am a proud \"EDOOFIAN\".
16/01/23, 19:35 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: \"Simplify\" is the first problem solving skill whereby one breaks down the problem into small sub sections where you focus on the cause,effect,result and solution for a problem.Numerical fluency this is when you focus on the numbers i.e of maybe the affected people or in shortage so as to apply a calculative solution that won't  fail again. The third problem solving strategy is the inverting notion. This allows one to think in reverse and get a solution on how to undo an already done damage and avoiding a problem.Studying the basics assists in the sense that one gets to identify the actual cause of a problem,how it could have been avoided ,how to rectify the mistake and ensure it does not recur in future.Lollapalooza Effects these come from long term causes and it's a contribution of many major factors and to fix it one needs to apply various big solutions however these effects take time to be dealt with completely.
16/01/23, 19:38 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: As part of your Saturday activity, I want you to share with us a problem that you encountered very recently and how did you Solve It. Did you use any strategy that was similar to what Munger has talked about?

Lately  I have been getting to work very late due to bad traffic on the roads and I took time to identify the causes and effects of this problem. The end result would have been me losing my job but after simplifying the problem i just realised that waking up and leaving home early is the best way to go so as to be on good terms with my employer.
16/01/23, 22:36 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings _my proud edoofian_!
How was your weekend?

 The ability to solve problems is a basic life skill and is essential to our day-to-day lives, at home, at school, and at work. We solve problems every day without really thinking about how we solve them. 
We talked about a situation and its probable ending.

In our session today:
1) how would you continue the situation as stated in the Weekend activity?
2) progress on the projects
16/01/23, 22:36 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, I want to remind you of three important things that often skips from our mind.
1) the daily ritual needs to be followed *only on the EWYL Line.*
2) responses to the weekend activity and Wednesday lesson won't be accepted if they are shared on the EWY Group, they need to be shared *only on the EWYL Line.*
3) any forms that you receive for the community building project, share them on the *EWYL Group.*
16/01/23, 22:36 - Saloni Rastogi: Moreover, we have a revised form for the community building project.
Please use this form only from tomorrow onwards, otherwise, they won't be counseled.

Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
17/01/23, 18:39 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: Thank you
17/01/23, 21:37 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Audrey!

Q3.Harare Metropolitan Province
17/01/23, 22:51 - Saloni Rastogi: Proud Edoofian, This week, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
17/01/23, 22:51 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know if you have Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead tomorrow.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him\/her for your School Head’s Contact.
17/01/23, 23:08 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: I do have her contact number.
17/01/23, 23:11 - Saloni Rastogi: Now, Once you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering professional communication, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized. 
r.
17/01/23, 23:11 - Saloni Rastogi: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
17/01/23, 23:12 - Saloni Rastogi: So, This is what the First message should look like:
17/01/23, 23:12 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Mr.\/Mrs *School Head Name*

I am *Your Name* and I am a student of _School Name_ school.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result\/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
17/01/23, 23:12 - Saloni Rastogi: Once he\/she confirms the timings, let me know.
17/01/23, 23:13 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: I promise.
17/01/23, 23:13 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: Okay ma'am.
18/01/23, 17:24 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: I am a proud Edoofian.
18/01/23, 17:26 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
18/01/23, 19:02 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Audrey!
How are you?
18/01/23, 19:02 - Saloni Rastogi: So, did you get any response from the headmaster?
18/01/23, 19:20 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: Fine thanks and yourself.
18/01/23, 19:20 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: Not yet will try and call her this today.
19/01/23, 16:40 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: It was seen through research that asking lots of questions improves interpersonal bonding but it is a necessity that one asks good questions to get good answers.One must know their purpose  and be able to ask real questions which require informative answers this also shows the effort put in to genuinely know more about the next person. Asking good enjoyable questions requires one to be a good listener so as to know the right approach to use with the person in question. Dale Carnegie some eighty years ago advised people to be good listeners if they wish to get fully informed on the people around them and this still applies in the modern day. Wise interruption saves one from going on and on giving unnecessary information.One shouldn't fear asking wrong questions thus ask more to get more valid information. To get real answers and your interlocutor's true opnion you must not ask already concluded questions as they seem manipulative and only serve as a tool for getting the answers you want and not the next person's point of view. One's questions must be put in some sort of a hierachy whereby general ones are muffled up with some factual questions this assists in getting a smooth flowing easy conversations. In conclusion I can say for one to be able to ask good questions a person just has to ask more and put a good tone sand structuring to the questions.
19/01/23, 16:40 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: I am a proud Edoofian.
19/01/23, 16:41 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: Greetings of the day Ms.Saloni.
19/01/23, 16:42 - Saloni Rastogi: - That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!

19/01/23, 22:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Audrey!
How are you?
19/01/23, 22:53 - Saloni Rastogi: What an elaborative understanding, impressive!
19/01/23, 22:56 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know if you called the headmaster today or not?
19/01/23, 23:03 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: I managed to contact her and she said she is out of town where whatsapl network is a hustle so she'll be back in town during the weekend. So whilst waiting on her return I have been trying to find other schools which maybe interested in joining Edoofa
20/01/23, 05:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for texting you late after the session's timing but I did not want to miss any updates from your end.
20/01/23, 05:43 - Saloni Rastogi: That would be great spirit, Audrey.
You can try searching for the schools in your province that is Harare or try reaching out to schools in other provinces.
20/01/23, 05:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers or neighbors if they have another School Head’s Contact.

20/01/23, 22:43 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: Fine thank you
20/01/23, 22:43 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: I'm  still searching will update you as soon as i get them.
21/01/23, 21:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

A college student named Rachel was unsure of what career path to pursue after graduation. She talked to several professionals in different fields, but none of them seemed to fit her interests and skills. One day, she had a conversation with a mentor who asked her the right questions, such as \"What are you passionate about?\" and \"What do you enjoy doing in your free time?\" Rachel realized that her true passion was writing and storytelling. She decided to pursue a career in journalism and landed a job at a top news outlet.

We gained knowledge on how to ask intelligent questions. I'd like you to share with us any two questions you'd like to ask yourself as part of your Saturday submission. The questions that you may have been hesitant to make, the questions that put you in a difficult situation, the inquiries that will have a significant impact on your career and future. For example:  1. What is the limit of my current capabilities and how can I push beyond them to continue learning and growing?\"
2. “How can I ensure that my actions align with my values and contribute to the greater good, rather than just maximizing my own success?\"

Looking forward to your response!
21/01/23, 21:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Please make a note of the following things:
1) No response will be accepted on the EWYL Group, it has to be done on the EWYL Line only.
2) I believe that you are aware that every morning you wake up, you need to follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' on the EWYL Line only. This ritual helps in keeping the family connected.
3) From now on, you have to reach out to me at your scheduled time of the session. In case you have not shared your activity\/lesson response to be within one hour of your scheduled session, I will mark that as a missed session and just to inform you that such a performance can go to the direct notice of the Academic Board of Edoofa under the defaulters' list. Make sure that you are punctual.

23/01/23, 21:05 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: - How do you intend to broaden this student community? In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.

I plan on doing so through spreading the good news all over and to every student and young adult who wishes to advance their education in a foreign nation where they can learn more on  various cultures and if so wishes adopt one of the cultures.
23/01/23, 21:16 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: In relation to my community schools project,I managed to meet with my former school's head and she raised her concerns as to how genuine the scholarship is  and she says before taking any steps forward she needs to first reasearch and verify the information I gave and discuss the subject with the teachers board before getting back to me with an approval.

The questions that you may have been hesitant to make, the questions that put you in a difficult situation, the inquiries that will have a significant impact on your career and future.

In our discussion today, we will talk about:
1) the two questions you will raise

Q1)Is my career choice the right one and am I  willing to do it all life long with joy and excitement?

Q2)Who am I and who do I want to become?
23/01/23, 22:32 - Saloni Rastogi: These questions have hit me hard and made me wonder about it.
23/01/23, 22:33 - Saloni Rastogi: So, tell me, Audrey, what do you dreamt to become when you were a kid and how has it changed now?
23/01/23, 23:11 - Audrey EWYL22E0747: Growing up I always wanted to become a surgeon and even my academic performance was in support of this but as time passed I realised I have a blood phobia and I  took some time out to really identify where my strength lies and it came to my realisation that I am a good comunicator and mostly i give sound advice to my peers and that is how I  came up with Psychology as a conclusion.
