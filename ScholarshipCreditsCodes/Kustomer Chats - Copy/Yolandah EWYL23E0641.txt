I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to let you know that Wednesday lesson is going to be a special one. We'll be delving into a captivating story that revolves around the themes of skill, hard work, and determination.

The moral of this story is a powerful one, and it's a lesson that we can carry with us throughout our lives: "Sometimes the truest treasures lay not in the allure of gold but in the craftsmanship and effort one invests in their work." This story will remind us of the value of dedication and the importance of striving for excellence in everything we do.

So, come prepared to listen, learn, and be inspired by this tale of determination and the rewards it can bring. We'll discuss the story, its characters, and the valuable lesson it imparts.

See you in our upcoming session, and let's explore the world of skill, hard work, and the true treasures that lie within our reach.

08/11/23, 14:56 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.
08/11/23, 14:56 - Aditi Kapoor: //////
08/11/23, 14:57 - Aditi Kapoor: .....
08/11/23, 15:55 - Yolandah EWYL23E0641: I think this Festival is essential because its bring family and friends together as they celebrate the festival

I am delighted to know more about this festival i only used to hear it without knowing what its means
08/11/23, 16:24 - Aditi Kapoor: You're absolutely right; festivals like Diwali are indeed essential in fostering strong family and social connections. They offer an occasion for loved ones to come together, celebrate, and share special moments.
Diwali is a beautiful and significant festival, often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It holds various meanings and traditions, but at its core, it symbolizes the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. The lighting of lamps and candles, the exchange of gifts, and the preparation of special dishes are some of the key customs associated with Diwali.
08/11/23, 16:26 - Yolandah EWYL23E0641: Diwali is celebrated in the month of November only?
08/11/23, 16:27 - Aditi Kapoor: Diwali doesn't have a fixed date in the Gregorian calendar, as its timing is determined by the Hindu lunar calendar. It typically falls between October and November, depending on the lunar cycle. The festival's date is determined by the lunar calendar, so it's essential to check the specific date each year to know when Diwali will be celebrated.
08/11/23, 16:27 - Yolandah EWYL23E0641: Oky i understand it
08/11/23, 16:28 - Aditi Kapoor: Yess!

15/11/23, 14:07 - Aditi Kapoor: Happy Wednesday! üåü
Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
