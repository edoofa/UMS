04/03/23, 19:02 - Jasmine Kaur: Sat Activity 4th March 2023

Hello, my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

In our Wednesday wisdom, we learned that the success story of NetFlorist highlights the significant role that innovation, customer-centricity, and hard work play in building a thriving business. The vision and dedication of the Bacher brothers have been instrumental in creating South Africa's largest online gifting company, and their commitment to innovation and customer service will likely drive NetFlorist's growth for years to come.

As part of your Saturday submission, I want you to answer the following questions in detail:

1. What are the key factors that have contributed to the success of NetFlorist, and how have the Bacher brothers' vision and dedication enabled them to build South Africa's largest online gifting company?
2. Additionally, what skills would you like to master in order to be successful in your professional journey?

You are required to submit your answers by your next session on Monday\/Tuesday.

Stay blessed!","transform":"

06/03/23, 21:02 - Jasmine Kaur: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”
06/03/23, 21:09 - Marshall EWYL20E0273: 1. Innovation, customer centricity and hard work.

06/03/23, 22:23 - Jasmine Kaur: my dear Proud Edoofian, first of all, I would like to congratulate you on being selected for the Social Media Project. I have been observing your active participation and interest in the EWYL program so I have chosen you to take part in a special project where you will learn how social media can benefit a company or an organization from the amount of customer engagement on their platforms, as well as positive reviews.
