The Great Rift Valley is like Mother Nature showing off her impressive artistic skills. Just breathtaking!

20/11/23, 13:12 - Kirsty EWYL23E0457: I did not manage to get in touch with any company. Some companies did not accept my request and some think that its a scam, what should i do üò≠
20/11/23, 13:16 - Saloni Rastogi: There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.

There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*

Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.

20/11/23, 13:35 - Saloni Rastogi: Try searching for them not on the company's page but normally.
20/11/23, 13:35 - Kirsty EWYL23E0457: Okay
20/11/23, 13:35 - Saloni Rastogi: Anything else Kirsty, on this project?

So, now I am going to share another audio file and we‚Äôll follow the same process- you ensure you don‚Äôt miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let‚Äôs get to it Kirsty!
