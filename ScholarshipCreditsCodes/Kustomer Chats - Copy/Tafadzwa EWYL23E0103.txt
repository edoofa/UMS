02/05/23, 12:23 - Tenzin: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.

Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell:

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges.
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
 3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
02/05/23, 12:33 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0103: This an interesting story 
It's true if we work together we can accomplish anything
03/05/23, 12:34 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0103: Good morning

21/08/23, 16:11 - Tenzin: May I know if you read the above-shared message?
21/08/23, 16:17 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0103: Yes I did I'm working on it
21/08/23, 16:22 - Tenzin: May I know when can you submit it?
21/08/23, 16:23 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0103: Around 1
21/08/23, 16:24 - Tenzin: But it is almost 1 now.
21/08/23, 16:32 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0103: Number 2

Once upon a time, there were two characters named **John** and **Maria**. John was from a wealthy family and had grown up with all the privileges that came with it. Maria, on the other hand, had grown up in poverty and had to work hard for everything she had.

When John and Maria first met, they didn't get along. John thought that Maria was lazy and didn't work hard enough, while Maria thought that John was arrogant and didn't understand what it was like to struggle.

However, over time, they began to see things from each other's perspectives. John realized that Maria worked hard every day just to make ends meet, while Maria realized that John had never had to worry about money or where his next meal was coming from.

As they learned more about each other's backgrounds and experiences, they began to appreciate each other's strengths and value each other's perspectives. They started working together on projects and found that their different backgrounds actually made them stronger as a team.

In the end, John and Maria became good friends and learned that by celebrating each other's differences, they could achieve great things together.
