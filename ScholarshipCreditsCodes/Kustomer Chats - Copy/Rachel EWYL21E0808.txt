10/10/22, 21:01 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!

13/10/22, 20:57 - Unknown: I noticed that you have not submitted the Saturday’s Activity yet. The deadline for that was Tuesday 6 PM but I gave you a leeway. Due to the delay, You also missed out on the Wednesday lesson that I was not able to share with you due to the pending last two submissions.

Today, At all costs, I would need the submission for the Last week's Saturday Activity.
I am sharing it below.

After that, I am sharing this week's Wednesday Lesson which you have to submit on Friday by 6 PM.

We can not allow ourselves to at a such mediocre pace.
If somehow, You have not received it, I am sharing it below again
13/10/22, 20:57 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.

20/10/22, 17:54 - Unknown: Yesterday because I was discussing the Testimonial Task with many students, I refrained from sharing the Wednesday Lesson because I thought it would be too much information for one session.
Therefore I am sharing the Wednesday Lesson with you Today.
Also, Since, I am sharing this one day late, I am extending the deadline to Saturday at 9 AM from Friday at 6 PM.
20/10/22, 17:54 - Unknown: Hello, My Proud Edoofian.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

He is also teaches us that just because we are successful it does not mean mean that we have to cut ties with people who molded us into what we are today, One can note that  hard work pays and believing that you have the potential to achieve what you want

We all know that \"History is Written by Winners\", but not everybody knows the discipline, dedication, sacrifices, time, and efforts put behind it.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the kind of mindset a winner possesses, and about the person who carved his way from the bottom to the top, and even beyond. The story of a basketball player turning into a lethal black mamba on the court, the habits he formed, and the mindset he forged, to turn into a winner, is inspirational and the most practical way to better oneself every single day. You will learn a lot of different things from this lesson, about the attitude, instinct, and character of a true all-round winner.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.
Deadline for Submission: Friday 9 PM

In this week's activity, you shall be putting this to use in your own working zone, by creating a list of targets\/goals, that you shall aim to achieve in a week. For a suggestion, you can start by setting up a number of Schools you would try connecting to in a week, the number of companies you shall reach out to, or the number of fellow community mates you would tell about edoofa.

This list, you shall share this with your mentors, and they would also keep a note of it. At the end of the week, you shall discuss with them, whether or not were you able to achieve the target, and what kind of mindset change did this activity lead you to.

Please make the submission using this form:

12/07/22, 18:17 - Rachel EWYL21E0808: A skill is the ability to do something well , and for one to be able to be given  the opportunity to work on projects  that can help to develop his or her working experience there by becoming employable in the twenty first century  job sector  he has to possess certain skills such as good communication skills, risk taking, punctuality, hard working and others. To begin with one must have good communication skills and when we are talking about good communication skills ,w are talking about the  ability to convince  the other part into agreeing to what you are saying or into giving you a positive response thus yielding you good results. Moving on one has to be resilient and hard working   because in everything that we do as individuals requires us to be hard working and resilient (the ability to face any challenges without braking or giving up) because in the line of work  we face different challenges whichever may force us to throw in the towel but an edoofian needs to be resilient so that he can produce good results.

12/07/22, 18:22 - Unknown: Rachel, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.
This way you will always be recognized by the Academics Board for new projects.

15/07/22, 17:36 - Rachel EWYL21E0808: The story of Patrice motsepe is something that is so  facinating and what so facinating about  his story is that he didn't allow his background to stop him from achieving what he wants instead he says it  molded him into being what he is today as  he was introduced to business by his father through selling liquor to miners. Moving on   the fact that he is a risk taker  is something that I can  applaud him for because he bought a gold company  and that company was not producing more but he took the risk of buying it even if he didn't know whether it was going to bring him profit or not , but from that risk he paved his way into the mining sector . Therefore  from his ability to be a risk taker l learnt that for one to be successful one must be willing to take risks.  In addition  l was also facinated by the fact that he didn't only focus on mining  but he exposed himself  to many different types of businesses  as a result he has shares from other companies as well
15/07/22, 17:40 - Rachel EWYL21E0808: When I first enrolled with edoofa l was just Rachel but after the sessions that we had and keep on doing l can see that there is a change that is happening in my life  as l am learning more life skills and that makes me feel proud to be part of the edoofa family
15/07/22, 18:40 - Unknown: I am very happy after going through your response. ?
Proud Edoofians, These are the footsteps that we have to follow. The traits that he gained and possessed are not something that could be taught in schools\/ universities. That is why our head coach, Ms. Davi, tries that through every lesson you are able to get one step closer towards gaining these traits and making your career sucessful.
15/07/22, 18:41 - Unknown: I am very glad to hear that, Rachel.

◼️Make sure that you follow the Proud Edoofian ritual (Even on Sunday?)
◼️Keep an eye on the Saturday Activity that will be shared in your batch group
◼️Also, If you haven't submitted the Wednesday Lesson yet, Please make sure that you submit it as soon as possible.
◼️I would like to you work diligently on the EWYL Projects and submit your Project Progress Form in our next scheduled session.

I wish you a blessed and a joyful weekend ahead✨
