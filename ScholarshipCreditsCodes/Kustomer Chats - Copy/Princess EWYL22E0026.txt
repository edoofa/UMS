12/07/22, 18:27 - Princess EWYL22E0026: I'm a proud edoofian
12/07/22, 18:28 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

Happy new week my proud Edoofian! How are you doing today?
13/07/22, 17:46 - Unknown: Princess, did you work on the Weekend activity? 
It was an interesting one and related to the EWYL projects and really fascinated me.
13/07/22, 17:46 - Unknown: Please list the skills that are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring in a lot of learning.
13/07/22, 18:30 - Princess EWYL22E0026: I didn't do it 
I'm doing my driver's lessons
13/07/22, 18:38 - Unknown: I understand that Princess. I remember when I had my first driving lessons years ago. It is indeed crucial to gain this skill, you see how it comes with constant practice?
13/07/22, 19:15 - Princess EWYL22E0026: Yes but it's hard at the beginning
14/07/22, 01:45 - Unknown: Great Princess.

Greeting of the day my proud edoofian! How are you doing?
14/07/22, 23:22 - Unknown: Did you work on the Wednesday wisdom task I shared with you yesterday Princess?

Personally I found it very interesting as it discussed the life and struggles of Patrice, an African Billionaire and I believe my students should take inspiration from him.
15/07/22, 17:42 - Unknown: Hello Princess, how are you doing?
15/07/22, 17:42 - Unknown: Did you read my messages? I was expecting you to respond.
25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

Good day my proud Edoofian!! How are you today?
04/08/22, 19:05 - Unknown: Did you read the super interesting story of 19 year old Gilbert Eugene Peters from Zimbabwe that I shared with you yesterday?

I am sure you must have found his life inspiring and learnt a few things from it.
04/08/22, 19:31 - Princess EWYL22E0026: I'm okay
04/08/22, 19:32 - Princess EWYL22E0026: Yes I did
04/08/22, 21:00 - Unknown: So now please share what you learnt from it with me as well Princess.
04/08/22, 21:13 - Princess EWYL22E0026: That you always have to work hard to achieve what you want in life and you need to trust yourself that you can do it
04/08/22, 22:26 - Unknown: Good to read your understanding of the lesson Princess. The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years. The price is knowing that time is working on your side even when the results don’t show it, yet.
04/08/22, 22:30 - Princess EWYL22E0026: Yes
05/08/22, 00:29 - Unknown: You see a lack of consistency keeps ordinary people from achieving extraordinary results. Excelling at the small choices that compound over time perpetually leaves you in favorable circumstances. No matter what happens in the world, you’re never in a position where you are forced into a bad decision.
05/08/22, 00:55 - Princess EWYL22E0026: Yes true
05/08/22, 02:00 - Unknown: So in other words success is a product of what ideas we create and choices we make in our everyday life.

This is why I share the lessons and activities with you on a daily basis. Right?
05/08/22, 02:07 - Princess EWYL22E0026: Okay
05/08/22, 19:23 - Unknown: Good day Princess, how are you doing?

11/08/22, 22:07 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
