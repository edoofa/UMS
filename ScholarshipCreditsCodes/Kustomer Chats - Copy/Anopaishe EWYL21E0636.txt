04/08/22, 20:50 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

 Upon completion of the program, he got a certificate.\r
His first job ever was as an Internet Café Assistant. This was just after completing his Ordinary Level education. In\r
addition to that, he was working part-time as a Home Satellite Dish Installer. This part-time hustle grew to a point\r
where he brought in 2 of his buddies to help out. This would later scale to a point where they installed home\r
satellites for over 2000 homes. This all happened when he was aged 19 and essentially marked the birth of his\r
entrepreneurial journey.

The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years. The price is knowing that time is working on your side even when the results don’t show it... yet.

21/07/22, 14:15 - Anopaishe EWYL21E0636: I learned that as Ms Davi said , Nearly all dissatisfaction and failure in life are caused by the propensity to place the blame somewhere else.\r
How It’s Easy to Blame Others because everybody has a choice where she mentioned certain scenarios such as one can blame shortcomings on the weather, a bad horoscope, or that\r
it’s a leap year.  She later on laid it bare for us by saying  The truth is, when folks deflect responsibility and cast blame, it serves as\r
nothing more than a crutch and a reason to stop trying.
This is the part that really revolutionaries the way I thought , and reacted to bad things that happen ,I sometimes try by sal means to not take the blame for for it.
 Ms Davi layer pointed out that This results in  ultimately losing faith in\roneself and ones abilities –– and making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. That failure is inevitable.
She later brought contrast that ,\r
Successful people, on the other hand, don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something.
*They accept\rpersonal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it. 
*They also know that being\runwilling to make the effort is a losing game. In fact, those who say, “I can’t” and “I don’t want to” trigger the same\r
results.
_ It is important to note — even though you may be making an effort today, things may not be going your\r
way. That’s because you may be paying a price for years of neglect. But that shouldn’t deter you from making the\reffort now
*The truth is, it takes many years to become an overnight success.
I'm summation, \r
The bottom line is, that if you want to achieve something in life, get to work. Things don’t happen magically. \ryou have to make things happen. So, be positive. Stay focused. And remain determined. If you look into the mirror and\rdon’t like what you see … don’t blame the mirror. Successful people accept responsibility for their destiny

It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

Greeting of the day, my proud Edoofian! How are you doing?
21/07/22, 18:18 - Unknown: Good to read your response on this lesson Anopaishe! I am glad that you were able to understand the crux of that which is that successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it
