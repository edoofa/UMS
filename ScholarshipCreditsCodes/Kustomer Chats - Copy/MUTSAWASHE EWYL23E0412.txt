20/09/23, 16:00 - MUTSAWASHE EWYL23E0412: Their school fees is more than a $100 so I am a bit more confident on their ability to afford paying for their children's higher education

20/09/23, 16:02 - MUTSAWASHE EWYL23E0412: The headmaster has seen this as a good initiative. But unfortunately he has not been available lately. It myt be because of their poor network in that part of the country or the busy schedule as candidates are about to write soon
20/09/23, 16:07 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, I understand but please try to get the school form filled as soon as possibel.

04/10/23, 13:57 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofians,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning
