13/08/22, 19:40 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

25/08/22, 20:43 - Unknown: The Class of 2022, as well as new graduate and professional students, have settled in but many are probably wondering what the next few years holds for them with Edoofa. One key element of Orientation is, as its name implies, getting students going in the right direction. Part of that is feeling welcomed and at home here on campus. Part is learning how to put your best foot forward, regardless of your backgrounds and previous experiences.

We are planning a pre-orientation session because the orientation programme will now take place in the first few weeks of September. This session will be led by Ms. Davi, who will inform you of a few crucial details and have a wonderful surprise in store for everyone of you.

The pre-orientation will take place through Google meet on Friday, 26th August, 7:30 PM IST

Kindly join 10 minutes in advance as the session will start exactly at 7:30 PM and students joining post 7:30 PM will not be allowed to join.

12/07/22, 19:43 - Mercy EWYL21E0769: Being in business is something which every student wants to be in. At school level one is given school projects which means dealing with real-world problems and bringing in profit for the company. There are certain skills which are required for one to participate in projects and attain higher scholarship credits. These include courage,obedience,hard-working,honest,respect and team work. Courage is important because if one lacks that nothing can work out and it will also take away self-confidence. Obedience comes from listening to the instructions and also being upto date with any specific project given. Hard working is important because it reduces work load and also it can attract many business project to you. Lastly team work is something which most students find it difficult to do. Doing team work can reduce the work and also it helps to find solutions very fast compared being alone.
12/07/22, 20:30 - Unknown: Mercy, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.
This way you will always be recognized by the Academics Board for new projects.

15/07/22, 18:05 - Mercy EWYL21E0769: It is not in my nature to miss the Wednesday Activities because they are really motivational and boosts ones confidence
15/07/22, 18:05 - Mercy EWYL21E0769: Hello, My Proud Edoofians ?
I hope you all are doing fine. 

It's time for *Wednesday Wisdom*, and this week we're going to learn how the son of a former teacher in an African school made over _$1 billion dollars_. You did read it correctly. ?

When I read the lesson, I personally learned a lot. In the lecture, some of the top success secrets are revealed.

Be sure to thoroughly read the PDF document, and if you choose, you can note down things that you liked or be inspired by. 

Please make sure that you share your understanding of the above document and audio with me on the *EWYL DEDICATED LINE* in about _100-150_ words by *FRIDAY 3 PM*

Happy studying! ?
15/07/22, 18:36 - Mercy EWYL21E0769: Good morning sir\/madam
My name is Mercy and am a benefitting student from Edoofa Scholarship. Edoofa is an organization which offers 50%-100% scholarships to African students mostly. This organization helps to reduce the expensive fees from the parents. My main aim of contacting is to explain about projects. Every student is suppose to attain scholarship credits through scoring higher points in the given projects. As part of my project am tasked to get in touch with school heads and explain to them the benefits of the Edoofa and also encourage the students to join the organization through my Directors.
Am looking forward to hear from you.Thank you and have a great day
15/07/22, 18:54 - Mercy EWYL21E0769: In the story of Patrice l learnt that if you have a passion with something ,try until you succeed. Even if the world see no light just continue sailing until you reach your destination. I also learnt that giving up is not good as no one knows what tomorrow holds,things might change overnight. I was inspired by the fact that he became the first black person to partner with whites during the colonization era. He is an inspiration to the Africans and it also made me want to work hard and achieve my goals in the same manner
15/07/22, 19:28 - Unknown: I am very happy after going through your response. ?
Proud Edoofians, These are the footsteps that we have to follow. The traits that he gained and possessed are not something that could be taught in schools\/ universities. That is why our head coach, Ms. Davi, tries that through every lesson you are able to get one step closer towards gaining these traits and making your career sucessful.
15/07/22, 19:28 - Unknown: Let me now go through the message, Mercy
15/07/22, 19:30 - Unknown: Now Can you tell me what is wrong with this kind of communication?
15/07/22, 19:48 - Mercy EWYL21E0769: Nothing is wrong sir
15/07/22, 20:25 - Unknown: Well, the answer lies in the way you keep up the conversation. 
Let us suppose if I am reaching out to you for the very first time, do I share everything about the EWYL projects and introduce myself in a blunt manner, or do I first introduce myself, ask you about your availability and then keep the conversation interactive while explaining the projects?
15/07/22, 20:28 - Mercy EWYL21E0769: Okay now get the sense
15/07/22, 20:31 - Unknown: So, May I know how would you like to start now?
15/07/22, 20:55 - Mercy EWYL21E0769: Start by introducing myself and create a good environment and ask for availability then continue
15/07/22, 21:32 - Unknown: Yes, You are right!
Can you please share a few sample messages with me?

17/07/22, 19:56 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
