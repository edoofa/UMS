17/04/23, 12:57 - Jasmine Kaur: Let me go through it Katendi
17/04/23, 13:00 - Katendi EWYL22E1283: ok
17/04/23, 13:00 - Jasmine Kaur: Thank you for sharing your thoughts on ecopreneurship and the prevailing environmental problem of waste disposal. It is important to recognize the impact that waste can have on our environment and the steps that can be taken to mitigate it. 
The solutions you mentioned, such as incineration, composting, sanitary landfilling, and pyrolysis, are all valid ways of managing waste.
17/04/23, 13:01 - Jasmine Kaur: Overall, I feel that ecopreneurship offers a promising approach to addressing environmental challenges while creating economic opportunities. By incorporating sustainability principles into business practices, ecopreneurs can help to build a more resilient and equitable future for generations to come.
17/04/23, 13:01 - Katendi EWYL22E1283: I agree.
17/04/23, 13:03 - Jasmine Kaur: So, were you able to attend the webinar Katendi?
17/04/23, 13:04 - Katendi EWYL22E1283: Yes i was..it was very interesting and inspirational.
17/04/23, 13:19 - Jasmine Kaur: That's great. I would love to hear what you collected from the webinar and also suggest the topic you want that our future webinar should be based on.
17/04/23, 13:27 - Katendi EWYL22E1283: I learnt that success is a process of working through each step in order to reach the next one.
Each step we take motivates and inspires us to keep going.
And through our success journey it is important that we have the right mindset,initiative and drive.
It is important that we are able to focus,listenand also manage our emotions.
We need to portray humility,consistency,discipline anf determination.
We must be able to make mistakes and learn from them.To sacrifice certain things and work extremely hard to achieve our goals.
17/04/23, 13:29 - Katendi EWYL22E1283: I suggest the topic Personal Development
17/04/23, 13:30 - Jasmine Kaur: Dear, I am not talking about this one. Last week's activity was based on ecopreneurship.
17/04/23, 13:36 - Katendi EWYL22E1283: From your message...you clearly stated from the webinar.
17/04/23, 13:39 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, pardon me Katendi.
That's a great perspective on what it takes to achieve success! It's true that success is not just about reaching the end goal, but also about the journey and the process that gets us there. Having the right mindset, initiative, and drive are certainly important qualities to cultivate. And being able to focus, listen, and manage emotions are skills that can help us navigate through challenges and setbacks along the way.
17/04/23, 13:40 - Jasmine Kaur: Overall, it sounds like you have gathered a good understanding of what it takes to achieve success. Keep working hard, stay focused, and keep learning and growing along the way!
17/04/23, 13:41 - Katendi EWYL22E1283: Thank you.....i surely will.

27/04/23, 21:04 - Katendi EWYL22E1283: From the document i learnt:
One cause of failire is the lack of decision.Hill here is encouraging us to make quick and definate decisions.
27/04/23, 21:05 - Katendi EWYL22E1283: Secondly is persistence.....i liked the part where he says how easily one is able to persist depends on how intense their desire is....i learnt that for one to be persistent in a particular area there must be a desire...a drive
27/04/23, 21:07 - Katendi EWYL22E1283: I understood that the subconscious mind can only be directed through the process of habit and is more receptive to thoughts
27/04/23, 21:08 - Katendi EWYL22E1283: I also liked the way he describes the sixth sense....he refers to this sense as the creative imagination
