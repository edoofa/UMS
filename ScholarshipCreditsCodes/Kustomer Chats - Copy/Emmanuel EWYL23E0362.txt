I hope you are doing really well.
So, are you ready to start our session?
21/09/23, 15:39 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0362: SURE
21/09/23, 15:39 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0362: How are you miss Aditi
21/09/23, 15:42 - Aditi Kapoor: I am well.
Thanks for asking.
21/09/23, 15:44 - Aditi Kapoor: First off Emmanuel, I would like to ask why didn't you follow your daily ritual, as you didn't follow it I wasn't able to connect with you and hence couldn't send the Wednesday Lesson.
21/09/23, 15:47 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0362: I didn't have my phone yesterday.
21/09/23, 15:48 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, I understand.
21/09/23, 15:50 - Aditi Kapoor: So Emmanuel would you like to share your project updates with me, may I know if you are facing any challenges?
21/09/23, 15:53 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0362: Yah the might challenge is data, the terriffs have been rised and  it is not going so easy to buy those bundles\]
21/09/23, 15:57 - Aditi Kapoor: I understand the challenge with increased data tariffs; it can be frustrating. In the meantime, try to make the most of any available Wi-Fi connections or consider exploring options for more cost-effective data plans when possible.
21/09/23, 16:02 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0362: Yeah i understand but Zimbabwe is a  little bit different doesn't have those free wi-fi everywhere but i will try to normalize my party-time and buy data.
21/09/23, 16:03 - Aditi Kapoor: That would be appreciated because I hope that you know that your scholarship credits depend on the work you do in these projects.
21/09/23, 16:04 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0362: yes i understand
21/09/23, 16:05 - Aditi Kapoor: So can you please tell me your plan of action for these projects?

21/09/23, 16:28 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes that would be appreciated!

21/09/23, 16:49 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, but I also told you that the Corporate Alliance project is currently on hold as we have a lot of companies at our hand currently.
21/09/23, 16:51 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0362: okay i understand
21/09/23, 16:53 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, so very quickly can you brief me about the other 2 projects?
21/09/23, 16:57 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0362: A cooperative alliance refers to a collaborative partnership or agreement between individuals, groups, or organizations to work together towards a common goal. It involves pooling resources, knowledge, and efforts to achieve mutual benefits and shared objectives.
21/09/23, 17:01 - Aditi Kapoor: What about the other projects?
21/09/23, 17:01 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0362: Community building refers to the process of creating a positive and inclusive environment within an educational setting. It involves fostering connections, promoting collaboration, and cultivating a sense of belonging among students.
21/09/23, 17:02 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0362: A cooperative alliance among students can be seen as a group of individuals who come together to support each other academically. They may form study groups, participate in group projects, or engage in collaborative learning activities. By working together, students can share ideas, exchange information, and help one another understand and grasp complex concepts.
21/09/23, 17:03 - Aditi Kapoor: Correct!
21/09/23, 17:03 - Aditi Kapoor: That concludes my input for today!
Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
