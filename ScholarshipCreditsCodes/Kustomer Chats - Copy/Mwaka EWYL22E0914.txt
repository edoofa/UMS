I am a proud edoofian
30/01/23, 21:18 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
30/01/23, 21:20 - Unknown: Awesome!
30/01/23, 21:21 - Unknown: Now let us start with the African School Reforms project.
30/01/23, 21:22 - Mwaka EWYL22E0914: Alright great
30/01/23, 21:23 - Mwaka EWYL22E0914: Yes please
30/01/23, 21:23 - Unknown: As discussed before, In Today’s session, We will be discussing *How we can improve our performance on the African School Education Reform Mission Project*.

Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located?
30/01/23, 21:27 - Mwaka EWYL22E0914: Before I answer this I’d like to confirm if this applies to my former high school or the university I’m currently at
30/01/23, 21:48 - Unknown: Both actually, I hope you can reach out to your previous school too right?
30/01/23, 21:52 - Mwaka EWYL22E0914: Well I found out about Edoofa from my previous school so my former school is already connected to Edoofa
30/01/23, 21:53 - Unknown: That's great!
30/01/23, 21:55 - Unknown: Proud Edoofian, this week, I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well..
30/01/23, 22:01 - Mwaka EWYL22E0914: Alright then I’d have to locate other schools in my area
30/01/23, 22:03 - Unknown: Yes, and can you name the province where your school is located?
30/01/23, 22:03 - Mwaka EWYL22E0914: Copperbelt province
30/01/23, 22:06 - Unknown: Great! May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead tomorrow.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him\/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
30/01/23, 22:18 - Mwaka EWYL22E0914: I am currently at a university.. I could get the dean of student’s email address
30/01/23, 22:32 - Unknown: Oh, so are you enrolled for a degree course now\/
30/01/23, 23:03 - Mwaka EWYL22E0914: Yes I am
30/01/23, 23:09 - Unknown: Awesome, now can you share with me your study plans in India and what are you currently pursuing?
30/01/23, 23:10 - Mwaka EWYL22E0914: I’m currently pursuing a Bachelors degree in mathematics.
I’d like to pursue MSc Statistics in India
30/01/23, 23:12 - Unknown: That is awesome Mwaka!
30/01/23, 23:12 - Unknown: So how are the classes going for you now?
30/01/23, 23:19 - Mwaka EWYL22E0914: They are going great.. a little exhausting but great
30/01/23, 23:24 - Unknown: Alright, so tell me which project do you think is most right for you?
30/01/23, 23:30 - Mwaka EWYL22E0914: All the other projects are just except the one where I have to reach out to high schools that would be a bit more challenging.
30/01/23, 23:31 - Mwaka EWYL22E0914: Most of the people in my reach would be those that want to pursue masters programs
30/01/23, 23:32 - Unknown: Yes I can see that which is why I was about to suggest to you if you can instead reach out to your fellow juniors instead with the Community Building Program.
30/01/23, 23:43 - Mwaka EWYL22E0914: Exactly
30/01/23, 23:57 - Unknown: Awesome! So you can start by creating a whatsapp group and there you can add your fellow juniors who are now in 11th or 12th Standard and make them aware of the Edoofa scholarship program. Can you do that Mwaka?
31/01/23, 00:19 - Unknown: Oh, so you do not have any contact of your juniors?
31/01/23, 00:20 - Mwaka EWYL22E0914: No I do not

01/02/23, 19:38 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

Happy Learning!
