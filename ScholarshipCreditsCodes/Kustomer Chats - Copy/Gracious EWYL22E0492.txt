After reading through the lesson, you know I got reminded of one quote by Jack Welch. It says,

*Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others.*

I believe that since you are my Community Building project Student representative, you are the one who performs brilliantly in the project and become a leading example for other students as well.

Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

02/03/23, 23:01 - Saloni Rastogi: I completely agree with you and I believe experiences make us feel alive: there are times when we live our lives and slowly let them pass us by. This can happen when you stick to the same routine day and night without doing anything new. Going through life in the same 'state' can be tedious, but an unforgettable experience will awaken your mind and soul.
02/03/23, 23:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Innovation is the reflection of change and solution in respect of some problems in Life. Innovations by any means are basically the solutions to our daily life problems
02/03/23, 23:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, keep the information solely on one group. Don't create another group.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

In today's session, we will discuss:
1) Weekend activity
2) Projects
06/03/23, 22:52 - Gracious EWYL22E0492: *Weekend activity* 
The key factors that contributed to the success of Netflorish are hard work , innovation and customer centricity.Netflorish used the internet as a platform for online shopping .Due to the new technology people now  want to use the easy and convinient way of on delivery service.Also another way that has contributed to the success of Netflorish is customer centricity.it offers a wide range of products because customers have different taste and preference so it has been satisfying all it's customers.Moreover hardwork ha sled to Netflorish success ,it has won a lot of awards including the South Africa E - commerce award for best florist in 2019 which shows that it has been working very hard.
2.The skills l want to master to be professional from the lesson is Innovation.it increase competition at work by offering high quality products more efficiently at a lower cost .Also the business is able to keep up with charges in your industry.customer centricity is beneficial in the long run some of the benefits are it helps create customer loyalty.The customers keep coming of they find that you understand their needs and meets their expectations consistently.Also hard work always pays off so to be professional you need to work hard that's the other skill l need to master .
06/03/23, 23:07 - Saloni Rastogi: You know the opinions of both the question will completely differ with students but one thing that is common is that they strive to move ahead in life and take this motivation to next level. I have heard one quote on it, let me share it with you:
''One of the best ways to achieve career success is to keep assessing your performance. Don't wait for your annual appraisal – do it yourself. An ideal way to do this would be to identify quantifiable goals and set a timeline for achieving them. Start with setting short-term goals when you're new to a job.''

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

Happy learning and smiling!
15/12/22, 06:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Some of my students have formed a WhatsApp group where they:
First, keep sharing the link of the group in their family groups, class groups, and school groups, with the children who stay nearby, and, try to circulate all around.
Second, once new people get added to the group, they are told about Edoofa and it the perks of being associated with it.
third, they share the community building form with them and then children fill the form and share it on the group.

What do you think about this?
15/12/22, 06:30 - Saloni Rastogi: This is for the community building project.

17/12/22, 03:36 - Gracious EWYL22E0492: Secret Santa is a Christmas tradition in which members of a group or community are randomly assigned a person to whom they give a gift.  The identity of the gift giver is to remain a secret and should not be revealed.It's a holiday classic where the guessing is as much a part of the fun as receiving the gift and people are able to bond and show some love to their loved ones.
17/12/22, 03:36 - Gracious EWYL22E0492: I can start now if it's possible
17/12/22, 03:40 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me share something that I read on Christmas by Ruth Carter Stapleton:

19/12/22, 04:29 - Gracious EWYL22E0492: The Secret santa is given a wish list of gift ideas to choose from to give to their chosen giftee.It is a Holiday classic where the guessing is as much a part of the fun as receiving the gift . Members of a group of friends , family or coworkers draw random names to become someone's Secret santa.With secret santa,you actually get to go out and shop for the person whose name you picked . Since you know who's going to get your gift,you can buy something with them in mind. It's a personal gift -giving experience for both of us .This Christmas holiday I'm going to be my twin sister  Gorden Gachata's secret santa . I'm going to give her a colorful Airpod case, novelty socks and skincare sets.my sister has a mania for music that's why I'm planning to buy her a pair of colorful Airpods.Also she is asthetician ,simply simple she can't live without skincare products ,she always makes time for her skin no matter what that's why l have chosen her skincare set as a gift .lastly this is a rainy season that's why l have chosen her novelty socks because in rainy season she always stays indoors because she is allergic to rain ,so when she is at home she is always with her socks on that's why l have chosen her comfortable novelty socks.

09/01/23, 21:23 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are well.

''Sell me this pen.''
It is a very prominent sales statement kept in front of various upcoming leaders.
This weekend's activity was basically asking you how would you answer the same in the most creative and unique manner.

In today's session:
1) we will discuss your pitch to sell a pen to me in the most unique and creative manner
2) progress on the project chosen
3) previous Wednesday's lesson understanding
09/01/23, 21:48 - Gracious EWYL22E0492: Noted
09/01/23, 21:55 - Saloni Rastogi: Can I have your views on the Wednesday wisdom as well as the weekend activity, please?
09/01/23, 22:12 - Gracious EWYL22E0492: Cialdini's 6 Principles of Influence are reciprocity, commitment and consistency, consensus or social proof, authority, liking and scarcity.
  Reciprocity Simply put, people are obliged to give back to others the form of a behavior, gift, or service that they have received first. By understanding these rules you can use them to persuade and influence others in the business environment.
09/01/23, 22:31 - Saloni Rastogi: Your understanding is very impressive Gracious!
What I understood from the lesson is that Understanding the art of persuasion can not only help you learn how to influence others; it can also make you more aware of the techniques others might use to try and change your beliefs and behaviors.
09/01/23, 22:36 - Gracious EWYL22E0492: Sure ,if you could just quickly sign this refund slip ,l can go about getting you back your money on the pen you bought last .This pen is such a long - lasting ink and a durable nib .Madam you are welcome to use it for a week for free .After that you'll come back and see if the pen has met your needs if it hasn't , I'm prepared to offer you a range of other pens .
09/01/23, 22:54 - Saloni Rastogi: That's a smart one but may I know why did you try to sell it for free in first place?
09/01/23, 23:04 - Gracious EWYL22E0492: To attract new customers and introduce people to my business and products and build loyalty amongst customers
10/01/23, 06:46 - Gracious EWYL22E0492: Evening Ms Saloni can l start working on the second project
10/01/23, 18:51 - Gracious EWYL22E0492: I'm a proud Edoofian
10/01/23, 18:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
