26/06/23, 11:40 - Anesu EWYL22E1257: Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's story is one that is based  on this coat according to me " no guts no glory no legends no story" and also on proper strategizing , at the same time following religiously the strategy. In her story it was clear that in life things will never go the way you want them to but either way if you have the courage to navigate through the winds of negativity, the winds of positivity will eventually come to your aid. However for one to be courageous and more situation sensitive in challenging times one needs knowledge, this is where education plays an important role in our everyday lives and struggles. Leaders are born out of pressure and hardships and the best suited to sit on the throne will rise to the occasion nonetheless. However integrity is the corner stone that will either keep you on top or bring you down depending on how you decide to honor it. I didn't understand much but I guess this much I did.
26/06/23, 19:41 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Afternoon Anesu
I hope you are doing well. 
May I know that are you aware of your session timings?
26/06/23, 20:19 - Anesu EWYL22E1257: Good afternoon mam ,

02/07/23, 00:16 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self‚Äîthe person you aspire to be‚Äîand consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!
02/07/23, 00:17 - Jasmine Kaur: Kindly come prepared with the document and think of one extra curricular activity that you are good at.
02/07/23, 00:17 - Jasmine Kaur: Now I will see you in the session tomorrow. Take Care
02/07/23, 00:54 - Anesu EWYL22E1257: Thank you mam I will be present with the document tomorrow as well as the activity
02/07/23, 11:38 - Anesu EWYL22E1257: *My story of transformation*

Story telling, one thing I'm not good at but yes I will try. This is my ideal self , whenever I don't know how to get something started despite actually wanting to then immediately I tell myself I'm bad at it and won't be able to do it. Typical mindset right I mean obviously you can't know everything without being taught right but it doesn't mean you bad at it if you don't know it right. And now this is the person I aspire to be, one who accepts that he doesn't know but if he is to be taught that skill then he will turn into a genius. This version of myself is centralized by this short phrase, " negativity never , positivity forever".
Filling one's mind with the it's possible or it can be done mindset even when things seem impossible brings about hope and the energy to soldier on.

Now this road from being a shortsighted person to being a visionary won't be easy. There are bad habits that close the doors of betterment or those that ensure you are a second late from grabbing a certain opportunity. One these habits is wrong use of the internet, getting carried away with unworthy stuff which eventually takes up all my time leaving me with none to work on the important things.I realize maybe some habits are just born with us but they ruin our present nonetheless, which is overwhelming them becomes a thing of paramount importance. Such habits are now deep  rooted in me that it won't be easy to get rid of them and if someone referred to them as addiction then I wouldn't mind at all because even I feel the same. I feel bad after doing the act but before doing it I feel motivated to do it in the name of happiness, but if the happiness is that genuine why does it disappear after the act then , why does shame and resentment for one's self replace the excitement. It means one thing only, everything that's bad has a tempting beautiful side which is always temporary hence it's now up to one's self to look towards the outcome not the beginning in order to overcome bad habits. The only way to overcome these habits is to fortify your mind against them , replacing them with good ones instead and praying your way through it all. Look past the addiction, there is a better you inside and likewise a better me. Don't look back when you know redemption is where you headed not where you coming from.

Amongst the bad habits there will be success yes but maybe without the habits it would be more than it is now. Since childhood my growth has always been driven by situations what I experience and what I would love to experience, how I live and how I would love to live. All these made me rise to the peak of my abilities when academic stuff is concerned and my A level certificate proved the same as I took up sciences i.e Maths physics chemistry and computer science and scored 18 points. However I could have done better if some addictive behaviors hadn't taken some of my time. A lot of people now from my former school say we want to copy his style of working so as to attain as much as he did or even more than he did and that makes feel honored. I believe influencing those around you is easy but influencing them to do the right thing is always difficult but not impossible right! ü§ó

03/07/23, 16:51 - Jasmine Kaur: Now, While I go through your activity. Quickly share an update regarding

1. Extra Curricular Activity
2. Community Building Project
3. African School Education Reform Mission Project
03/07/23, 16:59 - Anesu EWYL22E1257: Sure mam lemme do that
03/07/23, 17:05 - Anesu EWYL22E1257: For extra curricular activities I have been working on a song but it's not completed yet but as the process continues everything will fall into place
03/07/23, 17:06 - Anesu EWYL22E1257: As for project 2 and 3 I have been working on them but there isn't a feasible update yet but I'm trying my very best
03/07/23, 17:18 - Jasmine Kaur: It's admirable to see your self-awareness and your aspiration to become a person who embraces a positive mindset and seeks continuous growth.

Your realization that labeling yourself as "bad" at something simply because you don't know it yet is a common mindset many people face. It's important to remember that not knowing something doesn't make you inherently bad or incapable. By shifting your perspective and adopting a growth mindset, you open yourself up to the possibility of learning and becoming skilled in areas that were once unfamiliar to you. Embracing the phrase "negativity never, positivity forever" is a powerful mantra that can guide you in pursuing your goals with optimism and determination.
03/07/23, 17:18 - Jasmine Kaur: Great, Now let's wrap up for the day. I wish you ALL THE BEST! I will see you in the next session now. We will discuss the projects in the next session Anesu

Have a nice day!

06/07/23, 16:36 - Anesu EWYL22E1257: Form the Wednesday wisdom I managed to acquire some of my own and I would like to take this opportunity to share the same with you,

I have understood that consistency can prove to be quite a power full tool in shaping one's life , and I would love to add something which wasn't mentioned but I believe it's important, one should always try to be consistent about the good habits rather than the bad ones as misinterpretation if this trait can shape one's life wrongly, from the article I read from a proud Edoofian he said character is destiny and I truly agree with him on that.
Consistency is the one tool that can ensure one's progress over time even when it seems pointless to keep trying, builds credibility and reliability in the eyes of your fellow mates as they begin to trust not only your words but your actions as well , it can instil good habits that benefit the body as well as the mind , brings about the power to keep pushing against the odds, and most importantly consistency strengthens bonds both professionally and socially...
Thank you ü´°

06/07/23, 16:45 - Anesu EWYL22E1257: Good afternoon mam
06/07/23, 16:45 - Jasmine Kaur: You rightly pointed out the importance of being consistent with good habits rather than bad ones. Consistency, when directed towards positive behaviors and actions, can have a profound impact on shaping one's life in a positive way.

06/07/23, 16:55 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, Anesu the only solution is to reach out to more and more kids.

In your essay, please explore the key aspects of their life, experiences, and actions that exemplify their consistent nature.

Before I could hear the word consistency and it's meaning from you I understood it in actions. There was a girl name Rudo Makumbe one I wouldn't feel ashamed to address as my role model because of what she has managed to achieve in her life and the path she took while chasing for the same. We all know that girls have a lot of responsibilities at home which includes the cooking, washing clothes, dishes etc and many girls take these as excuses for them not being able to do well in their studies however Rudo was different infact she would manage both the chores as well as the academics pretty much better than any other girl.
Despite all the work load she had at home she didn't make excuses infact she was always topper in her class , always got to the academia grounds early and most of the times she was always first to reach school. This attitude of hers shaped her present as well as the future that awaited her and that's how a consistent person really should be. She did not only impact her life but mine as well , knowing fully well that she had many responsibilities than I ever had but nonetheless she would do better than me in studies bruised my ego and pushed my focus a bit further and for that I really want to give lots of appreciations to her.

10/07/23, 15:50 - Jasmine Kaur: Thank you for sharing the inspiring story of Rudo Makumbe and how she embodies the essence of consistency. It is remarkable to hear about her dedication and achievements, despite the numerous responsibilities she had at home.

You mentioned that girls often face additional responsibilities at home, such as cooking, washing clothes, and other household chores. Many individuals use these responsibilities as excuses for not excelling in their studies. However, Rudo took a different approach. Instead of making excuses, she embraced her responsibilities and managed both her household chores and academics exceptionally well. This is amazing.
