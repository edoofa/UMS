Welcome to EWYL Line.
25/08/22, 23:35 - Eugenia EWYL21E0097: Yes Yes
26/08/22, 18:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian
I hope you are doing well!

The Class of 2022, as well as new graduate and professional students, have settled in but many are probably wondering what the next few years hold for them with Edoofa. One key element of Orientation is, as its name implies, getting students going in the right direction. Part of that is feeling welcomed and at home here on campus. Part is learning how to put your best foot forward, regardless of your background and previous experiences.

We are planning a pre-orientation session because the orientation program will now take place in the first few weeks of September. This session will be led by Ms. Davi, who will inform you of a few crucial details and have a wonderful surprise in store for every one of you.

The pre-orientation will take place through Google meet on Friday, 26th August, 6:30 PM IST 

Link:meet.google.com\/akg-jcxs-tbh

Kindly join 10 minutes in advance as the session will start exactly at 6:30 PM and students joining post 6:30 PM will not be allowed to join.
26/08/22, 18:18 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

What happened?
09/10/22, 15:47 - Unknown: Hello *My Proud Edoofian*!

Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. Those unfamiliar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.
Responses will be accepted on the *EWYL Line* only.
_Till then keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'_.

Happy learning and enjoy your weekend!

13/10/22, 00:43 - Unknown: We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real-life example. That is how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because in the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.
Responses will be submitted on the EWYL Line only.

18/10/22, 16:56 - Eugenia EWYL21E0097: According to the Wednesday wisdom lesson l learnt that asstudents, we are constantly learning and exposing\r
ourselves to situations that help us learn anything and\r
everything, but we must remember that each of us has\r
the same number of hours in a day. Hence it is very\r
important that we treat our Time as the currency of life.\r
Time Management is essentially Priority Managemen
There are certain things that are to be involved in a students time management strategies 
1) Setting a vision: Having a vision gives us a sense of\r
utilizing our time efficiently. Always spend time on things that move you\r
closer to your vision.\r
2) Create a Masterlist daily: A master list is a list of tasks\r
to be done on that particular day. It gives you a picture of\r
what your day is going to look like and helps you to\r
remember all that’s needed to be done. On this list, the\r
most important things go on top and then you keep moving\r
to less important ones.\r
3) Find your productive Cycle: This means finding the time\r
of the day when you have the maximum amount of focus\r
and energy.  \r
4) Leverage People: Leverage your network. Now, this is a\r
two-way street like every relationship- personal or\r
professional. You have to believe in others’ vision and\r
support them for them to reciprocate and help you.\r
Delegating your tasks, and utilizing resources available can\rhelp you increase your work efficiency
5) Select your Activities: This takes us back to our first\r
point. Any task that you do during the day has to be useful\r
and has to take you closer to your vision, If it’s not doing\r
that, always question yourself, your mentors, and the\r
people who support your vision and guide you to achieve\r
it. This will help you redirect your time and energy more\r
productively.\r
These steps help you be more productive\r
on a daily basis

19/10/22, 17:15 - Unknown: Along with this, I have come up with a brilliant opportunity for you Eugenia.
This is an amazing and exciting time for you to become the **face of the EDOOFA SCHOLARSHIP Program.**
So, Ms. Deepali, Head of Team EWYL, and I, your proud mentor, have prepared this opportunity to show the face of our dedicated students on Edoofa's social media platforms.

What all you have to do for this:
-you have to speak about SAFETY OF GIRLS
In the video, you have to speak about girl safety and security in the college.
Prefer shooting the video around the campus or nearby.

- The video has to be made professionally: wear a shirt, have a decent background, and have a stable camera.

- the video has to be about 60-90 seconds long.

- DEADLINE: THURSDAY (that is tomorrow), 12 PM
19/10/22, 21:47 - Unknown: Along with this Eugenia, can you please share your study in India video in the EWYL Group?
20/10/22, 20:11 - Unknown: Greetings Eugenia!
How are you?
20/10/22, 20:11 - Unknown: I am happy to tell you that this weekend we are having our great Indian festival, Deepawali and you know this festival holds a special place in the hearts of all Indian families. So yesterday, everyone in our office wore Ethnic dresses and celebrate Deepawali's party where we exchanged gifts and lit up the office with diyas and candles.
Due to this, there was a delay in sending you the Wednesday lesson for this week.
Please see to it and we will have a session tomorrow on the same because I want to give you time to ponder and work on it.
20/10/22, 20:11 - Unknown: In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.
