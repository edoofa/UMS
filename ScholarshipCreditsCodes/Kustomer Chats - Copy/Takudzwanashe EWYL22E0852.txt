To ignite our spirits for today's session, let's reflect on these powerful words by Maya Angelou: 'You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated.

07/12/23, 12:53 - Unknown: Good Morning Takudzwa
As we embark on today's session, let's kick-start our journey with a dose of inspiration from Jeff Bezos, the visionary founder of Amazon:
Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room

Now, what does this mean to you?

Imagine you're creating your personal brand every day. It's not just about how you see yourself; it's about the impression you leave on others. Whether you're in the classroom, chatting with friends, or pursuing your hobbies, you're shaping your brand—the way people perceive you.
So, let's dive into today's session with the mindset of crafting a brand that reflects your strengths, values, and aspirations. Together, we'll explore ways to amplify your unique qualities and set the stage for success, not just academically, but in every aspect of your lives.
Remember, each interaction, each achievement, contributes to your brand. Let's make it a story of growth, resilience, and positive impact!
07/12/23, 12:54 - Takudzwanashe EWYL22E0852: I am ready ma'am
