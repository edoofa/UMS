I hope that you are doing well

As August Intake is right at our doorsteps, So due to this many of our Edoofians will be arriving here in India to kick start their dream journey.?

I feel that it is my duty to make sure that the university has prepared well for their onboarding process.

This is why I would be visiting the universities Today in order to do a personal check up.
Since, This process would take up lots of time that is why we won't be able to connect Today.
However, I am sure that in my absence, You will make sure that you follow the below given things:

1. Make sure to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual at 9 AM Tomorrow.
2. Do submit the Wednesday Lesson before the deadline.
22/07/22, 19:45 - Quinton EWYL21E0182: Yes Sir

I hope that you are in good health and spirits ✨

In the past couple of days, You might have noticed that I was not very active on the EWYL DEDICATED LINE.

This was due to Arrival of 72 Edoofians who came this week.
I am very happy to inform you that all of them are settled and are busy with exploring the universities. ?

Today is the last day of their Admission Processes, So I would be visiting the universities to make sure everything goes well.

We will be starting our regular sessions with full flow from *Monday*.
Till then, I would like you to work on the *EWYL PROJECTS*.

Also, Make sure that you perform the *Proud Edoofian* Ritual on the *EWYL DEDICATED LINE* on Saturday and Sunday as well.
The chain should not break.

Have a blessed day ahead⭐

05/08/22, 00:07 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian,
Best wishes for the new day!
Team edoofa has arranged a webinar  for you all, 
The webinar would be taken by Ronard Kachage.
Designation  founder at Success Magazine.

Date  August 
Time  IST 

Takeaways from the webinar.
The topic will be along the lines of how Mr. Kachaje went on to pursue a career in real estate by having a degree in the same field and eventually figured out his calling which was building the media brand  Magazine. One of the many benefits of starting a business or pursuing your passions when one is a bit older is that they bring all of the experience and wisdom to the table. 
The journey of Mr. Kachaje is certainly inspiring, growth-oriented, and a wonderful example for the youth of today, not only in terms of being passionate about what you believe in but also having a consistent outlook towards learning on the way and figuring things out at the same time. 

Please fill the RSVP form  the RSVP Form: https:\/\/forms.gle\/NnZ5v4tj2tbkroKQ8
Link of the Webinar:   https:\/\/meet.google.com\/ofv-udzt-uai

My proud edoofian,

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
