- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter

16/03/23, 04:53 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian,
This week's Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the topic of \"Seeking Wealth, not Money or Status.\" This is an important lesson that will provide valuable insights into the pursuit of financial stability and success. During this lesson, we will explore the concept of wealth and its importance in building a sustainable financial future. We will discuss the difference between wealth, money, and status, and how each of these concepts plays a role in our lives.
I encourage you to read the lesson in detail and take notes to fully understand the material. It is important to engage with this topic and think critically about your own financial goals and aspirations.
By understanding the importance of seeking wealth over money or status, you can develop a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial success. I look forward to exploring this topic with you in more detail during our upcoming lesson.

Happy learning!","transform":"

18/03/23, 21:11 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings *my proud edoofian*!

Here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!
18/03/23, 21:11 - Aditi Kapoor: Please share your understanding of the lesson positively.

28/03/23, 21:32 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

As informed earlier, I was not available last week from Thursday to Friday and the organization was closed on Saturday and Sunday. So let's focus today's session solely on these three things:

1) Wednesday lesson + Weekend activity understanding
2) Whether you were able to complete last week's Projects targets?
3) What are the challenges you are facing in the projects?

Also, this week will be visiting our _Proud Indian Edoofians_ from Wednesday to Saturday. So, the sessions will not be held at that time. And I will be very happy to share the updates of our visit with you as the days go by?
28/03/23, 21:45 - Aditi Kapoor: The correct answer is A. Zambezi

Do you know? 

The Zambezi River is the fourth-longest river in Africa, the longest east-flowing river in Africa and the largest flowing into the Indian Ocean from Africa.","transform":"
28/03/23, 21:45 - Nkosilathi EWYL22E1252: Thank you
29/03/23, 00:54 - Aditi Kapoor: Please excuse me for the delayed response, I was occupied in an internal meeting with the team with was to be attended as a priority about our visit starting tomorrow till Saturday.
As informed, no sessions will be held during this time and we will begin afresh from next week onwards where I will be sharing some crazy and interesting insights with you.
But this will only be done, we you will NOT MISS these *THREE THINGS*:
1) Timely submission of the Wednesday lesson and weekend activity
2) Daily following the ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', the absence of which can lead to not sharing of weekly lessons and activities with you
3) and most importantly, *PROGRESS ON PROJECTS*

I will be tracking the progress on _Monday_.
I completely know that these two weeks, we might not have dedicated discussions on the projects. So in my absence, I want that you think in-depth about *the project you are doing, revising the targets for the same, and completing it*.
I would really be emotional and happy that in a few months, many of the new edoofians will be joining our Indian family here. And honestly, I will be happier that we start preparing now for the future because growth is not measured in one day. We need to work hard consistently and dedicatedly.

Like I always say ‘1 step daily means 1 step UP. 0 step daily means 1 step DOWN’.
I trust you, just believe in yourself.
