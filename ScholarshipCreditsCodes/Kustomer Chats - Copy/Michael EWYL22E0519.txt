17/12/22, 21:16 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, 
_I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?_

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!
18/12/22, 04:04 - Michael EWYL22E0519: Greetings.
I hope you are well.
I have come with an update on The African School Education Project.

I have been communicating with most of the schools and they are all giving me the same feedback that \"this can only be done when schools are open\".

Right now, here in Zambia, schools have closed, and schools only reopen in mid January.

I come today to ask if this project can resume once schools are open.
I decided to communicate because I did not want this to look like I'm failing the task at hand.

Your response will be highly appreciated.

28/12/22, 23:16 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
