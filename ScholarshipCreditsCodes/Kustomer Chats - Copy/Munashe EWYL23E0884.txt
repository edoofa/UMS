27/11/23, 17:03 - Munashe EWYL23E0884: Yes ma'am but l mistakenly did not take into consideration that it applies for weekend too , my bad
27/11/23, 17:10 - Aditi Kapoor: It's alright since it was done due to a communication gap.
I am sharing the Saturday Activity with you now, go through it and submit it by the end of the day.
27/11/23, 17:11 - Aditi Kapoor: As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals?

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.
27/11/23, 17:15 - Munashe EWYL23E0884: Thank you ma'am
27/11/23, 17:16 - Aditi Kapoor: So we are wrapping up today's session make sure you share the project updates and your Saturday Activity with me before the end of the day.
27/11/23, 17:17 - Munashe EWYL23E0884: Ok
27/11/23, 18:50 - Munashe EWYL23E0884: Spirit of competition is the willpower to win ,enjoyment to compete and recognition of the opponents efforts to succeed. 
The spirit of competition triggered something  in me that not to quit( never giving up). I remember well when l was at my ordinary level in athletic season , everyone was into athletes  and it was a stiff competition which grew stiffer day by day as selection proceeds to remain with only the best 100m sprint race.l made progress until  we were five (4 opponents) . I knew l had to man up and move an extra mile on my training. Surprisingly l was selected  and we were now only two , me and the other opponent -  he was known for setting records that no one could break .From this time l knew this was the of my season shining .Before we raced l even thought of forfeiting but l just did not believe that it was the end so l raced and surely l did not win as l had already doubted myself . Night  fell and l couldn't sleep thinkin  about what happened  that day . I told myself  l'm not a quitter    l have  to ask for another  race . Starting that night the athletes courts was my habitat day in and day out . Days drew closer for the final competition yet l had not improved on my time . I continued and to my surprise l improved . The big day arrived and l told myself it was going to be "then or never ." We got on track and l blasted  out the champion for the first time . Everyone was surprised.  I felt competition was some life teaching . I learnt that spirit of competition is worthy otherwise l wasn't going to be recognised as a champion too .
27/11/23, 18:55 - Munashe EWYL23E0884: The way to tackle challenges changed , this helped me to note that in every circumstance come up with a strategy and have the willpower to work it through .

As for the goals l realised that one can be his barrier to reach his maximum,so we have to be able to break those barriers
27/11/23, 18:58 - Munashe EWYL23E0884: For the projects ma'am lm reaching a dead end , lm trying to reach out to other principals but to no avail . And as for the community building  the colleagues are not decided yet for me to create the group and add them
27/11/23, 22:38 - Aditi Kapoor: Your journey in athletics, especially the 100m sprint race, is truly inspiring. It's remarkable how the spirit of competition became a catalyst for your determination and resilience. The realization that the spirit of competition encompasses the will to win, the enjoyment of the competition, and the recognition of opponents' efforts is profound. It's interesting how you mention that the spirit of competition taught you that it's "worthy," and your recognition as a champion was a direct result of embracing and thriving in that competitive environment. This underscores the transformative power of competition in shaping character and fostering personal growth.
27/11/23, 22:40 - Aditi Kapoor: Munashe, you shall create the group and then reach out to people. And it's okay you shall try reaching out to other schools.
28/11/23, 12:37 - Munashe EWYL23E0884: Greetings l am a proudly Edoofian
