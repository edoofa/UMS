20/07/22, 22:25 - Aditi Kapoor: Let me first help you understand what SWOT Analysis is.

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment.This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organisations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
20/07/22, 22:40 - Talent EWYL22E0263: Noted sir
21/07/22, 01:36 - Aditi Kapoor: As seen above, SWOT is an acronym of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. However, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym:

1 Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
2 Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
3 Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
4 Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by

They know their values, their skills and their abilities. They are also incredibly clear about their weaknesses. They don’t try to be amazing at everything and they don’t try to be someone they’re not.
I am going to make sure that I develop the same mindset  by  practicing the ritual of saying am a proud Edoofian message.  Successful people have a growth mindset and they’re happy to keep trying until they get what they want. They’re willing to try all kinds of strategies and techniques because they know they’ll eventually get them where they want to go. As a student I have to  to use other strategy with my project especially the school connecting projects and I should not give up.
Successful people are positive thinker that is they not you thier energy for negativity.I should try by all means to stay positive.
 Moreover,they also always finish what ever they would have started. I should try by all means do  my projects.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
