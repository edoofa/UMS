03/02/23, 18:18 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: I will do so.
08/02/23, 00:44 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr

08/02/23, 19:29 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings my proud edoofian,
I hope you are doing well!

Let us start our day with a quote: “Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.”

10/02/23, 19:27 - Jasmine Kaur: I am glad you feel that way. Thank you for sharing your absolutely amazing thought. I am glad you feel this way.
10/02/23, 19:29 - Jasmine Kaur: Choolwe, it will be really great if you can enlighten me about your current project updates.
10/02/23, 19:29 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: Sure thing!
10/02/23, 19:29 - Jasmine Kaur: I hope you are aware of all the projects.
10/02/23, 19:31 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: I am.
10/02/23, 19:33 - Jasmine Kaur: Good!
Have you started working on any project and what is the status?
10/02/23, 19:33 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: For the first project I was supposed to find companies that focus on fintech and use digital skills asi  well as focus on bettering young people such as myself. I did that and shared information about them with Me.Riva.
10/02/23, 19:35 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: The second project required me to share information about the Edoofa program with my friends. I managed to do that and got three people who were interested to fill out an application form and I shared them with Ms.Riva who shared them with the board.
10/02/23, 19:37 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: For my third project I was supposed to share information about the Edoofa program with schools in my country and connect them to it but I unfortunately haven't gotten any response from the schools I reached out to.
10/02/23, 19:40 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, since you have completed your assignment brilliantly and I will be constantly updating you about the scholarship credits as well.
10/02/23, 19:41 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: Alright I'll be looking forward to that
10/02/23, 19:42 - Jasmine Kaur: So Choolwe, Since you have started your regular curriculum now and after seeing your performance in the assignment. I am sure that you can achieve much more than this.
10/02/23, 19:44 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: I appreciate that thought Ms.
10/02/23, 19:47 - Jasmine Kaur: I want you to look for more companies and build your contacts and submit 5 more corporate alliance forms for the next week. 
This will help you to build contacts with people in the professional sector, you will learn a very important skill known as communication, and the best part you will be able to earn a lot more scholarship credits for you which will definitely make your journey easier.
10/02/23, 19:49 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: I'll will do my best to achieve that Ms.Jasmine.
10/02/23, 19:52 - Jasmine Kaur: I am sure dear that this small target will be a cakewalk for you. For next week focus on the Corporate Alliance project. 
For school connect, kindly tell me how are you approaching the schools?
10/02/23, 19:56 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: At first I was using my own strategy of first introducing myself then telling them briefly about the program and asking them whether they'd like to connect but Ms.Riva introduced me to a different approach.
10/02/23, 20:00 - Jasmine Kaur: Kindly enlighten me on what you understood from Ms. Riva's approach and how are you implementing it.
10/02/23, 20:05 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: I understood that I had to use a more formal way of communication while introducing myself, I also had to  ask them what time they'd be available for a discussion then at the suggested time I'd have to tell them all about the program in detail.
10/02/23, 20:08 - Jasmine Kaur: Exactly. Try working on this and let me know if you face any difficulty.

Let us end our Today’s session here.
I hope you have understood how you have to execute your projects.

11/02/23, 19:58 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

It's time for your Saturday Activity, This activity will allow you to reflect on your leadership abilities, share your experiences with your mentor, and receive feedback from them, which can help you grow as a leader.

1. You are required to think about a situation where you had to take the lead, such as organizing a school event, starting a new club, or resolving a conflict among friends.
2. Write a short reflection on the experience, focusing on the following points:
* What was the situation and what were the challenges you faced?
* How did you demonstrate the inner sense of captaincy in this situation?
* What were the results of your actions and how did you feel about your leadership?

You are required to share your responses by DATE over here at the EYWL Line.
12/02/23, 05:04 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: Good evening Ms.Jasmine, I apologize greatly for the delayed response. I was caught up with a few things today and I wasn't aware we had a session today.
12/02/23, 05:25 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: At my former school, I had a spot on the prefecture board and as a prefect it was my duty to insure things were going well outside the administration. 
There was a time when a misunderstanding occured between two eighth graders and one of them came to me and addressed the issue. She was crying because she was accused of saying something offensive to her intake mate which she herself had denied saying. Therefore, I went out of my way to help the two resolve this misunderstanding by making the two explain the situation from both their perspectives first then explaining to them that they should be careful of what they say out loud in future and that they should not rush into telling the situation to others before actually knowing what went on. They both understood that and apologized to one another. That made me feel like I can actually make a difference around the school by looking into such matters.

12/02/23, 16:35 - Jasmine Kaur: No problem Choolwe
12/02/23, 16:35 - Jasmine Kaur: You know you can actually make a difference. Leadership is about making a positive impact on the world around us, and I know that you have the drive and determination to do just that. Your passion for becoming successful and contributing to society is inspiring, and I believe that you could use that passion to make a difference in the lives of others.

I would like to encourage you to take on challenges and opportunities that will help you develop your leadership skills. This could be in the form of student government, leadership training programs, or mentorship opportunities. These experiences will not only help you grow as a leader but will also give you the chance to make a positive impact in your community.
12/02/23, 17:55 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: Thanks for that Ms.Jasmine, I will do as you have encouraged me to.
13/02/23, 06:35 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: I appreciate you sending the newsletter to me.
Am I supposed to give a response to those questions here or they are for me to reflect on on my own?
13/02/23, 18:09 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Morning dear Choolwe
You will get the opportunity to share your response in the upcoming session. 
Today I wanted to reach out to you regarding your upcoming class schedule. I have been planning something truly exciting and educational for us all to enjoy together. I have invested a lot of time and energy into creating a meaningful experience that will support your success and growth.
I believe that giving you a new schedule will allow us to have an even more productive and engaging class, and I am confident that you will appreciate the results of my efforts.

Are you ready? Let's hear it!
*Your batch is officially B 12 and our class timing will be from 12:00-1:00 pm on Tuesday and Friday. Apart from this, we will also be meeting on Wednesday and Saturday for Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday Activity.*

13/02/23, 23:30 - Jasmine Kaur: Go ahead dear.
13/02/23, 23:41 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: I went through my projects again and realized I was supposed to contact the companies but I only provided information about them without contacting them. I was therefore trying to correct that by contacting them today but some accounts can't be messaged unless I have a premium account.
13/02/23, 23:41 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: What should I do?
13/02/23, 23:53 - Jasmine Kaur: I will be sending you one screen recording. In that screen recording, you will see that first you have to click on the three dots beside Follow. 
Then some options will appear. On that, click on personalize invite and write a small invitation on why you want to connect to that person.
13/02/23, 23:54 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: Okay I'll wait.

13/02/23, 23:57 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: So for those that I managed to message, should I resend the message in that manner, or I leave it as it is?
14/02/23, 00:03 - Jasmine Kaur: How did you managed to message them?
14/02/23, 00:03 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: I went on the option that said \"message\" and sent them a message.
14/02/23, 00:09 - Jasmine Kaur: Let it be Choolwe, type the invitation, and once you are connected with them. 
Then only they will be able to see your messages.

14/02/23, 21:14 - Jasmine Kaur: \"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that count.\"  Churchill

This quote reminds us that success and failure are just temporary moments in our lives and what's most important is our ability to keep going, even when things get tough. So, have the courage to keep pursuing your dreams and never give up, no matter what obstacles come your way. Wishing you a great day ahead!

14/02/23, 21:41 - Jasmine Kaur: I am sure Choolwe,
14/02/23, 21:42 - Jasmine Kaur: So, What are your targets for this week Choolwe?
14/02/23, 21:44 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: This week I was thinking of trying to look at my second project which involves telling my friends about the Edoofa program. I did it previously but I was thinking maybe I can get more people
14/02/23, 21:45 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: Also, when are they people who applied previously likely to be give feedback?
14/02/23, 21:50 - Jasmine Kaur: For the Feedback, you can share the names of the students that you referred earlier. I will ask the team for the update and will let you know by tomorrow.
14/02/23, 21:50 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: Okay
14/02/23, 21:50 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: Chisala katele
14/02/23, 21:51 - Jasmine Kaur: I will suggest you to work on the Second and third projects simultaneously. 
One more I want to let you know is that don't stick to the limit. 
Try to achieve more every single week.
Use Whatsapp groups, and make student groups on Facebook. Try to get in touch with schools that are in a different district, or students who live in different districts. 
This will definitely speed up your progress.
14/02/23, 21:52 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: Kasonde Chisanga
14/02/23, 21:52 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: Kuluna Kamwandi
14/02/23, 21:53 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018: Okay I'll do as you have said.
14/02/23, 21:57 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes Choolwe, 
to
Don't stop here. It's just the beginning. Always remember your dream of pursuing higher education. Try to contribute as much as you can in the projects. Try to get in touch with as many students, schools, or companies as you can. 

By doing this, you are moving towards your dream and developing your own personality.
