21/07/22, 21:43 - Gamuchirai EWYL22E0185: I learnt that losers play the blame game but winners take responsibility of their mistakes.The story l read highlights that it is easy to blame people for our failures rather than taking responsibility , learning from the mistakes and finding solutions to the problem for the better benefit of the future.All we have to do is remain determined because our attitude towards situations plays a big role in our daily lives.Our attitude towards situations affects our perspective of things in life ,be it positively and negatively.l also learnt to ask further before giving a final judgement because if the sailer hadn't blamed the sea but breather asked first she wouldn't have been humiliated.Attituse either strengthens or destroys friendships or interaction with people
21/07/22, 21:54 - Aditi Kapoor: Good to read your response on this lesson Gamuchirai! I am glad that you were able to understand the crux of that which is that successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it.

Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

The way l speak should give positive feedback to my brain.lnstead of saying \" l'm no good at this\" ,l could say \" lm not great at this yet\".l should focus on rewarding actions and not traits.
