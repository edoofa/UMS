Happy new week my proud Edoofian! How are you doing today?

It was an interesting one and related to the EWYL projects and really fascinated me.

13/07/22, 03:04 - Unknown: Good to know that.

13/07/22, 18:04 - Unknown: Hello Denzel, my proud edoofian! How are you? Please send the proud edoofian message for the day.
13/07/22, 18:06 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofians hope you are doing well. \u2028\u2028You must have learned how critical it is to take advantage of every opportunity. In our Wednesday Wisdom this week, we discussed a profitable business- Skooqs. Do you know that Skooqs was developed in just five days!! Thanks to Oluwadamilola Soyombo's (Founder of Skooqs), diligence and use of the opportunity. The use of the opportunity at the right time with the right skills is currently creating a significant impact on the African entrepreneurial ecosystem.  And well some of you, because of your consistency, diligence, willingness to show up for your sessions, and performance in your weekly activities have gotten this opportunity to work on a project with Skooqs. 

You are probably aware of the possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. This week, I want you to think of a few skills or practices that a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits. 
Please list the skills that are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring in a lot of learning.

You are required to share your response in 150 to 200 words over the dedicated EWYL line TODAY.
13/07/22, 18:06 - Unknown: Also, I have an exciting video for you to go through, I sure was overwhelmed to see the love all of you shared. As I shared that the founders of the Edoofa program Mr. Angad and Mr. Avreen were traveling across Africa the whole of last month, I have some exciting highlights to share with you from the same. So, please watch the following video of the same and we will discuss it in our next session.

15/07/22, 17:47 - Unknown: good to know the video impacted you.
15/07/22, 17:47 - Unknown: Did you work on the wednesday wisdom task, I shared yesterday?
25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
