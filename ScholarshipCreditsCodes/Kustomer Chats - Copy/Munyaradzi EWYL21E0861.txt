16/05/23, 15:29 - Ananya: Greetings,

Are you ready for your session?
16/05/23, 15:31 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Good day. 
How are you?
Right now I'm at the hospital I'm getting my yellow fever vaccine.
I don't think I'll be able to participate.
16/05/23, 15:31 - Ananya: That is alright, I understand.
16/05/23, 15:32 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Okay thank you.
23/05/23, 15:42 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: I am a proud Edoofian

3.Mark Radebe

23/05/23, 15:42 - Ananya: How are you? Were you able to complete the activity shared with you earlier?
23/05/23, 15:43 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Unfortunately I was out of town.
I couldn't complete the task
23/05/23, 15:45 - Ananya: That is alright, I understand. You can submit it later in the evening.
23/05/23, 15:46 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Ok thank you
23/05/23, 15:48 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: 1
23/05/23, 15:52 - Ananya: Munyarazdi, I wanted to ask about your irregularity from the session, may I ask if you are facing any challenges?
23/05/23, 16:00 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: The truth is we received a list of steps that need to be completed before the end of the month from the Edoofa Admission team.
A lot of money has to be raised for the steps to be completed within the allocated time.
My parents are struggling a lot to raise the money.
I'm now working a part time job in order to help in raising the money. Sometimes I work late, sometimes extra hours so that I gain bonuses. It's the reason why I haven't been participating properly lately because I work every day except Sundays so I'll be trying to balance the time I'll be working and my sessions.
23/05/23, 16:07 - Ananya: I understand, Munyaradzi and I appreciate your efforts and dedication. It is good to be such a responsible child, I am proud of you!
23/05/23, 16:07 - Ananya: So, may I know about your available hours?
23/05/23, 16:12 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: I don't work on Sundays.
I'll be available from 1200 hours since I go to church in the morning.
23/05/23, 16:19 - Ananya: May I know if you can attend the session from 8:30 am to 10:30 am every Saturday?
23/05/23, 16:21 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Yes I can manage that.
23/05/23, 16:22 - Ananya: Alright, great! Le us connect on every saturday!
23/05/23, 16:23 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Okay.
Thank you so much for your understanding. I appreciate your efforts.
23/05/23, 17:15 - Ananya: Kindly Read our weekly newsletter and share your understanding before our next session.

17/06/23, 12:32 - Ananya: May I ask why are you late for your session?
17/06/23, 12:41 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Things are not quite right here at home.
My dad left so it's just now me, my mother and my two siblings.
I had a rough day yesterday and I overslept, please forgive me for being late.
17/06/23, 12:45 - Ananya: That is alright, if you don't mind may I ask what happened?
17/06/23, 12:46 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: He just left
17/06/23, 12:47 - Ananya: Where?
17/06/23, 12:51 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: He just left home on Wednesday morning and after he left he called my mother's sister and said that he has nothing to do with us anymore.
He didn't say anything to me or my mom.
17/06/23, 12:54 - Ananya: I'm really sorry to hear what happened. It seems like a tough and surprising situation. It can be painful when someone we care about chooses to move away from us without telling us why. We should remember that people make their own choices, and we might not always understand or agree with them.
17/06/23, 12:55 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Yes I understand ma'am
17/06/23, 12:56 - Ananya: How is your mother doing? Is she alright?
17/06/23, 12:57 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: She isn't.
She is just trying to be strong but....
We are all not fine
17/06/23, 13:00 - Ananya: I understand, Munyaradzi. Sometimes life presents challenges to test your strength and abilities. However, once you overcome those challenges, you become a stronger person. You will then have no fear and be capable of achieving anything on your own.
17/06/23, 13:02 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: True
And I promise you that nothing is going to stop me from chasing my dreams.
17/06/23, 13:05 - Ananya: I believe in you! It's important for you to take care of your mom too, as she needs her children with her. Remember to also prioritize your own health, Munyaradzi.
17/06/23, 13:09 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Thank you Ma'am
17/06/23, 13:11 - Ananya: Also, I want you to know that I'm always here to talk. If you ever feel upset about anything or find yourself in a difficult situation and need advice or simply want to share your feelings, you can reach out to me. I promise that talking to me will help you feel better.
17/06/23, 13:17 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: You're actually the first person I've shared this with
17/06/23, 13:30 - Ananya: I'm honored that you chose to share this with me. It takes courage to open up and confide in someone. I'm here to listen and support you in any way I can.
17/06/23, 13:31 - Ananya: I understand that you need some time for yourself, and your family needs your attention. Take care of yourself and your loved ones. We can reconnect later in the week.
17/06/23, 13:46 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Thank you for that ma'am
17/06/23, 13:47 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: That's okay
21/06/23, 20:07 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: I'm a proud Edoofian

01/07/23, 14:07 - Ananya: Now, let's talk about a challenge that is included in the above-mentioned Project Update! ‚úàÔ∏è
I have set a target for the coming week, which involves sharing:


*10 Community Building forms*
and
*2 School Connect forms*


To mark a session as completed, your active presence is required throughout our session time. If you encounter any network or mobile issues, I recommend addressing them beforehand so that we can make the most of our time together.

Remember, excuses won't be accepted because I believe in your determination.
01/07/23, 14:08 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Okay I understand
01/07/23, 14:09 - Ananya: Coming to the point that you might have also noticed and something that brings a flavor to this challenge is Extra Curricular activity


When it comes to overall assessment and evaluation, we believe it's not just about projects and lessons. It's about how passionate you are about yourself. Therefore, there is another aspect for evaluation, which is extracurricular activities.

In the next 21 days, It's your turn to show your amazing talent and be better than all the other students in this thrilling competition. Show everyone what you can do and make them amazed by your skills.

As your mentor, I want you to tell me about what else you are good at besides academics and share your idea of how you will showcase that talent to us.
01/07/23, 14:19 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Firstly I love music, I sing and I'm good at advertising, I also work in a music producing studio.
I'm not really quite sure how to showcase this
01/07/23, 14:20 - Ananya: That's amazing! So what are your plans? How do you plan to showcase your talent to us? Remember, you need to be creative in order to stand out among the other students. Additionally, we will be selecting a few of the best talents to showcase on our Edoofa page!
01/07/23, 14:20 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Acting as well
01/07/23, 14:23 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Since I'm good at acting and advertising, I could do one or two tasks that require these skills
01/07/23, 14:24 - Ananya: I think it would be better to sing a song!
01/07/23, 14:25 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Yes that would be great
01/07/23, 14:26 - Ananya: Well, I am quite excited to listen that!
01/07/23, 14:28 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Do I sing now or.....
01/07/23, 14:29 - Ananya: No dear, you have to submit it within the next 21 days!
01/07/23, 14:30 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Okay I understand
01/07/23, 14:35 - Ananya: I want to wish you the best of luck! Starting from Monday, your evaluation process will begin. Make sure you don't miss out on this incredible opportunity. These next 21 days might require some hard work, but I believe in you. I know you can put in the effort and make the most of this chance.
01/07/23, 14:36 - Munyaradzi EWYL21E0861: Okay thank you so much for your efforts.
I will do my best and give it my all.
01/07/23, 15:53 - Ananya: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self‚Äîthe person you aspire to be‚Äîand consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!
