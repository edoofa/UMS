26/06/23, 15:51 - Laura EWYL22E1275: Indeed it‚Äôs been a great start as I m just starting the Wednesday Wisdom.My sincere apologies for the late submission.In this Wednesday Wisdom based on Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,the first female president in Africa.Ellen was born on the 29th of October 1938. Like what is mentioned in the podcast she‚Äôs really a great aspiration towards us as female Edoofians and a charismatic,fearless and victorious image for the females to step up into the political world which was only considered to be a patriarchal society. The life lessons that can inspire and guide us all in the Wednesday wisdom include:  A foundation of Tenacity,Leadership in Challenging times,A commitment to integrity,Breaking gender barriers,Empowering youth and education , Collaboration and diplomacy,Environmental stewardship and Legacy of inspiration. I am just going to indicate a few that I found way more aspiring.To start with,leadership in challenging times. Sirleaf became a beacon of hope during Liberia‚Äôs tumultuous time of political instability and civil war. Leaders are tested in critical times like that. Henceforth, a Edoofians can learn that true leadership requires the courage to make difficult decisions and the compassion to uplift others.Secondly,empowering youth and education.Edoofians are inspired to value education,seize opportunities for growth and work towards empowering themselves and their communities as Ellen emphasized the importance of investing in education and empowering the youth to drive positive change.Subsequently,legacy of inspiration.Edoofians should embrace their ability to effect change no matter age or background and aspire to leave a positive and lasting legacy in their communities

26/06/23, 16:08 - Laura EWYL22E1275: Yeah I saw you
26/06/23, 16:09 - Unknown: Laura, today when I was on my way to the organization, I came across a motivational story on my phone and I learned a lot from it. I wish to share it with you so that you can read and learn something from the moral of the story. Would you like to know?
26/06/23, 16:13 - Laura EWYL22E1275: Yes
26/06/23, 16:14 - Unknown: One morning, an elderly man was walking along the beach when he noticed a young boy picking something off the sand and throwing it into the sea.
As he got closer, the man realized the child was throwing stranded starfishes that had washed up on the shore back into the breaking waves.
Approaching the boy, the man asked what he was doing.
‚ÄúThe starfish will die if they‚Äôre still on the shore when the sun rises,‚Äù he replied.
Perplexed, the old man said, ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs pointless! There are countless miles of beach and thousands of starfish. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many you return to the water, you can‚Äôt make a difference.‚Äù
Unfazed, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish, and tossed it into the sea.
‚ÄúIt matters to this one,‚Äù he said.
26/06/23, 16:24 - Laura EWYL22E1275: Quite interesting
26/06/23, 16:24 - Laura EWYL22E1275: But I didn‚Äôt get it though
26/06/23, 16:25 - Unknown: Let me share the moral so that you understand.
26/06/23, 16:25 - Unknown: Moral of the story:

No matter the odds of success or the scale of the challenge, your actions can make a difference. It‚Äôs better to light a candle than curse the dark.

Every little counts. Doing something to make a positive change is always better than nothing!
26/06/23, 16:27 - Laura EWYL22E1275: Ooh now I get it
26/06/23, 16:30 - Unknown: We are now gonna set targets for our projects, I do not want us to lag behind other students, There are students who have already earned more than 1200$ And I wish us to earn more than them.
26/06/23, 16:30 - Unknown: I would like you to send me 2 student Forms every day. And if you fail to bring me 1 form on one day then the next day you will have to bring 3 forms so that we don't miss our targets. How does that sound? so now every week we will have 14 forms okay?
And next week we will work on schools.
26/06/23, 16:48 - Laura EWYL22E1275: Sure thing
28/06/23, 17:08 - Laura EWYL22E1275: I‚Äôm a proud Edoofian

28/06/23, 19:04 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

01/07/23, 15:36 - Unknown: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self‚Äîthe person you aspire to be‚Äîand consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!
