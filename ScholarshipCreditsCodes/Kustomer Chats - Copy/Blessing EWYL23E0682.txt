01/12/23, 15:45 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
01/12/23, 15:46 - Blessing EWYL23E0682: Noted
01/12/23, 15:50 - Ananya: Now, I believe that we should start with something that aligns with your interests. So, would you like to tell me which one is your favorite project: the community building or the schools connect?
01/12/23, 15:51 - Blessing EWYL23E0682: Community building
01/12/23, 15:53 - Ananya: Well, that's great! May I ask about your progress in that project so far?
01/12/23, 15:54 - Blessing EWYL23E0682: Well i have issued the application form to friends and they are yet to fill and submit once they are done i will inform you.
01/12/23, 15:55 - Blessing EWYL23E0682: Also i did talk to the principal from my school and i told him briefly about EDOOFA so once he is done i will let you know so that you guys will arrange for a meeting
01/12/23, 15:55 - Ananya: Well, have you asked your school head to fill out the form?
01/12/23, 15:56 - Blessing EWYL23E0682: Yes
01/12/23, 15:58 - Ananya: Have you shared it with me?
01/12/23, 15:59 - Blessing EWYL23E0682: He hasn't sent back the form yet
01/12/23, 16:00 - Ananya: Well, why don't you drop a follow-up message to him?
01/12/23, 16:00 - Blessing EWYL23E0682: I did so..but no responses yet
01/12/23, 16:00 - Blessing EWYL23E0682: This maybe due to Network
01/12/23, 16:08 - Ananya: Alright, don't worry! Let us wait for his response, otherwise, you can call him once.
01/12/23, 16:09 - Blessing EWYL23E0682: Okay
01/12/23, 16:14 - Ananya: So do you have a group for your community  building project?

01/12/23, 16:18 - Blessing EWYL23E0682: Yes, please!
01/12/23, 16:18 - Ananya: You know, one of my students' friends is studying in a different school. She has actually joined their WhatsApp class groups and is now communicating with them. Not only that, since she is connected with students from various schools, she is also obtaining the contact information of school administrators. This way, she is working on two separate projects simultaneously.
Don't you think it is an amazing idea?
01/12/23, 16:20 - Blessing EWYL23E0682: Yes
01/12/23, 16:23 - Ananya: Alright, in addition to the resources we already have in our EWYL group, I was thinking of sharing a few more with you. This way, you can then pass them along to your students and school heads.
01/12/23, 16:23 - Blessing EWYL23E0682: Okay
01/12/23, 16:25 - Ananya: Do you think you require these resources, Blessing?
01/12/23, 16:25 - Blessing EWYL23E0682: Yes
01/12/23, 16:25 - Ananya: You can also share our Edoofa Instagram page.
Additionally, did you know that the First Lady of Zimbabwe took time during her visit to India to meet the CEO of Edoofa? How can this be a fraud?

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

Best Regards
TEAM EWYL!

Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!

Hope you are doing well.

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

05/12/23, 16:36 - Ananya: Let me help you with how can you connect with the students!
05/12/23, 16:36 - Blessing EWYL23E0682: Okay
05/12/23, 16:37 - Ananya: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
05/12/23, 16:37 - Ananya: *Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
