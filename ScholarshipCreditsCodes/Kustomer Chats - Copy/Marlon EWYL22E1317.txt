How are you?

I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
15/03/23, 22:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
15/03/23, 22:16 - Marlon EWYL22E1317: Greetings to you too

16/03/23, 04:54 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian,
This week's Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the topic of \"Seeking Wealth, not Money or Status.\" This is an important lesson that will provide valuable insights into the pursuit of financial stability and success. During this lesson, we will explore the concept of wealth and its importance in building a sustainable financial future. We will discuss the difference between wealth, money, and status, and how each of these concepts plays a role in our lives.
I encourage you to read the lesson in detail and take notes to fully understand the material. It is important to engage with this topic and think critically about your own financial goals and aspirations.
By understanding the importance of seeking wealth over money or status, you can develop a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial success. I look forward to exploring this topic with you in more detail during our upcoming lesson.

Happy learning!","transform":"

18/03/23, 20:37 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings *my proud edoofian*!

Here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!

20/03/23, 17:58 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

21/03/23, 21:01 - Marlon EWYL22E1317: Oww thank you for the correction
21/03/23, 21:28 - Saloni Rastogi: You know I am deeply inspired by the missions that you have shared with me.
I was stuck at the point where you mentioned that you want to improve lives, I am sure that with your pure heart, you can do that.
Along with this, in every response, I like to enlighten my students on how I feel about the lesson\/activity and how smoothly it connects with them.
For this one also, I would firstly say that my biggest mission is to provide a happy life for my mother who has done so much for me in the past so many years.
And the second goal, that I believe is driving me every day to work hard is the curiosity to meet my students at the airport and see them earning at least $100 of scholarship credits every month so that they become so independent that can pay their own fees.
21/03/23, 21:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Moving towards your projects.
 Proud Edoofian, TODAY, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
21/03/23, 21:29 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead tomorrow.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him\/her for your School Head’s Contact.
21/03/23, 21:31 - Marlon EWYL22E1317: I got this number from a teacher at elephant high school from a teacher who used to help me with my studies for A level

21/03/23, 23:07 - Saloni Rastogi: This is now amazing!
21/03/23, 23:08 - Saloni Rastogi: It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
21/03/23, 23:08 - Saloni Rastogi: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
21/03/23, 23:08 - Saloni Rastogi: So, This is what the First message should look like:

I am pleased to observe that a majority of you comprehended well, the message  that was conveyed in this week's Wednesday wisdom. It brought me great joy to go through student’s perspectives on wealth creation and the mindset essential for embarking on this path.

I have a special Saturday assignment for you. The objective of this assignment is to help you understand the steps you can take to prepare yourself for wealth creation. The assignment will encourage you to identify their goals, develop a financial plan, and cultivate the mindset and habits needed to achieve financial success.

Here are some instructions to make it easy for you to work on this assignment:
1. Goal Setting: The first step towards wealth creation is to set clear and achievable goals. In this section, write down your short-term and long-term financial goals. Explain how each goal will contribute to your overall financial success.
2. Financial Planning: A financial plan is a roadmap that outlines how you will achieve your financial goals. In this section, develop a comprehensive financial plan that includes strategies for budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management. Identify the resources you will need to achieve your financial plan and explain how you will access them.
3. Mindset and Habits: Wealth creation is not just about having a financial plan; it is also about cultivating the mindset and habits that will help you achieve your goals. In this section, identify the mindset and habits that are necessary for financial success. Explain how you will cultivate these qualities in yourself and develop strategies to overcome any obstacles that may arise.
4. Conclusion: In this section, summarize your findings and discuss the importance of preparing yourself for wealth creation. Reflect on what you have learned throughout the assignment and discuss how you will apply these principles in your own life.

27/03/23, 21:45 - Saloni Rastogi: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!
