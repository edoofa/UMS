26/12/23, 03:19 - Tanatswa EWYL23E0560: Christmas is a holiday that binds distant family members. Christmas day is a day when Jesus was born hence the celebration by fellow Christian communities. It has become a day where all look forward to in anticipation of receiving and giving. The kind act of giving during Christmas spreads love throughout the nation strengthening it's togetherness. 

In my family, we highly consider Christmas to be a family event. Thus every Christmas we gather as a family talking about nothing and everything. Another symbol that marks Christmas for my family is the special diet we make every 25th of December. My mother always makes extra-ordinary dishes that make the taste buds desire more.

At times we visit recreational centres near us for exposure and joy. For example, Lion and Cheetah Park, Snake world as well as  Lake Chivero.

29/12/23, 16:24 - Tanatswa EWYL23E0560: I learnt that i should establish goals that build positive relationships with the people around me. I also learnt to think outside the box and to view setbacks and learn and emerge stronger.
29/12/23, 16:30 - Ananya: Great, Tanatswa! Now,  the weekend is arriving, and after this weekend, we will be landing in a completely new year, which is going to be special as you step into a new journey of your life. I want you to begin this journey with some productivity. Therefore, I am giving you a small target for the weekend. Connect with at least 4 students and submit their application forms with me.
Since you are working on your own credits, could you work on this diligently? Remember, your hard work now is something that will help you in your future endeavors! This is me speaking from experience!
29/12/23, 16:34 - Tanatswa EWYL23E0560: Yes ma'am. I shall try my best in submitting the 4 application forms ma'am
29/12/23, 16:38 - Ananya: I hope you remember that the two goals of the EWYL program are to earn credits and learn skills. To ensure that you are both learning and earning, I am setting small targets regularly. However, now I want to emphasize that together we focus on learning daily skills and strengthening our minds to be employability-ready. What do you think?
29/12/23, 16:52 - Tanatswa EWYL23E0560: It is a good idea
29/12/23, 16:53 - Ananya: Great! you know as we approach the new year, I want you to focus on two big goals: earning credits and learning skills.

Promise me you'll work hard so we can make your dreams a reality.
29/12/23, 16:57 - Tanatswa EWYL23E0560: I promise to work hard ma'am as this is a crucial time for me
29/12/23, 16:58 - Ananya: Alright, during the weekend, I will work on a plan so that we can manage both of our goals. We will begin with LinkedIn first. So, get ready because this year, we are going to work hard and focus on our bright future right from the beginning.
29/12/23, 16:59 - Tanatswa EWYL23E0560: Yes ma'am
29/12/23, 17:03 - Ananya: Now as I am concluding our session I want to share something with you, as your mentor, I am invested in ensuring your success and growth. In light of this, I've decided to implement a change in our process. Moving forward you have to submit your lesson response before the beginning of our session. Only then will I move ahead with the session and mark your attendance. If you want, you can submit your response immediately after receiving the activity or lesson.
