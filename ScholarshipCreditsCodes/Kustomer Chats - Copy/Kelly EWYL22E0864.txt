25/01/23, 18:43 - Kelly EWYL22E0864: Greetings, Mr. Maurice, I am Kelly and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is EWYL22E0864
25/01/23, 18:48 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello Kelly, Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Line. Here we practice a 'mantra' where you should always start and end the day by saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' to boost your energy!
25/01/23, 18:49 - Kelly EWYL22E0864: Alright that’s amazing
25/01/23, 18:49 - Kelly EWYL22E0864: I am a proud Edoofian
25/01/23, 18:50 - Aditi Kapoor: So let us start with the Projects we have discussed before. Can you recall what are those 3 projects as discussed before?
25/01/23, 18:51 - Aditi Kapoor: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
25/01/23, 18:54 - Kelly EWYL22E0864: We discussed about the cooperate  appliance project, community building and African schools education reform mission
25/01/23, 18:54 - Kelly EWYL22E0864: Alright sir
Noted
25/01/23, 18:55 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes! Now As discussed before, In Today’s session, We will be discussing *How we can improve our performance on the African School Education Reform Mission Project*.

Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located?
25/01/23, 19:01 - Kelly EWYL22E0864: 1. My school is Girls High School Harare. It is not connected with Edoofa
2. Greetings to you Sir\/ Madam
My name is Kelly Chibweza and I belong to a group of enthusiastic students called Edoofa. It is a very good program that offers scholarships to international students. The main aim for the program is to provide affordable and accessible education which results in an employable student. I got the scholarship there as well and I would like to share with you a bit of information about this amazing program.
3. Harare province
25/01/23, 19:13 - Aditi Kapoor: Proud Edoofian, This week, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
25/01/23, 19:13 - Aditi Kapoor: May I know if you have Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead tomorrow.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him\/her for your School Head’s Contact.
25/01/23, 19:15 - Kelly EWYL22E0864: Alright sir 
I will definitely look for the contact today
25/01/23, 19:26 - Aditi Kapoor: Now, Once you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering professional communication, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
25/01/23, 19:27 - Aditi Kapoor: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
25/01/23, 19:28 - Kelly EWYL22E0864: Alright I’ve understood
25/01/23, 19:29 - Kelly EWYL22E0864: Alright sir
25/01/23, 19:31 - Aditi Kapoor: So, This is what the First message should look like:
25/01/23, 19:31 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Mr.\/Mrs *School Head Name*

I am *Your Name* and I am a student of _School Name_ school.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result\/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
25/01/23, 19:32 - Kelly EWYL22E0864: Alright sir

01/02/23, 19:40 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

Happy Learning!

Ready??                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

The inner sense of captaincy is a vital component of leadership that gives individuals the confidence and determination to make a positive impact. It involves having a deep understanding of oneself, embracing weaknesses, and having a positive growth-oriented mindset. Developing an inner sense of captaincy can help individuals navigate challenges, inspire and motivate others, and tap into their full potential as leaders. In today’s Wednesday wisdom, we will explore the importance of this aspect of leadership.
