14/07/22, 00:09 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, because Ms.Davi has been constantly asking me about your attendance.
14/07/22, 00:09 - Aditi Kapoor: So that we are on the same page can you please tell the 2 days of your batch sessions and the time slot as well?

14/07/22, 00:15 - Aditi Kapoor: Now, on these 2 days I will text you on your *EWYL group* before your session so that you can get a reminder.
14/07/22, 00:31 - Arthur Dota: noted.
14/07/22, 00:31 - Arthur Dota: sorry for the late submission, prior to the reason I earlier on highlighted.

According to a trusted source of data, west African entrepreneurs have raised an approximate 4.2 billion USD since 2019. This in turn amounted to 41% of all funding produced in Africa at that time. Nigeria raised about 45% of these funds. This is being linked to Africa because there's also a very inspiring story about Oluwadamilola Soyombo, the core founder of skooqs. After she graduated in 2018, after also studying computer science, she wasn't completely sure about what she wanted to pursue. After being an ambitious member in the technology industry, she managed to get her mind on these huge idea of creating a  program that would help less fortunate kids in funding their educational costs and learning. Skooqs has then been working with Edoofa, with the same aim of improving education to African kids who're zealous and hardworking. From this ispiring masterpiece of a story, I've managed to learn that in this morden world that we're living in, both men and women are just as capable to improve the world around us, I've also learned that in order to succeed at something in life one must be persistent and endure a lot of circumstances to obtain what it is they want.
14/07/22, 00:33 - Arthur Dota: I have a question please.
14/07/22, 00:38 - Aditi Kapoor: Go ahead.
14/07/22, 00:39 - Aditi Kapoor: Arthur, deadlines are everything in EWYL.
Ms.Davi will not accept it now.
14/07/22, 00:47 - Arthur Dota: in the next assignments, could I please answer back using voice notes or you only expect readable text.
14/07/22, 16:38 - Arthur Dota: I'm a proud Edoofian.

15/07/22, 19:31 - Aditi Kapoor: Arthur before moving further, I would want to know the reason of not responding to my text.
15/07/22, 22:27 - Arthur Dota: you do realize I'm still in full time schooling right? that means if we do not have sessions the very chances of me holding my cellphone at school are extremely on the low side, considering that I'll be busy with other things.
15/07/22, 22:49 - Arthur Dota: I think it's better if I give you my timetable: 
From 7.30am to 12.30pm I'm either doing Pure Mathematics or Physics.
12.30pm to 1.00pm I have my lunch.
1.00pm to 2.00pm I'm doing Statistics.
2.00pm to 5.00pm I'm doing Chemistry.
5.00pm to 6.00pm I'm preparing for evening study. 
6.00pm to 9.00pm I'm in evening study.

So as of previously, I have been trying to slot our sessions between 12 and 1 since I'll be having lunch I won't be entirely busy to not text back.

16/07/22, 18:16 - Aditi Kapoor: Goodmorning Arthur ,
I understand what you are saying.

You are in full time schooling and you have a very tight schedule.
But, each one of us manages our day in a way and time management is the key motive of that.

I would not want to disturb you, I understand you need to give time to your studies.
I respect that as well.

But at the same time it is very important to realize the importance of someone else's time as well.
This the pure key to sucess.
16/07/22, 18:19 - Aditi Kapoor: Also, I am here for you.
You can take out 15 minutes slot during your lunch and send me *I am a proud edoofian*  here on the EWYL line.
I will notify you if there is anything important and rest of the time during the day you can devote to your studies.

Please keep in mind that along with what is there in the books , it is essential to learn various practical and communication skills as well.
16/07/22, 19:02 - Arthur Dota: thanks for understanding ma'am.
16/07/22, 21:00 - Aditi Kapoor: So now are we on the same page about this?

18/07/22, 18:00 - Aditi Kapoor: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
Let us start our day with this beautiful quote  got to get up every morning with determination if you’re going to go to bed with satisfaction.” – George Lorimer
18/07/22, 18:15 - Arthur Dota: \"Got to get up every morning with determination if you're going to go to bed with satisfaction\".
18/07/22, 21:22 - Aditi Kapoor: Arthur, we have your session tomorrow
18/07/22, 21:23 - Aditi Kapoor: You missed your Saturday task because of our ongoing discussion so here it is, please read it,complete it and submit it!
*Let me know if you have any doubts!*

Saturday Activity .

Its that time of the week, when you are required to wear your thinking caps and get your tools ready to research and learn! From our Wednesday Wisdom, we learnt how Patrice Motsepe, became successful by making the best of the opportunity very few could see, the strong potential in the mining industry. As part of your Saturday Activity you are required to share a detailed submission on the fast growing industry\/sector\/business in your country. Don’t forget to add a SWOT analysis and the predictions on the future performance of the same.

Word limit- 250-500 word Use of the internet is allowed but do not copy the entire submission from the internet. You have to write it in your own words.
Deadline given is :   *Tomorrow 12 PM*
18/07/22, 21:23 - Aditi Kapoor: You can submit it tomorrow in your session, do take out 15 minutes to complete this.
18/07/22, 22:12 - Arthur Dota: okay ma'am.
18/07/22, 22:12 - Arthur Dota: okay ma'am.
18/07/22, 22:30 - Arthur Dota: The fast growing business here in Zimbabwe is Web Development and Hosting.
The future is no doubt digital and definitely online. Even businesses rooted in the old way like real estate agents are now employing video call technology to show houses to potential clients. Closer to home the ZSE has created an online platform for fund managers and institutional investors to trade in shares bypassing brokers. All this should be a sign that more and more businesses will need to be online. Web Development and Hosting play an integral part in this so businesses in these areas offering the right services are set for growth. Also, prior to the COVID 19 pandemic, many if not all of the businesses have opted for a more online and digital way of handling businesses, in attempts to strictly adhere to the Virus' regulations and the new normal. Physical interactions have been greatly minimized, this has opened way for a more digital approach of handling business negotiations and meetings. This has resulted in many new job opportunities, and is indeed the fastest growing industry in Zimbabwe as for now.

21/07/22, 21:53 - Arthur Dota: sure ma'am let us do that
21/07/22, 22:09 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay so please share your learnings from the same?
21/07/22, 22:25 - Arthur Dota: From the Wednesday wisdom, I managed to pick up a good lesson and it will help me through changing the way I handled situations.
In order to archive something in this life one must be ready to accept the fact that along the way they are going to encounter numerous challenges but that shouldn't make them lose focus in any way. Many times when we fail at something, the first thing we try to do is to look for someone to blame, like the sailor did, but on reality, it is essential that we understand that failure isn't always because of the next person. Sometimes we fail entirely because of ourselves and ourselves only. Even if it is justifiable to blame the next person, we should not blame people for our own shortcomings but instead we should work on a way to outmaneuver challenges and come back stronger than before.
21/07/22, 22:33 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, I am glad you were able to grasp so many things at such a young age
