12/09/23, 12:31 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0936: "Psalms 23 You going to make it trust me," I quote one of my favourite bible verses. This will not make my problems disappear but rather it makes me resilient and see the past in a different way, makes me want to learn and develop more different skills that are going to stop me from falling apart. 
Mr Angad Singh gave a quote that says, "Hard work is the chisel that sculpts your dreams into reality, and motivation
is the fuel that keeps the fire of progress burning bright."
As I was going throught the quote, I broke it into parts, I made topics out of a single quote.
i)HARD WORK IS THE CHISEL THAT..... 
   One thing people don't understand in life is If you want to be a better person or a role model, you have to face your problems. Stand your ground against you difficulties, figure out what needs to be done, make a plan for your solution and finally take action in it. It may be painful or it might take time to recover from a major setback, traumatic event or loss but for you to recover know that your situation needs you to work on it and you'll improve. 

ii) SCULPTS YOUR DREAM INTO REALITY... 
I usually like to quote bible verses and it says on Romans 8:18 the pain you've been feeling can't compare to the joy that is coming. As a person, you can't change the past but you can always look towards the future and make it better but this is done through hardwork accepting and even anticipating change makes it easier to adapt and view new challenges with less anxiety. I love the quote that says never regret a day in your life. Good days give you happiness and bad days give you experience. Now you'll have to consider skills and strategies that helped you go through your difficulties.

iii)AND MOTIVATION IS THE FUEL... 
Building strong, positive relationships with loved ones and friends can provide you with needed support, guidance and acceptance in good and bad times. Establish other important connections by volunteering or joining a faith or spiritual community or even a club. These people will always help you push harder in everything you do. They will never let you give up.

iv)THAT KEEPS THE FIRE OF PROGRESS BURNING BRIGHT.
Becoming more resilient takes time and practice. Basically in resilience you have to adapt to difficult situations. You have to know that you going to be angry, you going to be in grief, in pain but you have to keep the fire burning. Sometimes it isn't about putting up with something difficult, being stoic or figuring it out on your own. In fact, being able to reach out to others for support is a key part of being resilient.
12/09/23, 12:31 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0936: The first was to seek support. I still remember one of the key terms we talked about with the Edoofa counselors was team work or family spirit. You can never underestimate the power of family spirit. Communication is one of the best ways one can maintain a healthy status and with the help of others, it is easier to manage time responsibly.
One has to set some realistic goals. As for me,a proud Edoofa, I'm glad I have a mentor. When it comes to things like setting your goals, sometimes you need to seek guidance and second opinions. Mentors will always be there to help you out break down the goals into manageable steps or smaller tasks.
Learn from setbacks. Never regret a day in your life. Good days give you happiness and bad days give you experience. Bad experiences are there to make you learn and know how to tackle in times of bad situations.
Develop resilience. Never give up and you'll notice sweeter things in your way. No matter the situations, aim to focus on your goal and make it cone true .
Focus on solutions. Whenever you face a challenge, take time to contemplate and find a better solution to overcome it.

Comment below to share what inspires you about their journey!
14/09/23, 12:43 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0936: The first exam tip u can get from me is never give up because lot is going to be on your way and never stop praying. Have faith in what you are doing. Another thing is never hesitate to try something because the result will tell you if you was wrong or right. Another things is plan a study schedule that covers all topics and if it js hard for you break them into smaller chunks that will make it easier for you to understand. It is also important to take some breaks and refreshments when studying because the mind needs to rest after doing something. Prioritise the most important topics and take them seriously so that they don't cost you in exams. Study groups have also proven to be helpful as you can gather new things that you didn't grasp in your previous work.
14/09/23, 13:07 - Unknown: Good Morning.

18/09/23, 16:55 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0936: Personally if I've always had a question that is always ringing in my mind of how to answer , "where do u see yourself in the next five years." And sometimes it's not that simple to answer. As for me honestly, I don't know where I'll be, but what I have certain goals and ambitions that I feel like I have to fulfill in my life. People see it as an easy question , but when it comes right into your face maybe in a job interview or something, it might cost you . So I think, the only question I might have is how to answer that question
18/09/23, 23:55 - Unknown: Good Evening Tadiwanashe
I hope you are doing well

It indeed is a great question that you asked. And I am impressed with your understanding already.
18/09/23, 23:58 - Unknown: This question is designed to assess your long-term career goals and your ability to plan for the future. Interviewers want to know if your aspirations align with the job and if you're a committed, forward-thinking person.
19/09/23, 00:00 - Unknown: How to Answer:

1. Be Realistic: Ensure your response is grounded in reality. While ambition is commendable, make sure your goals are achievable within a five-year timeframe.

2. Relevance: Tailor your answer to the position and company. Show that you've researched the role and understand how it fits into your career path.

3. Show Growth: Express a desire for professional growth and development. Mention how you plan to enhance your skills and take on more responsibilities.

4. Highlight Alignment: Emphasize how your goals align with the company's mission and objectives. This shows that you're committed to contributing to the organization's success.
19/09/23, 01:06 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0936: This is definitely the answer I've been seeking for months now .... thank you so much for the support .... words can't every express how grateful I am, and good night
19/09/23, 12:35 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0936: I ama a proud EDOOFIAN

19/09/23, 13:46 - Unknown: Now, let's shift attention to the three projects we've been discussing, particularly the

Community Building and African School Reforms initiatives.
19/09/23, 13:46 - Unknown: Could you provide an  update on the Community Building project? What progress have you made?
19/09/23, 13:51 - Unknown: How many community-building forms have you successfully completed, and what is the typical number of students you have engaged with on average?
19/09/23, 13:54 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0936: The number is kind of embarrassing, I only 4 friends to help me pass the message
19/09/23, 13:54 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0936: But the 4 are willing to join though
19/09/23, 14:03 - Unknown: This is good thing to start with Tadiwanashe.

19/09/23, 14:11 - Unknown: After reading your response I can understand that you need to have an organized plan.  Before you start doing your project, it's a good idea to be a little organized.

19/09/23, 14:12 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0936: I think so far so good, maybe from the project that i have to talk to the headmaster that's the one I'm working on ... I was going through the previous sessions so that I don't make mistakes
19/09/23, 14:13 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0936: My plan was to talk to some students and convince them to talk to their friends about this opportunity and then I'll create a group that I'd talk to everyone about the üö∏
19/09/23, 14:14 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0936: Sorry I meant about the scholarship
19/09/23, 14:15 - Unknown: Yes, Tadiwanashe. 
Now that the planning part is done, I want you focus completely on the execution.
19/09/23, 14:15 - Unknown: Now, turning our attention to the African School Reforms project. Could you share your insights on the current state of this project?
19/09/23, 14:15 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0936: Sure thing ma'am
19/09/23, 14:17 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0936: On this part, I only managed to get the contact details of my former school deputy headmaster and I was planning on talking to him either today or tomorrow
19/09/23, 14:19 - Unknown: Okay. Kindly share the updates on this in our next session.
19/09/23, 14:20 - Unknown: What milestones have you reached, and do you foresee any potential difficulties that might affect your  progress?
