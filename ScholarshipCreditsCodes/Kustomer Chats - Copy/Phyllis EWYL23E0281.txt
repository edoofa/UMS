I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into ‚Äì the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work ‚Äì a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.üåü

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.ü§ù

18/12/23, 12:53 - Phyllis EWYL23E0281: I am a prudly Edofian
18/12/23, 15:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Good afternoon Phyllis,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
18/12/23, 15:43 - Phyllis EWYL23E0281: Yeah sure we can do that
18/12/23, 15:43 - Phyllis EWYL23E0281: I hope I found Yu well
18/12/23, 15:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Phyllis, I would like to correct you in the way you follow the daily ritual. It is not 'I am a prudly Edofian', it is 'I am a proud edoofian'.
18/12/23, 15:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, I am doing well, thank you!
18/12/23, 15:47 - Phyllis EWYL23E0281: Noted
18/12/23, 15:47 - Phyllis EWYL23E0281: Cool
18/12/23, 15:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, you have not received the Saturday activity since on 16th, you have not followed the daily ritual. May I know the challenges?
18/12/23, 15:47 - Phyllis EWYL23E0281: I had data issues mam
18/12/23, 15:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Phyllis, I am sure you must be facing network issues but let me take a moment to help you realize that beyond five letter phase, it is a feeling that runs within all the students.
18/12/23, 15:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to is the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù
18/12/23, 15:52 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
18/12/23, 15:54 - Phyllis EWYL23E0281: Okay mam
18/12/23, 15:54 - Phyllis EWYL23E0281: I will try not to skip
18/12/23, 15:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, I understand that you are facing network issues but we have to find some alternate to that like connecting from someone else's device or using hotspot.
18/12/23, 15:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Were you able to add me to the community building group?
18/12/23, 16:00 - Phyllis EWYL23E0281: Yh sure
18/12/23, 16:00 - Phyllis EWYL23E0281: I did tt
18/12/23, 16:01 - Phyllis EWYL23E0281: And I have a few students who have filled those forms so what am l supposed to do with them can l send them to yu
18/12/23, 16:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, send it to me on the EWYL Group, I am excited to receive them
18/12/23, 16:07 - Phyllis EWYL23E0281: Okay mam
18/12/23, 16:14 - Saloni Rastogi: I have received them, and will share my feedback there. So may I know what is the plan now for the project, like how do you plan to accelerate it?
18/12/23, 21:07 - Phyllis EWYL23E0281: I just wish l can keep spreading the message till the Edofian community is full
19/12/23, 08:42 - Phyllis EWYL23E0281: I am a proud edoofian
19/12/23, 08:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

üöÄ Brace yourself for a lesson sprinkled with knowledge and a dash of holiday cheer! üéÑüéÅ

Today's Wednesday Wisdom is not just special but carries a powerful reminder of the true essence of Christmas. As we stand on the brink of the festive season, it's crucial to reflect on the values that unite us as a community.

Beyond the glittering lights and festive decorations, Christmas serves as a poignant reminder of the core values that bind humanity together. It's a time when love, compassion, and generosity take center stage, fostering a sense of togetherness and shared joy.

Let's take a moment today to embrace the spirit of Christmas, appreciating the significance of our connections with one another. The lessons learned during this festive season go beyond the celebration itself, leaving a lasting impact on the way we interact with those around us.

May this Wednesday Wisdom inspire you to carry the spirit of Christmas not just during the holiday season but throughout the year! üéÑ‚ú®

Wishing you a joyous and reflective Wednesday!

Warm regards,

How are you?
27/09/23, 16:56 - Saloni Rastogi: Before we begin, as you have come on the EWYL Line, you have already completed some basic formalities. Now, I would like to talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.

I kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let me know.
28/09/23, 13:41 - Phyllis EWYL23E0281: I think we can put the  programme on hold because the student is not available  till 20 November after her final exams
28/09/23, 13:41 - Phyllis EWYL23E0281: But my question is  before we put it on hold  does this doesn't have ripple effects  on the programme?
28/09/23, 13:41 - Phyllis EWYL23E0281: Again after putting it on hold  should I continue sending the  I am a proud EDOOFIAN message in the group everyday
