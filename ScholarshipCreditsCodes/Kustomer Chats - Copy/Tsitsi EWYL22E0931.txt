YouTube is used to show your talents , what you can do and sharing of important information and additionally its used as a side hustle getting income. As a journalist, my mission has always been clear: to disseminate information and help people navigate the complexities of the world around them. This journey began right out of high school when I embarked on an insightful adventure as a Writer/Editor at Techzim, where I delved deep into the realms of Zimbabwe's startup and tech ecosystem from early 2018 until the close of 2020. Those three years not only honed my skills but also i gnited a passion for showcasing the untold stories of my homeland. Leaving my post at Techzim marked a new chapter. It was time to take t he reins and initiate my own venture, Untold ZW. With Story Untold, we set out on a mission to interview Zimbabwean entrepreneurs, creatives, and athletes, and bring their narratives to the forefront.The birth of Story Untold ZW saw me don a new hat – that of a Founder. Here, I established and managed a digital media platform that spotlights the inspiring stories of Zimbabweans from diverse backgrounds. We crafted, edited, and distributed video content across platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram, touching hearts and inspiring minds. Our success was a testament to our ability to build and maintain crucial relationships with clients, sponsors, and partners, and our growth was notable, with a 420% expansion in our Instagram audience base within just six months, primarily through word-of-mouth and online marketing.

Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

07/02/23, 18:58 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr

Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”
