23/06/23, 17:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Edoofian,
We hope this message finds you well in your academic pursuits. We are excited to share a Saturday activity centered around learning from influential personalities. Our chosen figure is Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of Liberia and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Through her remarkable leadership and unwavering determination, she has left an indelible mark on history. Let's draw valuable lessons from her life for our personal development.

Two traits that stand out about Ellen Johnson Sirleaf are resilience and visionary leadership. These qualities can greatly contribute to our growth and development as individuals. They can positively impact our academic pursuits, relationships, and future career goals.

To develop resilience, we can learn from Sirleaf's ability to bounce back from challenges. We can seek out difficult experiences and learn from them, cultivating a mindset of perseverance and adaptability.

Here are some suggestions to help you get started:

Identify two traits: Reflect on Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's qualities that resonate with you.

Reflect on personal development: Consider how these traits can positively impact your academic pursuits, relationships, or future career goals.

Create an action plan: Outline practical steps like seeking mentorship, practicing self-discipline, engaging in community service, or pursuing relevant courses and extracurricular activities.
Let's embark on this exciting journey together and make Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's legacy an integral part of our own lives.
Best regards,

Team Edoofa

26/06/23, 17:54 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, and good day!
I hope you had a wonderful weekend.

In today's session of the EWYL Line, we have an exciting topic to discuss: your understanding of the Weekend activity and project update. It's important to actively participate and share your response or understanding during the session or before it starts. Remember, this is your chance to contribute and make the most of our time together. So, let's dive in and make this session a productive and engaging one!
26/06/23, 17:55 - Saloni Rastogi: UPDATE
Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for the time being. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.

In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
26/06/23, 17:57 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: Alright ma'am
26/06/23, 17:57 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: As you had said to me that I should look for the contact details of my principal. I got the details
26/06/23, 17:59 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: As for the community building project I'm working on it
26/06/23, 18:17 - Saloni Rastogi: For the community building project, tel me these:
1. You have formed the group?
2. How many unique students are you adding daily to the group?
3. How frequently are you updating the group with information about Edoofa?
4. How many forms are you planning to bring in a week?
26/06/23, 18:18 - Saloni Rastogi: For the schools, may I know:
1. Which school's contact details did you get?
2. Have you shared the introductory message with them?
3. Have you shared the important messages with them about Edoofa?
4. Do you visit schools physically or though whatsapp?
26/06/23, 18:19 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: 1. Yes
2.Usually 2 or 3 
3.Everyday
4.5 forms
26/06/23, 18:21 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: 1.My school
2.Not yet
3. No
4.Through WhatsApp
26/06/23, 18:35 - Saloni Rastogi: So for community building:
1) Keep the group updated DAILY.
2) Try reaching out to students from different schools 
3) Try reaching out to teachers from your school or others and ask them to share the link to your WhatsApp group with other school teachers from different schools
4) In the group just:
-please give 'only admins' access
-just ask the students/participants to DM you to know about Edoofa and to get the form
-once they DM you, share about Edoofa with them
-Before sharing the form, ask them to get you added to their school groups
-once they do that, then only share the form with them.​
​5) Use social media as your sword to tell people about Edoofa
6) Use Facebook groups, I am sharing a screenshot that will help you understand that there are various groups on Facebook that you can join and share information about Edoofa also forward the link to your WhatsApp group there.
26/06/23, 18:35 - Saloni Rastogi: Check this
26/06/23, 18:37 - Saloni Rastogi: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
26/06/23, 18:37 - Saloni Rastogi: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
26/06/23, 18:38 - Saloni Rastogi: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!

Hope you are doing well.

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
26/06/23, 18:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Do you have the important resources to be shared with school?
27/06/23, 12:36 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: I am a proud Edoofian
27/06/23, 12:36 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

28/06/23, 16:02 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

29/06/23, 18:41 - Saloni Rastogi: I am sharing standard information with you for the grant document shared yesterday. Make sure you have your full attention.
29/06/23, 18:41 - Saloni Rastogi: In these 21 days, I want that we engage in the best possible manner to bring out fruitful results.

So this time you have to be *REGULAR IN YOUR SESSIONS*


Before we begin, let's go over what a complete session involves. 📚

▪️ First of all, you have to *come to the EWYL LINE every single day and tell me HOW PROUD ARE YOU being an Edoofian* (Including Sundays and even on days you don't have your session). This means _following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' without fail on the EWYL Line._

▪️ Secondly, It's essential to *arrive on time for the session*, as being late will not be considered as attending a session. _This brings the importance of being punctual for the session._

▪️ During our sessions, we'll cover two key topics: the *Wednesday Lesson or Weekend Activity* and *Project Updates*


To ensure your progress, I will ask for your Lessons or Activities submissions during the session. It's essential to be prepared and ready to share your work when prompted.🎓
29/06/23, 18:42 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: I'm following
29/06/23, 18:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Now, let's talk about a challenge that is included in the above-mentioned Project Update! ✈️
I have set a target for the next 21 days, which involves sharing:


*45 Community Building forms*
and
*2 School Connect forms*


To mark a session as completed, your active presence is required throughout our session time. If you encounter any network or mobile issues, I recommend addressing them beforehand so that we can make the most of our time together.

Remember, excuses won't be accepted because I believe in your determination.
29/06/23, 18:44 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: Alright ma'am thank you I make sure to do my best
29/06/23, 18:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Coming to the point that you might have also noticed and something that brings a flavor to this challenge is Extra Curricular activity


When it comes to overall assessment and evaluation, we believe it's not just about projects and lessons. It's about how passionate you are about yourself. Therefore, there is another aspect for evaluation, which is extracurricular activities.

In the next 21 days, It's your turn to show your amazing talent and be better than all the other students in this thrilling competition. Show everyone what you can do and make them amazed by your skills.

As your mentor, I want you to tell me about what else you are good at besides academics and share your idea of how you will showcase that talent to us.
29/06/23, 19:08 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: I'm good at drawing and singing.
30/06/23, 14:27 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: I'm a proud Edoofian

03/07/23, 13:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!

How are you?
Please share your progress on the following:
~ Weekend Activity

~ Project Update : No of form you will be sharing this week and how are you working towards it?
03/07/23, 13:16 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: I'm fine ma'am, how are you?
03/07/23, 13:23 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: For my weekend activity I was looking at influencial personalities but I just went back through to the story of Ellen Jonhson Sirleaf.
03/07/23, 13:26 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: For project updates. This week I will be submitting 10 forms for student application. Two forms of two school heads. I'm saying this because I'm seeing progress in all my session that I'm interacting with students and heads. I just hope by the end of this week I will be able to deliver them all to you.
03/07/23, 13:36 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing good, thank you

Agutha you know why you have not received the weekend activity?
03/07/23, 13:38 - Saloni Rastogi: That is great, do you require any help from my end as to communicating with students or with Schools heads?
03/07/23, 13:38 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: No I don't know ma'am.
03/07/23, 13:39 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: For now ma'am everything is going well, but when I need some help I definitely ask you
03/07/23, 13:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Agutha every day in the morning you are supposed to follow the daily ritual

You followed the ritual on 1st, but late in the night
03/07/23, 13:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
03/07/23, 13:53 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
03/07/23, 13:57 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: I will do exactly just that, thank you ma'am
03/07/23, 13:57 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: Yes that's very correct ma'am
03/07/23, 14:04 - Agutha EWYL22E1314: I have always wanted to become a person person to help other people by sharing the little knowledge that I have. All because of Edoofa it's now a dream come true because I'm helping students to join this amazing program. With all this I will happily say *that* *I* *am* *a* *proud* *Edoofian*.
03/07/23, 14:12 - Saloni Rastogi: That's really awesome Agutha!

I am sharing the weekend activity especially with you, I generally don't share it with my other students
Make sure you share your understanding on it within the session
