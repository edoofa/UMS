22/01/24, 15:35 - Richmore EWYL23E0931: Hello my dear mam Aditi
22/01/24, 15:40 - Aditi Kapoor: Good day!âœ¨
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?
22/01/24, 15:40 - Richmore EWYL23E0931: Yes am ready mam
22/01/24, 15:44 - Aditi Kapoor: We'll be beginning our new journey toward this earning and learning opportunity and I want you to commence with lots of enthusiasm and willingness to work hard to achieve your dreams as you wanted to build a community and I highly think of this as a great aspiration for giving back to the society and I am sure that this EWYL journey will not only help you to earn Scholarship credits but also upskill you and make you stand out from others and I want to make sure that you excel in all aspects of this journey.
22/01/24, 15:45 - Richmore EWYL23E0931: Yes that's the spirit my dear
22/01/24, 15:48 - Aditi Kapoor: I'm eager to know what thrilling plans you have in store as you kick off your journey with these projects! What's your exciting plan of action?
22/01/24, 15:50 - Richmore EWYL23E0931: Plans for carrying out the projects or what? Am not getting you pardon me
22/01/24, 15:55 - Aditi Kapoor: Richmore, the projects we discussed on the EWYL Group, you forgot too soon?
22/01/24, 15:59 - Richmore EWYL23E0931: Not as such mam

Ok as for now my plan is to connect with the Head of Chibuwe High so that he may guide me through the process of getting permission from the DSI of chipinge.
22/01/24, 16:00 - Aditi Kapoor: That sounds like a well-thought-out plan. Connecting with the Head of Chibuwe High and seeking guidance on obtaining permission from the DSI of Chipinge is a strategic move. Their insights and assistance will likely streamline the process and ensure that all necessary steps are taken.
22/01/24, 16:03 - Richmore EWYL23E0931: Yes my dear, because the head of Mafumise High School deleted the onformation he had sent responding to tha form saying I must have permission to do so by the DSI and he sent me his contact. I got in touch with the DSI and he advised me to get advice and guidance from the Head of Chibuwe High and he shared his contact with me
22/01/24, 16:09 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, although I think that Chibuwe High is already connected with Edoofa, so it won't be an issue for you.
22/01/24, 16:10 - Richmore EWYL23E0931: Ok. So now my targets are those in Chimanimani and some of those in Chipinge like Gaza, Herentials and so forth
22/01/24, 16:12 - Aditi Kapoor: Awesome!
22/01/24, 16:14 - Richmore EWYL23E0931: Yes my dear
22/01/24, 16:16 - Aditi Kapoor: And what about the community building project?
22/01/24, 16:17 - Richmore EWYL23E0931: Once I get permission to reach these schools, it will be easy for me to build community since I will recruit the students of those schools.
22/01/24, 16:36 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, but I feel that independent of that you shall start from your own schools and your peers for the project.
22/01/24, 16:38 - Richmore EWYL23E0931: Yah my School is Mafumise high. So I need first to convince the Head the rest will be a walk over.
22/01/24, 16:42 - Aditi Kapoor: Richmore, I think so that's great idea but if you might have any friends in school, you can start with the community building project by adding them in the Whatsapp Community Building group.
22/01/24, 16:44 - Richmore EWYL23E0931: Ok just my dear, let me try to look for them beacuse I finished my A level in 2020
22/01/24, 16:54 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay.
22/01/24, 17:04 - Aditi Kapoor: So we are wrapping up for today and look forward to connecting in our next session with more enthusiasm.ðŸŒº
22/01/24, 17:12 - Richmore EWYL23E0931: Thanks mam. Have aa  wonderful day
