24/04/23, 22:20 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: Greetings Ms jasmine I am EPHINAS NYAWALI and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My group name is Ephinas EWYL 23E0036 I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN.
24/04/23, 22:20 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, ready for a motivational monday?

In a remote village, there lives a hardworking farmer who owns a farm. Over the years his grapery yields rich crops, and the farmer is very successful. He has three sons, who are young and energetic but never worry about working. As the farmer grows older, he begins to worry about his sons‚Äô future.

Then he becomes very ill and feels that his death is coming soon. He calls his sons and says,

‚ÄúDear sons, I see my death approaching, but I want to share a secret before you all leave. These areas have treasure hidden inside. Dig the whole area after my death, to find it. ‚Äù

The old farmer died. The sons start digging for money without leaving any part of the field but nothing is found. In any case, digging their fields leads to healthier crops and results in higher incomes. These earnings make the sons realize what their father means.

What according to you is the moral of the story?

a. Hard work always pays off. The fruits of hard work are always sweet.
b. Be Selflessly kind
c. both a & b
24/04/23, 22:25 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: a.is the answer

01/05/23, 16:39 - Jasmine Kaur: That's great. Now Ephinas
Have you started working on the projects?
01/05/23, 16:40 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: Yes so far I've been researching on the first project for finding a company
01/05/23, 16:41 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, Have you managed to get any form Ephinas?
01/05/23, 16:44 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: And then the other one where I have to form a group and add students is tricky because most of the students are still in school and haven't yet graduated and I  don't know if you are aware that now most schools in zambia have free education, and there are only few schools that require students to pay which makes it difficult even when a student enrolls as an Edoofa student to pay the first part of the fee. I don't know if you understand my concerns
01/05/23, 16:47 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: No bot yet and I'm having challenges on the procedure on how to get the forms
01/05/23, 16:48 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, I actually understand Ephinas and I have already discussed this with my team too. You can definitely submit the forms of the schools that offer free education. Now, can you do the project dear?
01/05/23, 16:49 - Jasmine Kaur: Students who are looking forward to going to the university next year. You have to talk to them and tell them the benefits. Every message is shared with you on the WhatsApp group and then you have to tell the student to fill the form.
01/05/23, 16:49 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: Okay so I have to contact head teachers
01/05/23, 16:50 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: Okay thankyou understood
01/05/23, 16:51 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes for Project 3, you have to contact the head teachers and for Project 2 Community Building, you have to contact the students.
01/05/23, 16:57 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: Okay I'll look get numbers of different head teachers on different media platforms
01/05/23, 16:59 - Jasmine Kaur: That's great
Now, I want to give you a target that you have to submit 10 forms by Saturday. Will you be able to do that?
01/05/23, 16:59 - Jasmine Kaur: You can work on any of the three projects Ephinas
01/05/23, 17:08 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: Okay I'll put in effort
01/05/23, 17:09 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: Okay thankyou
02/05/23, 17:07 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: Good afternoon. I'M A PROUD EDOOFIAN.
02/05/23, 17:07 - Jasmine Kaur: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.

Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell:

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges.
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
 3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
02/05/23, 17:22 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: The answer is 4.
03/05/23, 17:07 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: Good afternoon.  I'M A PROUD EDOOFIAN.

12/05/23, 16:00 - Jasmine Kaur: `- That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!`

`- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.``- How do you intend to broaden this student community? 

In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.
12/05/23, 16:01 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: Sure
13/05/23, 03:26 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: In our daily life, we make alot of decisions in which some are good, whereas some are bad. There are alot of factors we need to consider when making decisions, whether good or bad.
One of the factors you have to consider to make a good decision is to think about your goals and values. The goal that you have set for a particular thing. Then the values, what values are you going to earn when you make a certain decision. Secondly, the other important factor that you have to consider before you make a good decision is that you have to use the information available.  By that I mean you have to research about the challenge that you're facing, after that you be able to make a good decision and conclusion. The other factor you have to consider before making a good decision is prejudice. You as a person you are not suppose to judge the situation in advance before you even research. There is a proverb which says do not judge a book by its cover which I personally consider to be very important. You first have to look into a situation before you make a final decision. The other factor that you have to consider before you make a good decision is that do not let stress get the best of you. I have noticed that many of us people, when we are making decisions we are mostly stressed because we do not know the possible outcomes to the decision we make. So we should not let stress get into our way. 
There are alot of factors that can make us make very bad decisions.  As I have discussed above on the good factors, the negative response to the good factors is a result of bad decisions. I personally will tell you a story of how I made a good and bad decision. Firstly  when I was a student in my high school, we had this program called PREP where all the students have to study for like 2 hours and it was compulsory.  So one day I decided not to attend PREP  and do my laundry.  I later on came to realize that I made a very bad decision. The for the good decisions I took part in different activities like club and sports.

18/05/23, 13:57 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: Good morning, today I'm sharing with you what I learned from our Edoofa founders who came to visit us in zambia. I firstly would like to appreciate their visitation, I learned alot from them. After reading this Wednesday wisdom document I have have noticed that our leaders the founder of Edoofa, have all the characteristics of a good leader needed by the community.  Firstly I noticed that they are good listeners because they gave a chance to parents and students to ask questions. And I was very happy to see that they had addressed the questions very well to the satisfaction of the parents and us students.  As a proud edoofian who we'll be a leader in future, its very important to adopt this characteristic of being a good leader. Secondly, I learned that our great leaders (founders of Edoofa) are servant leaders.  They focus on serving people and sharing their leadership power so that the community can grow. This inspires me to be a servant leader too so that I can serve people and not just focus on thriving the organization but also being passionate in making a difference in people's lives. I would like to share with you the short experience I've had since the time I joined this community.  So far it has taught me to be hardworking and especially being punctuation for sessions, weather with the counselor or my mentor. And this is really a positive change in my life. Apart from that I also learned that our leaders the founders of Edoofa Mr Angad Singh and Mr Avreen Singh have effortless commitment to making this community grow so that many live lives can be helped.  They have done this by visiting different nations to Educate and help them understand about the importance of hard work and higher education. They have a sense of building  community building. In conclusion I  wish for this community to keep growing and I am a proud edoofian.

22/05/23, 16:37 - Jasmine Kaur: Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Alex who loved playing the piano. Despite facing financial hardships, he practiced on an old, worn-out piano every day. His passion and dedication led him to enter a prestigious music competition.

a) Winning a sports competition
b) Receiving an art scholarship
c) Participating in a theater production
d) Entering a prestigious music competition
22/05/23, 16:40 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: d.
22/05/23, 16:40 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: Hello jasmine I'm having a challenge on the app you told me to download yesterday on play store
24/05/23, 15:08 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036: So this question is talking about leadership and how we can become leaders through the EWYL projects that were given to us by our mentors. So through this program and the projects that wr have been given, they can help us to be good leaders by executing them. As a leader you have to think critically on how you can execute a plan, this also applies to the projects that were have been given, we have to try by all means and make sure that by the end of the day the projects are executed.  The other thing that can help us be good leaders through the projects is a good communication skills.  During the EWYL program our mentors advise us to be have good communication, by good communication I mean we should learn how to communicate to different groups of people.  And good communication is one of the most important skills a good leader has to attain.  The other thing that can help is to be good leaders through the EWYL projects is through perseverance. We might face some challenges in executing the projects but as a leader you have to perseve and not to give up. The other thing that can help us to be good leaders through the EWYL projects is commitment.  As a good leader you have to be committed to the task that you are assigned to do.

24/05/23, 16:49 - Jasmine Kaur: Well done dear
Here is your lesson of the week

‚ÄúWhen I discover who I am, I'll be free.‚Äù ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, learn more about your own self, and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning. 
Deadline - 26th May 2023
