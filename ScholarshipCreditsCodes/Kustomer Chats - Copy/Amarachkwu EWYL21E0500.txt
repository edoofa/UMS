06/08/22, 22:56 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: I AM  A PROUD EUDOOFIAN
08/08/22, 17:00 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: I  AM A PROUD EUDOOFIAN
12/08/22, 22:40 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: I AM A PROUD EUDOOFIAN
12/08/22, 22:40 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: *Wednesday Wisdom*
12/08/22, 22:40 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: Sorry i had to submit it late
15/08/22, 22:43 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: *Wednesday wisdom (17\/08\/2022)*
15/08/22, 22:43 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: 1.A SUCCESS MANTRA THAT SUITS MY PERSONALITY AND THAT I HAVE MASTERED ON THE LAST WEEKS ASSIGNMENT:

ln the last weeks assignment I’ve mastered *STOP FIXATING ON FAILURE *
Failure can just be being unable to complete or pass a certain situation,circumstance or goal.But I’ve realised that with commitment there’s no real failure.We fail to learn and learning something new is an achievement,so I’ve learned not to be afraid to fail because its failure that helps one realize where they are going wrong.Failure opens up to correction.
So I’ve focused on organization ,planning and goal setting on my success in life .So to accomplish this ive also set aside my correction bookin which as i fail i write what I’ve learnt and think of ways to correct them
15/08/22, 23:22 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: *2.A SUCCESS HABIT THAT I WISH TO DEVELOP THIS YEAR TO MASTER IT BY THE END OF THE YEAR:*

Learni how to spend 15 to 30 minutes each day on focused thinking

Many of the self-made successful people usually say they make time to process everything that’s going on in their lives.

“The rich tend to think in isolation, in the mornings and for at least 15 minutes every day.”

Often they’ll reflect on their career, their health and their personal relationships. Having quiet time to analyze your thoughts is associated with stress reduction.

So for me to be more successful creating the thinking habit  is what i wish to master by the end of the year
15/08/22, 23:22 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: *3. MY ROLE MODEL AND THE SUCCESS BEHAVIORS I ADMIRE MOST:*

My dad is my role model, why?
-He wakes up early 3hrs before his work day actually starts. He uses his free time in the morning to tackle personal projects, plan his day or make time fr exercise.He gets up to tuckle the top 3 things he wants to accomplish in the day so that he regains control of his life. It gives him a sense of confidence that he indeed directs his life.
-he reads alot, my dad devotes at least 30 mins for reading, which he says gives him self improvement,in business, intellectually,socially,spiritually,health wise and many more.To gain these he mostly reads biographies,history and self help books.
-He meditates,my dad meditates every evening . He recalls every mistake he does on a particular day and find solutions through meditation.
-He makes exercise priority 
My dad never forgets to exercise, because he says it helps him clear his head and makes him feel motivated and energized.
-Lastly he spends most of his time with people who inspires him.As a businessman he’s motivated to do more ,act on more and create more when very successful man than him are around him,being around him challenges him to learn so as to reach their level
15/08/22, 23:22 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: So these are some reasons why my dad is my role model
15/08/22, 23:22 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: Thank you

12/07/22, 18:21 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: *Weekend activity*
HOW TO GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN PROJECTS AND EARN MORE CREDITS:

To be given a chance to participate in projects and earn more credits one has to be consistent in doing their projects.Projects should always be submitted on time,and even before the assigned deadline,it would show great consistency.
One should be passionate with what they do,love what you do,it is what gives you willpower to push you to do work whole heartedly and pushes you to go an extra mile to work.
Be a student whose ready for a  challenge,who believes in their ability to solve a problem whether hard or easy.
One has to be diligent and has to learn to embrace themselves.
One has to be creative,to think outside the given box,its not only to solve a problem one has to do alone one has to give ideas to open up new ideas,one has to be a critical thinker.ln short one has to develop tge project assigned.
Lastely a person should make use of every opportunity that comes their way,make use of getting projects to learn,improve oneself,ability and tginking and use the opportunity to develop what they are given
12/07/22, 18:21 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: Morning maam
12/07/22, 21:23 - Unknown: Good afternoon Amarachkwu!
How's your day going?
12/07/22, 21:23 - Unknown: First, I am so happy to see your understanding of being a proud edoofian.
12/07/22, 21:25 - Unknown: I read your response to the Wednesday lesson, and I must say that your opinions and views reflect clarity of idea. Not just this, your simplified understanding of our  young African entrepreneur,
*Oluwadamilola Soyombo* assures me that you have that zeal and passion to turn your dreams and ambitions into a _big successful reality_. 
The main idea behind this is to realize that where there is a DESIRE to work hard, there is always a PATH that can take you to favorable outcomes. I know you are putting in all your efforts and I very well appreciate them, but I know you are capable to do much more than this, it is just about taking one more step ahead of others that will make you outshine in this crowd of millions of people.
This project also highlighted Edoofa's Training and Development partner Skooqs.
12/07/22, 21:26 - Unknown: I am really glad to hear your understanding of the weekend activity as well. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY* . They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost up, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.

14/07/22, 22:42 - Unknown: Hello my proud EDOOFIAN!

From his dad’s small foray into entrepreneurship, Patrice Motsepe got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe’s success story is a remarkable one showing how curiosity, doggedness, perseverance, and the knack to exploit great opportunities as they come, can determine how successful or not, any individual could become. 
And this was all about our WEDNESDAY WISDOM.
Hope you have gone through it.
I am so excited to listen to your thoughts and views here.
21/07/22, 03:36 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: How are you maam
21/07/22, 04:08 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: I have a request,,,will u please excuse me for a little while I've been having pressure with my documents lately,concerning my travel
21/07/22, 04:09 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: Will you please give me time, so that i get my things ready and so that i don't feel too pressured
21/07/22, 22:03 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Amarachkwu!
How's your day going?
21/07/22, 22:11 - Unknown: I totally understand that Amarachkwu, you must be so occupied in your preparation because you will be leaving your Homeland for such a long duration, and of course, you have to make sure that you are fully prepared and loaded with all the necessities. Take your time Amarachkwu, and you always know that I am not just your mentor imparting you with knowledge and skills on a daily basis but my role is also to understand you as a friend and provide you with solutions to all your concerns and queries. 
I can understand that submitting a response at times can be difficult but I want us to stay connected every day. So I feel the best solution to it is that every day you come to the EWYL Line and follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud EDOOFIAN'. In this way, we will stay connected each day and I will be able to have quick updates on your preparation and progress. What do you think?
22/07/22, 03:57 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: I AM A PROUD EUDOFIAN
22/07/22, 03:57 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: Good morning,,,i just want to thank you for standing up for me and helping me by requesting for an extension so that i reach the $150 for my enrollment,

22/07/22, 03:57 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: Thank you so much,
22/07/22, 04:45 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: its a great idea
22/07/22, 04:45 - Amarachkwu EWYL21E0500: Im in acceptance with what u have said maam

22/07/22, 05:44 - Unknown: Amarachkwu can you please share the certificate that you got from the meet and greet with me, please.

23/07/22, 04:02 - Unknown: Okay, no worries.
23/07/22, 21:01 - Unknown: Greetings Amarachkwu!
 Please share the certificate that you got from the meet and greet with me.
25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!
