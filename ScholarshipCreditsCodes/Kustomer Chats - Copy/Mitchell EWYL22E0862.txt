01/04/23, 00:42 - Unknown: Dear Students,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and let you know that I was overwhelmed by the response from students during my recent university visit. While I was thrilled to see so many of my students, I am currently working on performance evaluation of each one of them. Hence I would like to inform you that I will not be able to attend to your queries during the weekend that is tomorrow and day after. 

However, I would like to assure you that I will be available to connect with you in our upcoming session on Monday\/Tuesday. Please make sure you mark your calendars and plan to attend that session so we can address any questions or concerns you may have and proceed with our discussions then.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. I am looking forward to our next session and I hope to see you all there.

Till then take care and don’t forget to work on your pending activities from this month.","transform":"

24/04/23, 13:22 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, ready for a motivational monday?

In a remote village, there lives a hardworking farmer who owns a farm. Over the years his grapery yields rich crops, and the farmer is very successful. He has three sons, who are young and energetic but never worry about working. As the farmer grows older, he begins to worry about his sons’ future.

Then he becomes very ill and feels that his death is coming soon. He calls his sons and says,

“Dear sons, I see my death approaching, but I want to share a secret before you all leave. These areas have treasure hidden inside. Dig the whole area after my death, to find it. ”

The old farmer died. The sons start digging for money without leaving any part of the field but nothing is found. In any case, digging their fields leads to healthier crops and results in higher incomes. These earnings make the sons realize what their father means.

What according to you is the moral of the story?

a. Hard work always pays off. The fruits of hard work are always sweet.
b. Be Selflessly kind
c. both a & b

26/04/23, 16:57 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Last week we learnt about first 6 principles from the book- Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. Today’s Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the remaining principles. Ready to learn in detail?

The book outlines specific principles and strategies that successful people have used to achieve their goals. By following these principles, readers can create a roadmap for their own success. I believe, reading "Think and Grow Rich" can provide readers with the mindset, motivation, and strategies needed to achieve success in any area of life. Let us discuss in detail about your learnings in our upcoming scheduled session. 

Happy Learning
