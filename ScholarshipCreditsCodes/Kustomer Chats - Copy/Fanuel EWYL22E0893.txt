19/04/23, 20:17 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: Lorna's success story taught me a lot and l would also want to relate problems in Lorna's   community to be almost the same as mine. I was also inspired that someone can make money and even become an employer.
So l did an investigation in our community to see the environmental problems.l identified the prevailing problems to be  air pollution , land pollution and global warming .Air pollution is being caused by the everyday increase of vehicle population, burning of garbage and industrial emmissions.To curb for this problem l encourage use of cleaner energy sources like solar energy in industries .Also garbage must be sorted and sent for recycling other than burning it. I also see a bin model made from car tyres best to carry litter other than burning old tyres.The bins can be made by welding metal and piling the tyres around the metal and paint them aftewards.This produces good , beautiful and durable bins which can also be sold for a profit by selling them to different homes.This measures curb for both land pollution and air pollution.Last but not least is the worldwide problem of global warming.It is being caused by burning of fossil fuels releasing smoke in the air and also smoke from vehicles.A possible measure to reduce global warming is shifting to the use of hybrid cars that produce less exhaust smoke and promoting public transport.Also l encourage use of biogas and electrification of rural homes to minimize the use of firewood for cooking.Last but not least growing crops in greenhouses where the internal conditions are controlled is the best way as crops can be grown all the year without following the seasons.It also produces hybrid crops and also higher profits are earned.

21/04/23, 15:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Our weekly Wednesday wisdom focussed on Napolean Hill's 13 Principles of Success and it deeply talked about 6 such principles that can make you think out of the box.

In our session today on the EWYL Line, we will discuss:
1) What all you learned from those principles?
2) Project Update
21/04/23, 15:44 - Saloni Rastogi: I have seen the Saturday activity response, and you have explained it very well, but please, do not share the response late. I will not accept it from this time onwards.
21/04/23, 15:49 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: I am good  ma'am how are you?
21/04/23, 15:49 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: Ok understood by the time l did the activity the EWYL line had not been fixed yet.
21/04/23, 16:21 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing good, thank you.
21/04/23, 16:22 - Saloni Rastogi: No worries Fanuel.
Before we discuss about the Africna School Reform Mission Project can you share with me what all have you understood from the Wednesday lesson?
21/04/23, 16:54 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: The principles of success surely help as l learnt a lot from them.Starting from the first point *DESIRE* , l learnt that you first must have the desire for then after you can work on a plan to achieve the desire and complete your mission.Desire guides you as you work hard being guided by an objective.
2) *FAITH* , Faith programs the mind that the desire is achievable.Though sometimes the mind can be negative faith gives the power to improve on the negatives and  build up focus .To have enough faith the mind is reprogrammed to a positive mindset that gives a person strength to keep on trying even after a failure knowing that one day success will be reached. Visualization of and belief of desire in attainment of desire also increases a person's confidence which is also a bigger step to being successful.
 3 ) *Auto Suggestion*, This further creates a positive mindset and  puts the thought into reality by repeating and memorising your desire
4) *Specialized knowledge* , this pushes for a research to attain knowledge that helps you to be successful focusing on the desire.This point helps you gather more and enough knowledge in the area ,it may be by association of individuals in the field.
5) *Imagination*  , This helps have a flexible mindset for planning.It helps you think of new ideas and upgrading the old ones.This helps see your desire on a larger perspective and focus on building it and becoming successful.
6 ) *Organised Planning*  , This helps put the plan into action and obvious for  a bigger thing you can not do it alone so you have to choose the suitable partners.You will be the mastermind so you will be more like a leader others waiting for instructions from you
21/04/23, 16:55 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: 2 ) For my project there  are two heads that l am looking forward to have discussions with but they are still to make time for the discussions as they seem very busy with workshops and stuff.
21/04/23, 16:55 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: That's great ma'am

25/04/23, 14:36 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: Napoleon Hill outlined 13 principles to that help achieve success and wealth .I am going to emphasize on 6 principles outlining how useful they may be.
 
 *DESIRE* ,  Desire is the starting point of all achievement.The desire is the most powerful motivation a human being can have . Growing rich doesn't happen with wishing , It happens with a strong, intense and obsessive desire that  is transformed into hardwork.Weak desire gives weak results and vice-versa to a greater desire.The desire for Thomas Bata to supply canvas shoes around the world were fruitful though at sometimes the company closed but he kept on working hard to achieve his desire.Nowadays Bata shoe company is one of the most recognized shoe companies that are known for producing quality brands.Sometimes a desire cannot be fruitful because of lack of resources but to achieve your desire greater patience must be exercised.

 *FAITH* , faith is the motivating force for individuals to take action.Faith defines a state of mind which may be induced ,or created , by affirmation , or repeated instructions to the subconscious mind .It makes the mind ready to go all the way to reach success nomatter what circumstances.Bill lrvine started his company with his wife using their spare bedroom but now produces over 15 000 tonnes of chicken per year.All this was a result of faith and their mission statement ," We change lives in Africa by producing affordable  protein and growing businesses ".Faith must be put into action with hardwork  , there are no results in faith without hardwork .

 *AUTOSUGGESTION* , lt is how we inspire desire within ourselves.You can feed your subconscious mind  voluntarily using autosuggestion as the agent of action.It is how you can grow the garden of your mind by planting seeds of the beauty you wish to see there.There you can grow a bounty of beauty or weeds .By consciously visualising your success you trigger your subconscious imagination to deliver you the plans that get you to your goal.The concept of autosuggestion was used by the owners of Nandos that to have more reputable restaurants they used their own unique recipe of peri peri grilled chicken and some hot dishes that are different from their competitor brands . Autosuggestion must be quickly brought into practical by starting with the action right away for example one must say l am smart not l am going to be smart for the idea to be brought into reality , to achieve success and gain riches.

 *SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE* , The accumulation of great fortunes calls for POWER  , and power is acquired through organized and intelligently  directed specialized knowledge .That knowledge may not be in the individual who accumulates the riches but  can be acquired from other individuals that are already in the area.The way of success is the continuous pursuit of knowledge and may be in the form of theoretical knowledge and particular skills in a field.The 1960s were a huge time of growth for Toyota.They developed ties with Europe and started exporting vehicles there.This shows evidence of specialised knoledge where the Toyota company collaborated with others un the same field and have diverse knowledge to make better fortunes and that was fruitful .

 *IMAGINATION*  , The impulse, the desire  , is given shape ,form and action  through the aid of imagination faculty of mind.Through imagination the finite mind of man has direct communication with infinite intelligence.You formulate existing concepts ,ideas and plans into new forms .Popular Zimbabwean businessman Tinashe Mutarisi started his business with three employees and the company grew to 36 branches and more than 500 employees across Zimbabwe.With success of Nash paints , Mutarisi founded Nash holdings.A person must have a bigger imagination , and plans that make him pursue greater fortunes in the future .

 *ORGANIZED PLANNING* , this principle tells about creating a mastemind group.This group helps you to put your plan into action and communication must be good . You must choose a group with individuals with skills that you require and will help you earn a fortune and also have money to pay them to maintain the relations.A Scotsman named John Fairbarn started the Mutual Life Assurance Society of the Cape of Good Hope in 1845 in Capetown with no capital - just the trust of like minded individuals and the unwavering belief that together people can achieve more than alone.The company is now called Old Mutual.In organized planning the group must increase as the fortune increase  with time otherwise you may fail to pay other group members

01/05/23, 18:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

In our last Wednesday Wisdom lesson, we discussed the principles from the book "Think and Grow Rich" by Napoleon Hill.

Good luck, and I look forward to reading your submissions!
02/05/23, 16:00 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: I am a proud Edoodian
02/05/23, 16:01 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: Napoleon Hill's principles prove to be very useful if used in the correct way and one can earn a fortune from them.I am going to describe some of the principles.

 *DECISION* - Hill states that the most successful people make desicions quickly and definitely.Delay in making decisions is one of the leading causes of failure.Trusting your self is very important in making decisions and you must seek knowledge mainly from your trusted sources.Making others always decide for you can lead to failure as you are the one who knows your desire and to get your required fortune you are the master of your own destiny.

 *PERSISTENCE*  - persistence is the direct result of habit.The mind absorbs and becomes part of the daily experiences upon which it feeds.Fear ,the worst of all enemies can be effectively cured by forced repetition acts of courage.Persistence is an essential procedure of transmuting desire into its monetary equivalent.To be successful and gain riches one must have a mindset that tells to keep on trying and never give up.

 *POWER OF THE MASTERMIND* -  To acquire the power you must have to be ready to face your goals Hill states there are 3 ways which are Infinite intelligence, accumulated experience and experiment and research.Knowledge must be generated into power and one must find an appropriate mastermind group.Mastermind is the coordination of knowledge and effort between two or more people who work towards a definite purpose in a spirit of harmony.A mastermind group helps members to solve their problems with input and advice from other group members
02/05/23, 16:01 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: *THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND* - The subconscious is more receptive to thoughts that come accompanied by emotion.Emotionalised thoughts are transferred into action.Therefore positive emotions are vital for being successful and acquiring fortunes . Positive habits must be cultivated to have a subconscious mind that is postive and strong, in the future enabling you to plan accordingly and become successful.

 *THE BRAIN*  - Hill believes that the brain works on thoughts that have been stepped up and help put them to reality.One must cultivate positive and productive thoughts that help achieve your desire and become successful.

 *THE SIXTH SENSE* - the sixth sense is that part of the subconscious mind that is referred as creative imagination.It also the  receiving set of the brain where ideas,plans and thoughts flash into.The sixth sense is written to be a combination of the mentality and spirituality.It acts as an guardian angel .It is like an inner voice that tells you to sense danger and avoid making a bad decision and also tells you to grab an opportunity .

 *HOW TO  OUTWIT THE SIX GHOSTS OF* *FEAR*

Hill says fear is a state of mind and you would need to redirect your state of mind to conquer the fears.To overcome your fear and acquire your desire to gain riches you must shift from a negative point of view and do a positive action plan .Fear kills the creative imagination and can also alter personal persistence because of failures that are faced in the way and lead to poor decision making because a person will be in the wrong state of mind
02/05/23, 16:01 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: I find the principle of persistence very important and useful in my daily life . Everyday there are coincidences that happen that may act as a setback to you and hinder your success.It may be in academics or even sporting ,you always expect to be on top but sometimes things do not happen the way you had planned them.But with being persistent and telling yourself everyday that one day l will make it it will help you be successful and definitely that day will come but only through hardwork and rightful decision making.

05/05/23, 15:31 - Saloni Rastogi: Dear Proud Edoofian,

I hope you are doing well. This message serves as a gentle reminder for your Wednesday lesson. It is important to continue learning and developing your skills in order to advance in your career. Please take some time to go through the lesson, take notes on any important information, and complete the assigned tasks. Remember, investing in yourself is always a wise decision.

Happy learning!
05/05/23, 15:31 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: Good morning ma'am
05/05/23, 15:32 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: *The skill of critical thinking* 
This skill is very valuable and  a person who holds this skill has lesser problems as he makes minimum mistakes.An investigation , based on college students , by researchers at Stanford found that people do not multitask effectively . The researchers grouped the students as high multi taskers and low multi taskers.High multitaskers were found to score worse at distinguishing relevant and irrelevant information and ignoring the latter.Their minds were labeled as disorganized.Multitasking impairs your thinking abilities.High multi taskers have more disturbances therefore they have a lesser concentration.High concentration is needed to have good developed ideas and achieve your goal correcting any mistakes made .Slowing down and concentrating improves your thinking.To make a good decision, good writing and good thinking more time is needed for perfect results and as l said high concentration also improves the ability of thinking.Have little time for dedication  causes an accumulation of bad decisions.Good decision makers  make good decisions with good thinking and good thinking requires time.Good thinking is expensive and bad thinking costs a fortune

05/05/23, 16:18 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Fanuel!
How are you?
05/05/23, 16:18 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: I am doing good ma'am, how are you?
05/05/23, 16:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Due to the reconstruction of the EWYL Line platform, I was not able to find your account.
05/05/23, 16:20 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: Okay okay ma'am no worries
05/05/23, 16:21 - Saloni Rastogi: I am completely apologetic for this, I promise to make up to you now. Don't worry at all.
05/05/23, 16:21 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: It's okay ma'am, no problem at all.
05/05/23, 16:21 - Saloni Rastogi: You have highlighted some important points about critical thinking. It is true that this skill is valuable and can help minimize mistakes. The research you mentioned about multitasking also supports the idea that concentration and focus are essential for effective thinking.
05/05/23, 16:22 - Saloni Rastogi: I completely agree with your statement that good thinking requires time and that rushing can lead to bad decisions. Taking the time to slow down, concentrate, and reflect can help us generate better ideas and solutions. It's important to note that critical thinking also involves being open-minded, objective, and willing to consider multiple perspectives.
05/05/23, 16:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share with me any updates on the projects, Fanuel?

09/05/23, 15:48 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: We make decisions everyday in our life.They are good and bad decisions. A decision is of high quality to the extent that the decision maker knows what risks they are taking by making that decision.You know how good or bad the information is and the biased inherent in the reasoning.

Good decisions are very important in life.Making better decisions leads to better results and fewer repercussions.They leave you with more options and flexibility.In my life there was also some point l had to make very important decisions.Growing up l always dreamt of working in the medical and health industry.With time moving there was a point that l thought that the dream was no longer achievable.I would face a lot of negative facts from other students like Sciences were more difficult than other  subjects  and for me to excel better l would need to specialize more in commercials or arts.I chose sciences although l had my fears that l would drop them as l also saw it as reality as most students at our school would drop the subjects.l continued with the subjects and fortunately obtained passes and till now l am still in the journey of living my dream life.In that l learnt that sometimes you must ask ask successful people how they made it , and also consider those that were unsuccessful and try avoiding similar mistakes.In addition l also learnt ,you can use some negativity from people as your strength and build yourself up and prove that you can make it.

As people sometimes we also make bad decisions or bad choices.They lead to unpleasant results and disastrous consequences.Bad decisions affect one's life badly.If our decision, we have to repent for it because it ruins the countless happy moments of life. As young people the most bad decision l see being made by people as the same age as me is the choice of friends.Many associated with the wrong people and led to the deterioration of their standards and character.Most of our bad decisions occur because they feel comfortable and automatic.Our emotions steeer us incorrectly.Our perception of time is inaccurate and skewed towards the present.Usually bad decision makers point fingers and make excuses, setting themselves up for continued long -term failure.You must take responsibility for a bad decision , correct it and also learn from it.

To make sure that a good decision is made always they are factors which can be considered. These are personality, culture , information available and sometimes level of education.The decision to be made must be clearly identified and think about the positive and negative consequences after a choice is made.
09/05/23, 15:48 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: Greetings Ms Saloni
09/05/23, 15:49 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: Here is my weekend activity
09/05/23, 15:58 - Saloni Rastogi: It's great to see that you have a good understanding of decision-making and the importance of making both good and bad decisions. Your personal experience of pursuing your dream in the medical and health industry despite facing negative opinions is inspiring. It's crucial to seek guidance from successful individuals and learn from the mistakes of others. Avoiding bad decisions, such as choosing the wrong company, is also crucial for personal growth. Remember that taking responsibility for bad decisions, correcting them, and learning from them is essential. Considering factors like personality, culture, available information, and education can contribute to making better decisions. Keep up the thoughtful approach to decision-making in your life.
09/05/23, 15:58 - Saloni Rastogi: For the schools number that I last shared, I can understand that the schools might not be on whatsapp but did you try calling them?

09/03/23, 21:38 - Saloni Rastogi: The students who did not follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian on the EWYL Line yesterday, did not receive the Wednesday lesson this time.
I hope you now understand that being consistent in your efforts is very necessary and not everyone knows how to do that but I am sure you will continuously remind yourself and set up your timetable accordingly, for the sessions as well as the daily ritual.

09/03/23, 23:04 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: In summary the Wednesday Wisdom writes about NSM which is a key performance indicator representing a major goal in a business.The NSM helps see the aim of a business and also measure it's successes.
An example of Facebook is given.Facebook's NSM is \"Daily active users \" which aims on increasing Facebook 's daily users and generating revenue from them through advertisements.
Another example is Airbnb .Its NSM  is \"Nights booked\".As much more nights are booked from  Airbnb , it also means more revenue they get and the more they achieve their aim of user satisfaction.
For students the learing NSM could be \" learning mastery \". This measures a student's potential on a particular subject This can be assessed through exams, projects and quizzes. The student 's learning mastery NSM helps them reach their goals and achieve academic success.This can also be improved by consistent studying and regular academic interaction with their teachers and peers to help improve on their weaknesses.The NSM also helps students to stay motivated
09/03/23, 23:20 - Saloni Rastogi: When setting direction to success you must make good choices on the path you are going to choose. 
Setting goals is the most important thing you can do in your life.
For us, the North Star Metric is achieving the target of 15 forms at least a week and earning about $50 in a month.
09/03/23, 23:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Af for the community building project,  now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
09/03/23, 23:21 - Saloni Rastogi: A] Through WhatsApp community groups:


STEP 1: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME\/MENTOR NAME\/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED
For eg: in your case it will be Fanuel\/Saloni\/9MAR2023
09/03/23, 23:22 - Saloni Rastogi: STEP 2: We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

As for attracting the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 5, and Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
09/03/23, 23:22 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: Ok l note that, thank you
09/03/23, 23:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to STUDY IN INDIA with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
09/03/23, 23:22 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: Ok
09/03/23, 23:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

And in a very similar manner, you can repeat the same process with the Form 5 students as well.
09/03/23, 23:26 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: Ok
10/03/23, 00:35 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's have the discussion on Saturday, till then please keep working on the PROJECTS!
10/03/23, 02:38 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: I am following well

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

13/03/23, 21:25 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: **North star metric* 
A North Metric Star is the one metric that captures the core value that your product delivers to customers.For example , your north star order value ( AOV ) and customer retention rate if you sell a meal delivery service.
A North star metric is a business guide.It works like a compass pointing the business in the right direction and keeping you focused on your primary goal of company growth and success based on what makes your customers happiest and keeps them coming back for more.The metric gives everyone at the company something to rally behind and also help if a business is becoming successful.
My  north star metric as a student is personal mission statement ( PMS).I depend on my life as the world changes around you.l belive my major aim is growing everyday in terms of personality and also academically.The metric helps me put more focus on the things that improve myself and grow bigger in the community and one day even in the world and build on my lifetime dream of one day owning a laboratory that helps students in science and technology and mostly in the study of fungi

13/03/23, 21:25 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: That's great
13/03/23, 22:02 - Saloni Rastogi: I am so happy to hear what you think about the _North Star metric, I am sure that we will be able to apply the same __motivation, enthusiasm, and zeal_ towards our *EWYL Program* and the *PROJECTS*. And channel all our energy into the right direction, that is in the _completion of our weekly target of getting *15 Community Building Forms* ._
13/03/23, 22:03 - Saloni Rastogi: I see Fanuel you have still not added me in the group. Are you facing any challenges?
13/03/23, 22:05 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: Thank you
13/03/23, 22:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Fanuel, may I know why are there just two participants in the group?
13/03/23, 22:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me reiterate what kind of participants can be added and how you can do that.
13/03/23, 22:07 - Saloni Rastogi: The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

As for attracting the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 5, and Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
13/03/23, 22:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to STUDY IN INDIA with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
13/03/23, 22:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

And in a very similar manner, you can repeat the same process with the Form 5 students as well.
13/03/23, 22:08 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: I just did.The only problem l am  only facing is that most people who wrote their exams last year have already secured their university places .So l am still yet to find the right students who are in form 6 and form 5 now
13/03/23, 22:13 - Fanuel EWYL22E0893: I am working on increasing the participants
13/03/23, 22:20 - Saloni Rastogi: Have you reached out to everyone in your school?
13/03/23, 22:20 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you a part of all form 5 and form 6's unofficial class groups?
