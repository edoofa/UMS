05/06/23, 17:36 - Ananya:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, Let me share a small story with you!
 Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came. 
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.
The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell: 

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. 
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above  
05/06/23, 17:37 - Ananya: Greetings, dear! How are you?

The passage highlights the steps we can take to cultivate a great results.
Seek support, we need to create an environment which is favourable to our goals which are friends and teachers
Set realistic goals, we must plan how we are going to tickle the task buy setting short goal inline with the project so accomplishments motivate our self towards the main agenda.
Learn from mistakes, the setbacks must give us an experience to handle the next adjective
Develop resilience, the failure must give us the power to try again
Focus on the solution, in everything happens in the way we must keep focused on the main goal

I'm sharing this information with my students early because these external projects will be considered as valuable experience when they pursue their future dream jobs!
These projects will only be offered to students who have excelled in the EWYL journey and previous projects, as they demonstrate dedication and consistency. So, I think it's essential for us to start preparing as soon as possible. Together, we will brainstorm creative ways to maintain our positive reputation and excellent record. What are your thoughts on this?

Therefore, I want you to be proactive and consistent with your EWYL projects so that you can uphold your reputation in the EWYL department. This way, when an external project comes up, your name will immediately come to mind as a top candidate. Keep up the hard work, and you'll create more opportunities for yourself in the future!
10/08/23, 14:21 - Bright EWYL22E0899: Oh thank you Mem I will try my best. I'm ready for any  task at any time Mem
