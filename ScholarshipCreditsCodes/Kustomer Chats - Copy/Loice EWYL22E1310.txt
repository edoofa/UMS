20/03/23, 17:42 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my proud Edoofian!

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!","transform":"

20/03/23, 18:03 - Aditi Kapoor: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

20/03/23, 22:31 - Loice EWYL22E1310: I didn't understood clearly what should I create exactly
20/03/23, 22:35 - Aditi Kapoor: So you should write down some points in a document where you should write about your values and long-term goals
20/03/23, 22:53 - Loice EWYL22E1310: Okay thank you Sir
20/03/23, 23:03 - Aditi Kapoor: So have you written it down Loice?
20/03/23, 23:45 - Loice EWYL22E1310: From what i learnt and understood from the Wednesday Wisdom

Wealth are riches, valuable material or possessions.

Money is a currency mantainance by estate or other entity which can guarantee its value, it may be hard cash, banknotes and coins.

Status is a person's condition, position or high standing or legal condition of a person.

From the the document, i understand that it is best to seek wealth not money or status, because wealth is a long life legacy it produce capital if you invest and manage properly the key to building wealth is to focus on creating assets that generate passive income.

Where as money is also important as it is the tool to help you achieve your financial goals. Seeking money is not more reliable than seeking wealth because money can be affected by the flactuating rates and lose value while wealth is long life legacy and it produces income.

Status is the place of social hierarchy and it is often associated with wealth and money because money and wealth give a person a higher and respected status.

To my fully understanding, seeking wealth not money and status is much reliable because the wealth generate income profit for financial stability to you and your family.

For the the values there are monetary values where you educated the community about them
And for the long term goals i would acquire a financial job, develop a career plan and invest into wealth and also improve communication skills.
21/03/23, 00:16 - Aditi Kapoor: Wow Loice! I am more than impressed by your understanding!
21/03/23, 00:19 - Loice EWYL22E1310: Thank you Sir
21/03/23, 00:20 - Aditi Kapoor: Thank you for your understanding and thoughtful response. You have accurately summarized the distinctions between wealth, money, and status and have recognized the benefits of seeking wealth over money or status alone.

It is important to note that while money can be a useful tool for achieving financial goals, it is not always a reliable indicator of long-term financial success. As you mentioned, the value of money can fluctuate, and it is important to focus on building assets that can generate passive income and contribute to long-term financial stability.

Additionally, your emphasis on educating the community about monetary values is commendable, as financial literacy is an important skill for individuals to develop in order to make informed decisions about their financial well-being.

Finally, your suggestion to acquire a financial job, develop a career plan, and invest in wealth while improving communication skills is an excellent strategy for achieving long-term financial success. By developing a solid understanding of finance, building a career plan, and investing in assets that generate passive income, individuals can build long-term wealth and achieve financial stability for themselves and their families.

22/03/23, 22:56 - Aditi Kapoor: The concept of wealth has been a topic of much debate and discussion for centuries. While some view wealth as a means to achieve success and fulfillment, others may view it with suspicion or even disdain. However, it is important to understand that ethical wealth creation is possible and can be a force for good in the world. In this regard, it is essential to examine our own perspectives on wealth creation, and consider how they may impact our relationship with money, status, and success.","transform":"

23/03/23, 21:14 - Loice EWYL22E1310: Understanding that Ethical Wealth Creation is possible. If you secretly Despise wealth. It will Elude you.

Ethical wealth creation remarks on a worthy approach and a good wealth is a antidote to poverty and allow for self reliance. Three laws to successful wealth creation are : spend less than you earn, invest your surplus wisely and leave it alone so it can grow.

From the provided information in my own understanding : many people believe that wealth is something to be despised and avoided while others sees it as a path to success and fulfillment. It can be ethical wealth or unethical depending on how it is acquired and used.

Wealth is like a tool and like any tool it can be used for good and for ill.

Ethical wealth creation involves creating values for others in a way that is both sustainable and fair. Ethical wealth creation should create value creation for the community and the fostering of a legacy acceptable to all.

Unethically wealth creation involves fraud, exploitation or environment degradation and it involves people who are greedy and selfish who do for their own benefits.

For people who despise wealth do so because they believe that where one person's gain necessarily comes another person's loss and they result in failing to attain any achievement or something desired.

To sum up, wealth creation is building wealth through a variety or methods using financial products. Wealth can be created by earned income or passive income. However wealth can be created ethically or unethically and people tend to despise wealth are also people who manipulate wealth by involving unethically practices. By following the ethical wealth creation it leads to a successful path and fulfillment of desires.
