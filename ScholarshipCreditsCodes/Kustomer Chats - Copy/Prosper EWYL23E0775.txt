18/11/23, 13:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Mr Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
18/11/23, 14:23 - Prosper EWYL23E0775: Ok ma'am
18/11/23, 20:20 - Prosper EWYL23E0775: I faced a dire situation when forced to choose between two passionate things i wanted. I was excelling great in basketball, chess and my education but there was a bit of a mix up in my timetable so i had to choose between my extra curricular activities

My teachers suggested that i had to focus on my school work and leave the sporting nad club activities but i took an altanative route rather than going with what everyone said. I dropped some subjects and narrowed my focus on the combination which i wanted to persure in my future and took on my extra curricular activities which helped me to reduce stress and blow off steam when i was pressurised.
20/11/23, 16:22 - Prosper EWYL23E0775: I am a proud edoofian

20/11/23, 16:47 - Saloni Rastogi: I appreciate your resilience and proactive approach in handling such a challenging situation. It takes courage to take an alternative route, especially when faced with conflicting advice. Your decision to prioritize both your academic pursuits and extracurricular activities, despite the mix-up in your timetable, showcases your dedication and commitment to personal growth.
Dropping some subjects to narrow your focus and pursue your passion not only reflects strategic thinking but also a keen understanding of what brings you fulfillment and stress relief. Balancing academics and extracurriculars is a commendable feat, and your ability to make decisions that align with your long-term goals is truly inspiring.
Keep embracing challenges with this level of determination, and I'm confident that your unique approach will continue to contribute to your success and personal development.
20/11/23, 18:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's reconvene on Wednesday for another dose of wisdom and inspiration during our Wednesday Wisdom session. I look forward to our continued learning and growth together. Until then, take care, and have a great day!

30/11/23, 16:33 - Prosper EWYL23E0775: Afternoon maam
30/11/23, 16:33 - Prosper EWYL23E0775: Sorry i had some network troubles
30/11/23, 16:34 - Prosper EWYL23E0775: Yes i have
30/11/23, 16:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share your response to the Wednesday lesson?
01/12/23, 19:58 - Prosper EWYL23E0775: The skill of analysis helps a student understand the world around him or her better and helps one to get a deeper understanding of the tasks at hand. One has to understand the task and consider his or her inputs. Inputs are the basic, primary block which serve as a raw material in form of data, skills or information given one to finish a task through understanding the crafting process with the materials given thus all this is to present a finished product or the output. 

One has to go through the crafting process and evaluate the outputs, if there are mistakes one has to learn from them in order to produce a higher quality of output the next time one attempts the same task

"Education is the key to emancipation" this qoute through analysing it shows that the skills learnt are not limited to the classroom only but also apply in the real world for instances in business and day to day activities where one has to take upon the next best alternative choice in cases of hardships.
02/12/23, 17:45 - Saloni Rastogi: _*Hello, my Proud Edoofian*_!

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

Best Regards
TEAM EWYL!
02/12/23, 17:46 - Saloni Rastogi: I wanted to express my appreciation for your thoughtful reflection on the importance of analysis in education. Your understanding of how analysis contributes to a deeper comprehension of the world and tasks is commendable. Recognizing inputs as the foundational blocks and raw materials for crafting solutions reflects a keen awareness of the problem-solving process.
02/12/23, 19:36 - Prosper EWYL23E0775: Ok ma'am
03/12/23, 16:17 - Prosper EWYL23E0775: In one situation i once was involved myself into my uncles wholesale shop and the shop was not doing so well despite being a large wholesale company. What we had as inputs were the commodities which he sold in his shop and after a thorough research and analysis i found out that his wholesale targeted the large businesses companies which bought in large bulk hence it had a limited sphere and i suggested that we breakdown the bulk and reduce its cost and by doing this we earn little but large amounts of profits as our business will have a large sphere of influence as it will attract the small scale wholesalers, retailers and large companies rather than wanting high amounts of profits which come after maybe 10 sales per fortnight. As a result of my strategy, profits doubled and sales shot up.
In this scenario i learnt that one should not limit himself to one set of people or ideas, rather one should try to invole himself or herself in every sphere and learn what they can from them in order to make progress
04/12/23, 12:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Good morning Prosper!
How are you?

This week we will be having our session on Monday and Thursday from 12:00 - 01:30 PM on the EWYL Line.

In our session for today, we will be discussing:
1. Saturday Activity
2. Project updates 
       (I hope you remember our weekly targets: Either you have to share 5 forms for Community Building projects per week OR _1 form for African School Reform project per week)
3. Newsletter of the week

This all will be done on the EWYL Line, please make sure you follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' every morning.
04/12/23, 12:25 - Saloni Rastogi: We will discuss everything in our session, I am very excited!
04/12/23, 12:27 - Prosper EWYL23E0775: The project update part i didn't grasp the point well ma'am can u shade some light on it
04/12/23, 12:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Sure, I mean we will be analysing what progress you made on projects last week, we will discuss ways to polish our performance, and then plan to action for the same.
04/12/23, 12:43 - Prosper EWYL23E0775: Ok understood now
04/12/23, 15:47 - Saloni Rastogi: So Prosper, can you please share your response on the Saturday activity?
04/12/23, 16:18 - Prosper EWYL23E0775: In one situation i once was involved myself into my uncles wholesale shop and the shop was not doing so well despite being a large wholesale company.

04/12/23, 16:30 - Saloni Rastogi: I appreciate you sharing this with me, but I would appreciate that as a part of the Saturday activity, we kindly request you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects.
04/12/23, 17:41 - Prosper EWYL23E0775: Ohh i thought you wanted an outside the classroom activity
04/12/23, 17:43 - Prosper EWYL23E0775: So does the process of  reaching out to other students and evaluating the inputs and outputs suffice?
04/12/23, 19:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, you were supposed to share what inputs you believe you have done so far and its associated challenges.
04/12/23, 19:31 - Prosper EWYL23E0775: Ok ma'am will share then
05/12/23, 10:06 - Prosper EWYL23E0775: On my EWYL projects i had been tasked to get ahold of other students like me who would like a chance to study abroad. I used ICT tools and the information on procedures provided by edoofa which included creating whatsapp groups, researching on LinkedIn and other platforms. I faced some challenges like scammers and other fake websites which delayed my work but there are other websites which did not scam.
