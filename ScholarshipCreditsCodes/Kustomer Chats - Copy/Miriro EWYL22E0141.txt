20/07/22, 23:42 - Miriro EWYL22E0141: The Fastest growing industry in Zimbabwe is agriculture
From my researchers Zimbabwe is now growing faster in the industry of agriculture due to an increase in the annual rainfall.
From 2020 to 2021 Zimbabwe received a lot of rain that it was able to store millions of tonnes in the grain marketing boards.
The most product which was stored is maize.And also a lot of tobacco was harvested . Tobacco is the product which mainly bring foreign currency in Zimbabwe as few countries grow it.This is another factor that leads agriculture industry to grow.
The was a new system of farming which was introduced in 2019 and I'm quite sure that it is also the major factor that contributed to the rise of agriculture industry.
On my predictions on this industry I can see that it is going to keep on increasing because the country is importing a lot of resources to be used during the captivating period.Also the country is fighting to provide each household with seeds and fertilizers.

Well I found that story very interesting and helpful .I can say it has helped me a lot to be one who depend on herself comes what.One who doesn't have to always blame others on her mistakes .When I looked over this story it taught me to be someone who always stay positive, someone who doesn't look down on herself, someone who is intelligent who challenge problems all the time.
It was stated clearly in the story that successful people don't blame someone when something goes wrong ,I can also relate this to intelligent people In school when they fail a certain question they admit and look for solution but those not intelligent will be blaming the teacher or something else.im really glad to be part of edoofa as it teaches me many things and also motivate me  .

27/07/22, 19:19 - Miriro EWYL22E0141: Yes sir let me send it
27/07/22, 19:32 - Miriro EWYL22E0141: Greetings to you it's Miriro your proud edoofian. Im glad to share with you my opinion on the growth mindset of successful people.
Successful people are different people from those who are not successful by a great difference.

Successful people are people who are observant on many things,they are people who see things differently.When problems arise in their business ,they are not people who always blame others  instead they look for the cause of the problem and solve it.Successfull people are mostly the ones who works hard than unsuccessful people, people who can not sleep.
In order to acquire these skills of successful people ,a great practice of their deeds is needed like as of me ,in whatever problem that arise at school or at home ,I always need to take that blame on me and then find the solution to it.
To become a successful person in life ,I need to be one who is hardworking.I also need to be one who is competitive as I see this act makes people acquire great things in life.
