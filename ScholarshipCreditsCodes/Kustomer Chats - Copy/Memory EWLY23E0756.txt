4) In the group just:
-please give 'only admins' access
-just ask the students/participants to DM you to know about Edoofa and to get the form
-once they DM you, share about Edoofa with them
-Before sharing the form, ask them to get you added to their school groups
-once they do that, then only share the form with them.‚Äã

She has actually joined their WhatsApp class groups and is now communicating with them. Not only that, since she is connected with students from various schools, she is also obtaining the contact information of school administrators.

Don't you think it is an amazing idea?

Will Artificial Intelligence revolutionize our world or render us obsolete?

 As we witness the remarkable progress in AI, we ponder its potential to transform our lives and simultaneously question if it will replace us
15/11/23, 15:32 - Memory EWLY23E0756: I will send my picture celebrating Diwali
15/11/23, 15:33 - Ananya: Good morning, Memory!

How are you? How was your Diwali? I'm excited to share that many of my students in Africa celebrated Diwali by lighting candles and writing special wishes. Did you do that candle activity as well?
15/11/23, 15:34 - Memory EWLY23E0756: Yes i did will send you my picture as soon as i get home how was yours
15/11/23, 15:35 - Ananya: Lovely! You know, we celebrated Diwali in our office as well. From decorating our office to playing some games, we had a great time!
15/11/23, 15:42 - Memory EWLY23E0756: Wow that's amazing I'm sure u enjoyed
15/11/23, 15:48 - Ananya: So, as per our last conversation, we were discussing joining the other students' official groups for your community-building project. May I ask if you were able to do that?
15/11/23, 15:54 - Memory EWLY23E0756: Yes i formed anothwr group that is mainly catering for students that are still doing their A level at my friend's school
15/11/23, 15:57 - Ananya: That's great. Now, You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information.
15/11/23, 15:59 - Memory EWLY23E0756: Noted will surely do so
15/11/23, 16:00 - Ananya: For this, I want you to frame a few questions that you can ask the students to check their eligibility."
15/11/23, 16:02 - Memory EWLY23E0756: Can you please help me out with a few questions that i might ask them
15/11/23, 16:04 - Ananya: I will help you with that. However, I want to understand from you, what kind of confusion a student generally has in their mind while moving forward with the scholarship application.
15/11/23, 16:06 - Memory EWLY23E0756: The scholarship percentage
15/11/23, 16:17 - Ananya: Alright, so do you inform your students about the scholarship percentage?
15/11/23, 16:18 - Memory EWLY23E0756: I'm also not sure about that percentage but i think it's inline with the university you will attend
15/11/23, 16:24 - Ananya: Well, Memory, under the Edoofa scholarship program, a student can receive a 50-100% scholarship depending on their results, extracurricular activities, and other eligibility criteria.
15/11/23, 16:27 - Memory EWLY23E0756: Ooooh okay thanks for letting me know
07/12/23, 13:02 - Memory EWLY23E0756: I am a proud Edoofian

07/12/23, 13:31 - Ananya: So, why have you switched to a new number?
07/12/23, 13:33 - Memory EWLY23E0756: I have been facing challenges with my old phone so it went for repair but as soon as it is repaired I will go back to using it
07/12/23, 13:38 - Ananya: Alright, so Memory may I aks if you were able to connect with your school head?

07/12/23, 13:51 - Memory EWLY23E0756: Ooh okay then
07/12/23, 14:00 - Ananya: Memory, you know I am currently mentoring 389 students, and based on my experience, I can confidently say that you have the potential to achieve great heights! With a little more effort, you can easily finance your education and support your parents.

As your mentor, I genuinely believe in your abilities, and I am eager to help you become one of our star students. I am willing to put in extra effort for your progress. Please let me know if you wish to proceed in that direction.
07/12/23, 14:01 - Memory EWLY23E0756: I truly wish to proceed in that direction
07/12/23, 14:06 - Ananya: That's great! Before setting any target for you this week or guiding you in any random direction, I want to help you improve the way you are working. Can you share your approach to working on the projects?
07/12/23, 14:15 - Memory EWLY23E0756: I favour using physical approach with people
07/12/23, 14:16 - Ananya: Alright, so how frequently do you connect with the students? Do you follow up with them, and how do you assess their progress?
07/12/23, 14:18 - Memory EWLY23E0756: I mostly connect with them during the weekends since they will be busy during the week days with their school work
07/12/23, 14:21 - Ananya: Alright, for this week, I want you to adjust your strategy a bit. Try connecting with them for around 30 minutes at night when the students are more active. Now, tell me, how are you searching for the students?
07/12/23, 14:23 - Memory EWLY23E0756: Right now I am targeting students from my church
07/12/23, 14:25 - Ananya: Alright, that's great. This time, in addition to these tasks, start connecting with your school juniors. Share your personal experience with them, from counseling sessions to your EWYL sessions.
07/12/23, 14:26 - Memory EWLY23E0756: Noted Ma'am
07/12/23, 14:29 - Ananya: Great, so for for your next 10 days, your target is to connect with 12 students and one school head. Is that alright?
07/12/23, 14:30 - Memory EWLY23E0756: Yes it is
07/12/23, 14:33 - Ananya: Now, As we conclude our session, I'd like to leave you with this empowering thought:

09/12/23, 17:51 - Ananya: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!
