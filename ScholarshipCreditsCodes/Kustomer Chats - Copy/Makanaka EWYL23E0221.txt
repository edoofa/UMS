Express your curiousity in the comments!
20/06/23, 15:31 - Makanaka EWYL23E0221: I researched all four entrepreneurs and the one who caught my attention more is 
*Divine Ndhlukula* 
Divine is a business woman and is the founder and managing director of DDNS security operations like me she had great interest in the world of business Divine studied for an executive masters in business Administration (MBA) which is interesting because because very soon I'll be doing Batchelors degree in business Administration (BBA)  we have another thing in common and this motivates me Divine is a risk taker as she took the chance to revolutionize the male dominanted security sector. For past years Divine has held alot of high and professional positions . My father always told me to never forgot where I come from no matter and I guess Divine also knows that too because in November 2022 she launched Mbuya Mary library in a home area which benefits 8 catchment schools where she also pays school fees for disadvantaged children Divine says her father always believed that both girls and boys had equal opportunities that's the difference between me and her 
My father is old school he actually believed that a girl child should grow up to get married that's it but reading about Divine has taught that that's not the case another thing I have learnt is that it's support from our friends and family that keeps us going 
The world of business requires hardwork and determination
20/06/23, 15:32 - Makanaka EWYL23E0221: Here is the feedback on the weekend activity

22/06/23, 16:08 - Makanaka EWYL23E0221: My understanding is that Ellen Johnson proved that one should not let small life challenges discourage you or put you down this teaches us to embrace difficulties as opportunities to grow and yes true leadership requires the courage to make difficult decisions I have come to understand another great leadership quality from her 
I got to undertand that honesty and intergrity are also essential qualities as a leader it true that one must value honesty to inded cultural fairness some of us grew up in communities where they believe  women are only good at house chores and taking care of kids and that women are weak but Ellen teaches us to challenge gender stereotypes and advocate for equal opportunities and celebrate diversity 
I learned to value education as it is indeed the key to success and don't let your gender or background affect your ability to effect change 
Ellen Johnson is a good role model
22/06/23, 16:12 - Ananya: I completely agree! Ellen Johnson's life journey demonstrates the importance of not allowing small challenges to discourage or diminish one's spirit.
