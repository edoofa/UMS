Best wishes for the new day!
Team edoofa has arranged a webinar  for you all, 
The webinar would be taken by Ronard Kachage.
Designation  founder at Success Magazine.

Date  August 
Time  IST 

Takeaways from the webinar.
The topic will be along the lines of how Mr. Kachaje went on to pursue a career in real estate by having a degree in the same field and eventually figured out his calling which was building the media brand  Magazine. One of the many benefits of starting a business or pursuing your passions when one is a bit older is that they bring all of the experience and wisdom to the table. 
The journey of Mr. Kachaje is certainly inspiring, growth-oriented, and a wonderful example for the youth of today, not only in terms of being passionate about what you believe in but also having a consistent outlook towards learning on the way and figuring things out at the same time. 

Please fill the RSVP form  the RSVP Form: https:\/\/forms.gle\/NnZ5v4tj2tbkroKQ8

12/07/22, 20:09 - Kelvin EWYL22E0047: Good morning, my interesting Mentor⭐
How are you today?

So in response to the Saturday Activity, I would like to highlight some of the skills that an individual like I, your mentee should possess or uphold so that one can be given a chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits.
So first of all, it's all about the Mindset.
A mindset that sets up goals that need to be achieved, A mindset that works towards achieving the same goals, A mindset that doesn't believe in Failure, A mindset that persists in every situation...It's all about the Mindset.

So we can therefore also realize that all other character qualities for example; positive attitude, Hardworking, persistence, Inquisitiveness and many others will be byproducts of the Mindset's Status!

So the Skill that I should uphold here is having a properly set and trained Mindset that will always be fruitful and encourage excellent skills Growth!?
12/07/22, 20:52 - Unknown: Kelvin, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.
This way you will always be recognized by the Academics Board for new projects.
12/07/22, 21:09 - Kelvin EWYL22E0047: Yes sure Sir
I doing quite well⭐

While going through our conversation, I noticed that you haven't submitted *Wednesday's Lesson* yet.
The deadline to make the submission is *Thursday* *6 PM*. Please make sure that you submit your response before that because the *Academic Board* keeps a very strict check on these things. 
 
The aim of this activity is to make you aware of the life journey of Patrice Motsepe and how you can inculcate his traits in your daily life.
