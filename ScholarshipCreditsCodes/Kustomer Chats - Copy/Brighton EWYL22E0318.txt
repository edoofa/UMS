It comprises of a list of activities that need to be done in a day and it gives a highlight of your daily activities.One needs to find that time during the day when they are focused and active so that they can execute their tasks during that that time.Creating a network is also vital as you would be able to help people with their dreams and goals they inturn feel motivated to assist you achieve yours.

Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!

16/07/22, 06:11 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

18/07/22, 16:25 - Brighton EWYL22E0318: the fast growing industry or business in Zimbabwe is the fruits and vegetable field.The fruits and vegetables market is expected to register a CAGR of 2.5% during a period of 2022 -2027.The industry was negatively affected by covid19 pandemic as the lockdown restricted farmers from transportation of goods leading to high spoilage of the produce.However during the pandemic the goverment realised the spoils and managed  to help farmers with trucks and building rooms which would help keep the produce fresh.this industry is always flactuating this is because of the inflations occuring in the country and changes in prices however the government decided to support the farmers and has been offering them seeds at affordable prices .The famers have very little exposure on the international market but through the gvernment's initiatives for adherence to phytosanitary conditions the export makert is boming for the produce.The demand for processed goods like juices and edible oils increased during the study period.In 2020 the fruits topped the Zimbabwe market production and accounting .Ever since 2017 there has been a steady increase in the production showing thee demand within the country and also outside countries like South Africa with 62% of imprts of fruits from Zim in 2017 and Vietman.there was a slight decline in 2020 due to the pandemic .Overally the vegetable market is dominant in Zimbabwe with  Matebeleland South being the main region for production

Happy New Week, my proud Edoofian! How was your weekend?
18/07/22, 19:19 - Unknown: Brighton, Amazing to read your response for the weekend activity. I like how you chose this particular industry and how you have explained about it's growth in the time to come. Keep it up.
18/07/22, 19:19 - Unknown: Did you also work on the SWOT analysis as asked by Ms Davi?
18/07/22, 19:33 - Brighton EWYL22E0318: Thank you sir
18/07/22, 19:34 - Brighton EWYL22E0318: I tried to in the essay
18/07/22, 20:03 - Unknown: I see Brighton!
18/07/22, 20:04 - Unknown: Let me first help you understand what SWOT Analysis is.

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment.This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organisations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
18/07/22, 22:22 - Brighton EWYL22E0318: OK thank you sir
18/07/22, 22:41 - Brighton EWYL22E0318: So can i do that
18/07/22, 23:11 - Unknown: As seen above, SWOT is an acronym of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. However, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym:

1 Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
2 Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
3 Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
4 Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by
18/07/22, 23:12 - Brighton EWYL22E0318: Thank you sir
18/07/22, 23:15 - Unknown: You know Brighton, why SWOT Analysis is important? It can help you to challenge risky assumptions and to uncover dangerous blindspots about your organization's performance. If you use it carefully and collaboratively, it can deliver new insights on where your business currently is, and help you to develop exactly the right strategy for any situation.

For example, you may be well aware of some of your organization's strengths, but until you record them alongside weaknesses and threats you might not realize how unreliable those strengths actually are.

Equally, you likely have reasonable concerns about some of your business weaknesses but, by going through the analysis systematically, you could find an opportunity, previously overlooked, that could more than compensate.
18/07/22, 23:21 - Brighton EWYL22E0318: That's very enlightening
19/07/22, 00:00 - Unknown: Now, What Are the Biggest SWOT Analysis Mistakes?
19/07/22, 00:08 - Brighton EWYL22E0318: One can overestimate the strength
19/07/22, 00:30 - Unknown: Yes Brighton.
19/07/22, 00:31 - Unknown: Here are some of the mistake I believe we make.
19/07/22, 00:31 - Unknown: 1 Making your lists too long. Ask yourself if your ideas are feasible as you go along.
2 Being vague. Be specific to provide more focus for later discussions.
3. Not seeing weaknesses. Be sure to ask customers and colleagues what they experience in real life.
4. Not thinking ahead. It's easy to come up with nice ideas without taking them through to their logical conclusion. Always consider their practical impact.
5 Being unrealistic. Don't plan in detail for opportunities that don't exist yet.
19/07/22, 00:53 - Brighton EWYL22E0318: OK thank you
19/07/22, 01:05 - Unknown: Brighton, Here is a video that teaches you how you can implement SWOT Analysis in your work, business and career.
