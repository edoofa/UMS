06/06/23, 16:16 - Ananya: Great! How are you Emelia?
06/06/23, 16:17 - Emelia EWYL22E1237: I'm good, how are you Ms Ananya
06/06/23, 16:20 - Ananya: So, may I ask if you were able to attend the video session?

06/06/23, 16:24 - Ananya: Alright, so Today we're going to talk about how to find student-centric SMEs in Africa using Google and LinkedIn. Are you familiar with these tools?
06/06/23, 16:24 - Emelia EWYL22E1237: Google and LinkedIn yess
06/06/23, 16:33 - Ananya: Great,Let's start with Google. When you're searching for student-centric SMEs in Africa, what keywords do you think you should use?
06/06/23, 16:36 - Emelia EWYL22E1237: Small scale educational companies in Africa
06/06/23, 16:36 - Ananya: That's a good start. You could also try "student-centered SMEs in Africa" or "African startups focused on education". Once you have a list of relevant startups, the next step is to find the company officials on LinkedIn. Have you used LinkedIn before?
06/06/23, 16:40 - Emelia EWYL22E1237: No I haven't use it before but I have opened a LinkedIn account already
06/06/23, 16:42 - Ananya: That's okay. LinkedIn is a professional networking platform where you can connect with people in your industry. First, you'll need to create a profile if you haven't already. Then, you can search for the company you're interested in by typing the name of the company into the search bar.
06/06/23, 16:50 - Emelia EWYL22E1237: Okay
06/06/23, 16:50 - Emelia EWYL22E1237: Noted

How did you get in touch with the contact person?
06/06/23, 17:01 - Ananya: And To find the name, description, and website of a company, you can simply use Google search. It will provide you with the relevant information you need. As for the contact person's name and LinkedIn ID, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to LinkedIn and search for the company name.
2. You will see multiple LinkedIn accounts associated with the company.
3. Look for someone who is related to marketing within the company.

13/06/23, 15:49 - Emelia EWYL22E1237: Pardon me ,which activity Ma'am
13/06/23, 15:51 - Ananya: This: Greetings,

Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week’s Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better—together. It’s why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger—as successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself. 

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon. 
Till then Happy Learning!

13/06/23, 16:39 - Emelia EWYL22E1237: Okay ma'am, thank you
13/06/23, 16:40 - Ananya: Now, Emelia! I was just talking with a few of my students about productivity and seriousness in your day-to-day life, and a few of them told me that there has been a lack in their performance and they want to fix this with me. So, I was thinking to ask each of my students about their weaknesses and together we shall try to overcome that. See I believe it is quite impossible to be perfect, and we don't even have to  be perfect. However in order to progress in life and standing out of a croud we should always try to become a better version. So I want to ask if you have ever come across a time when you feel that this is my weak point and I want to fix that.
13/06/23, 16:43 - Emelia EWYL22E1237: Yeah that's true
13/06/23, 16:44 - Emelia EWYL22E1237: There is a time I feel like something needs to be fixed as well
13/06/23, 16:48 - Ananya: So do you have a weak point?
