01/11/22, 00:37 - Lerato EWYL22E0049: Noted ma'am
01/11/22, 00:42 - Unknown: Let me share this weekend's activity with you.
01/11/22, 00:42 - Unknown: Today, I want my Edoofians to say aloud what they are, what they represent, and how they feel about it. 
I want all my students to express how they feel being connected with EDOOFA, their individual experience with the Team, and how they can inspire thousands of students out there to aspire and dream BIG.

I want that for their weekend activity, all my students to write reviews on GOOGLE and FACEBOOK.
1) I am sharing a training manual with you. In it, I have stated step by step to write a Google as well as Facebook review.

2) Sample reviews:
- 'It has been a great experience with Edoofa, we love it and want everyone to trust them'
- 'Edoofa has been the biggest ladder towards fulfilling my aspirations

3) Once you are done with writing the Google and Facebook review, share screenshots with me.
Screenshot 1  Google review
Screenshot 2  Facebook review

This can be an amazing way you can express your gratitude and be known to all those thousands of students who are planning BIG.

Hope you learn through this activity!

Happy weekend?

How are you?

Someone, who never gives up, or quits on the dream they see and really want to fulfill, no matter what. Moving through scorching heat, drenching rains, and heavy snow, they reach their destination and complete their journey. In this lesson, you will also learn, what happens when an entire community inherits this trait and keeps working on it. How recognition is earned and respect is gained through time, patience, and endless efforts.

So, in our session on the EWYL Line, we will discuss:
1) your views on the Wednesday lesson
03/11/22, 21:58 - Unknown: In case you have any pending responses left, please share them by today itself.
This November, I want that all the opportunities that I have like:
- *Edoofian of the week*
- *Projects other than our three ongoing ones*
- *Webinars*

to go to only those students who are responsible and serious about their sessions.
In case, I had to remind you more than once a week to follow the daily ritual, not only I would be taken aback to share these amazing opportunities with you but also all these interesting and learning lessons and activities will be stopped.
Make sure that from today onwards you follow the daily ritual and share your responses with me timely.
03/11/22, 21:58 - Unknown: Also for the month of *NOVEMBER*, I want that you put your focus on any one project, out of
1) Corporate Alliance\/Company Connect
2) Community Building
3) African School Reform 

Choose any *ONE*, and then we will put all our focus on it.
I want that this NOVEMBER, you earn and aim for LOTS OF SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS.

13/07/22, 00:40 - Unknown: Hello *LERATO*!
How's your day going?
13/07/22, 00:41 - Unknown: First of all I am so happy to see your involvement in our daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud EDOOFIAN'.
13/07/22, 00:42 - Unknown: Secondly, I am very glad to see your response for the community building project.
13/07/22, 00:42 - Unknown: \" A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty\"

- Winston S. Churchill

Through the previous Wednesday lesson, we got an idea that how necessary it is to grab every opportunity and make the best use of it. Also, it is well said that  is a will, there is a way. But to make this opportunity, we must have extremely useful and fruitful skills that can turn into a big game. And telling these skills and practices that are necessary for grabbing skills was the *weekend activity* all about.
I want you to *share your views on the same with me here*.
13/07/22, 00:45 - Unknown: Also Lerato I and Ms. Davi noticed that you have not submitted your response to the last week's Wednesday lesson as well, may I know why?
In case you are facing any challenges, please let me know without any hesitation.

I am so happy to see your excitement each day to sing our daily ritual of 'I am proud edoofian'.
I couldn't be happier and more content seeing this. But Lerato, along with this you need to also buck up with your response.
I have seen you have not shared your past week's Wednesday lesson as well as the weekend activity, may I know why?
I hope everything is fine Lerato.

13/07/22, 22:04 - Unknown: *WEDNESDAY ACTIVITY  we have another dose of Wednesday wisdom on our most loved topic of Entrepreneurship. Yes, today’s lesson is going to talk about a sincere and passionate young female entrepreneur who has made her mark on the African Start up ecosystem. She is an award-winning UI\/UX Designer with seven years of experience working in the technology environment. We are talking about Oluwadamilola Soyombo, the founder of Skooqs. Today’s lesson will take us through the incident when Skooqs was born. I am sure a very valuable lesson is there for all of us to learn from. \u2028\u2028Also, I would like to highlight that Skooqs has partnered with Edoofa and will be working closely on providing our students with projects to work on and gain experience.  The first batch is already assigned the project. \u2028\u2028Go through the audio and pdf carefully and let me know if you have any concerns.
13/07/22, 22:08 - Unknown: *WEEKEND ACTIVITY*
\u2028\u2028You must have learned how critical it is to take advantage of every opportunity. In our Wednesday Wisdom this week, we discussed a profitable business- Skooqs. Do you know that Skooqs was developed in just five days!! Thanks to Oluwadamilola Soyombo's (Founder of Skooqs), diligence and use of the opportunity. The use of the opportunity at the right time with the right skills is currently creating a significant impact on the African entrepreneurial ecosystem.  And well some of you, because of your consistency, diligence, willingness to show up for your sessions, and performance in your weekly activities have gotten this opportunity to work on a project with Skooqs. 

You are probably aware of the possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. This week, I want you to think of a few skills or practices that a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits. 
Please list the skills that are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring in a lot of learning.
13/07/22, 22:11 - Unknown: Please share your response with me by 06:00 PM today Lerato or by the end of the day without fail. I am waiting to discuss your response with you.
13/07/22, 22:45 - Lerato EWYL22E0049: Okay ma'am
14/07/22, 04:29 - Lerato EWYL22E0049: *Wednesday wisdom*

How's your day going?
15/07/22, 01:49 - Unknown: As for your weekend activity response, I am really glad to hear your understanding of the activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY* . They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost up, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.
15/07/22, 01:51 - Unknown: To your Wednesday wisdom, I read your response and I must say that your opinions and views reflect clarity of idea. Not just this, your simplified understanding of our young African entrepreneur, *Oluwadamilola Soyombo* assures me that you have that zeal and passion to turn your dreams and ambitions into a _big successful reality_. 
The main idea behind this is to realize that where there is a DESIRE to work hard, there is always a PATH that can take you to favorable outcomes. I know you are putting in all your efforts and I very well appreciate them, but I know you are capable to do much more than this, it is just about taking one more step ahead of others that will make you outshine in this crowd of millions of people.
This project also highlighted Edoofa's Training and Development partner Skooqs.
15/07/22, 01:52 - Unknown: Now Lerato since you have completed your pending activity and lesson response, I am sharing with you this week's Wednesday wisdom with you. Please go through it and we will discuss your response here, on the EWYL Line in your scheduled session tomorrow.

The fast growing industry in Zimbabwe


One can argue that the Zimbabwean economy is not stable looking at the way things are as they are many opportunities created but are being affected by the turmoil . However there are other sectors which are not greatly affected by this turmoil for example the mining industry.Despite being battered here and there by price and currency concerns gold still represents one of the big growth industries for Zimbabwe.The mineral remains important and the foreign currency earnings grow.

Mining could prove to be big business in Zimbabwe, with mineral exports responsible for 60% of the country’s export earnings as of October 2018, and the mining sector contributing around 16% of national GDP. The government has also outlined ambitious plans to quadruple the sector’s total value to $12bn by 2023 as it looks to take advantage of abundant natural resources such as the country’s Great Dyke, the second-largest platinum deposit in the world with around 2.8 billion tonnes of ore belonging to the platinum group metals.

Despite its mineral wealth, Zimbabwe has historically struggled to turn these resources into profitable enterprises, in no small part due to the country’s occupation by the UK in the mid-20th century. Throughout the post-war period, including its lengthy divorce from the British between the unilateral declaration of independence in 1965 and the election of Robert Mugabe as president in 1980, the influence of overseas, and particularly British, companies in its mineral sector hamstrung the mining industry.

Zimbabwe's plan no doubt aims to take advantage of its huge reserves of platinum metals — the third largest in the world — in a bid to reverse its recent economic woes

Zimbabwe aims to increase the annual revenue of its mining industry from $4bn to more than $12bn over the next four years.

The ambitious goal, laid out in the country’s “Strategic Road to the Achievem

19/07/22, 22:55 - Unknown: I read your response to your weekend activity and it made me so inquisitive to know about the mineral industry I got to know that  predominant minerals mined by the industry include platinum, chrome, gold, coal, and diamonds. The country boasts the second-largest platinum deposit and high-grade chromium ores in the world, with approximately 2.8 billion tons of platinum group metals and 10 billion tons of chromium ore.
Your response is so elaborative and impressive and it provided me with so much knowledge.
19/07/22, 22:56 - Unknown: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader. 
Also Lerato, along with the SWOT analysis of a company, I would appreciate it if you also share a SWOT analysis of yourself. I want to see how much more you have learned beyond this activity.
20/07/22, 16:55 - Unknown: Greetings Lerato!

23/07/22, 00:08 - Unknown: Along with this, let's move on with our session.
Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our WEDNESDAY Wisdom was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
23/07/22, 01:40 - Lerato EWYL22E0049: *Wednesday Wisdom*

Success is something everyone strives to archive.For one to be successful he \/she have to go through certain hardships ,it takes hard work.Being commited to whatever business makes you gain motivation to pursue success.lf the journey to archive something becomes too tedious,it will be more challenging to succeed.

Developing a positive mindset is all about trusting yourself and your ability to succeed. It is important to replace any negative thoughts with positive ones to motivate yourself to keep trying no matter what challenges come your way.
Never blame the next person for your failure.You always have to work hard and focus.
23/07/22, 02:37 - Unknown: I read your response Lerato and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful: hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like, not what others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
23/07/22, 02:40 - Unknown: Now tell me Lerato, how many forms have you got filled till now under the community building project?

24/07/22, 16:52 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

One's mindset is defined as the perception of achieving goals in both the professional and personal lives.One's mind substantially influence the outcomes as it reflects the way an individual views and acts toward life therefore the growth mindset of successful people believe that they learn and improve their basic abilities through effort and failures.They interpret failures and challenges as opportunities to grow and cultivate their existing qualities and talents.People with growth mindset always have a positive view toward hardships.

26/07/22, 22:07 - Unknown: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

Yesterday I had an amazing day. I went to the airport to receive all my proud Edoofians and I had tears in my eyes seeing their happiness and enthusiasm. I want you to look at it and share your thoughts with me.
26/07/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Thank you for sharing those forms with me.
26/07/22, 22:10 - Unknown: I read your understanding of the weekend activity and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it’s not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you’re looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don’t do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.

29/07/22, 06:29 - Unknown: Greetings Lerato!
How's your day going?
29/07/22, 06:30 - Unknown: I see you have typed 3, which means that you want to know more about who a proud edoofian is and what it denotes. Let me help you.
29/07/22, 06:32 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
29/07/22, 06:32 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
