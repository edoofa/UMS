I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
20/11/23, 16:00 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Okay I'm ready!

20/11/23, 16:01 - Ananya: I would suggest early in the morning!
20/11/23, 16:02 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: They were hard. But I'm still hoping for the best.
20/11/23, 16:02 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Alright. I'll do so.
20/11/23, 16:06 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Wow that's very inspiring!
20/11/23, 16:09 - Ananya: Amazing! Now that it's been a while since we last connected and discussed our journey, I would like to focus on our program structure first.
20/11/23, 16:09 - Ananya: Our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
20/11/23, 16:10 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Okay
20/11/23, 16:11 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Understood.
20/11/23, 16:12 - Ananya: Now, I would like you to carefully read the following document once again and share your understanding with me. This way, we can revise our projects and move forward with no confusion.
20/11/23, 16:12 - Ananya: .
20/11/23, 16:12 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Okay ma'am.
20/11/23, 16:20 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Okay. Should I revise the document now or later?
20/11/23, 16:29 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: I've gone through it.
20/11/23, 16:31 - Ananya: Great, I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we donâ€™t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
20/11/23, 16:40 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: The Edoofa program is securing it's Edoofian's future by taking note of how businesses are changing with times to be able to provide Edoofians with good skills. Skills that are aligned with our inspirations and that are emerging. E.g data analysis, creative content writing  and social media literacy, networking, business development e.t.c. Edoofa is doing this to ensure that we are ready for the future.
20/11/23, 16:47 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Project 1

Project 1 is a Cooperate Alliance project. The aim here is for me to understand the market that I'll be working for in the future and start preparing myself for it at an early stage. It states that there are great chances for me to connect with companies that are technologically and digital in nature. The first step for me is to identify the people around me including my family and friends who work in the service sector and tell them about my objectives and my involvement with the Edoofa program mentioning how it's helping me develop the skills required for the my employment in the future after my graduation which is very true. 

I have to create a Linkton account. Linkton is a business platform where I can look for companies as well as employees who are working for those companies to connect with them. Assistance will be provided to me to create the Linkton account. I'll be communicating with different business people through the Linkton platform and make sure to take their contact numbers to set up a meeting with Edoofa. 

I'll have to show the meeting time so that the Edoofian team can talk to the business people about the business aspects that will be created for me once the alliance is finished. 

Connecting with the companies will help me explore my network.  It will gain me leverage and credibility which will help me in my life projects, industrial exposure and even a job in my country.
20/11/23, 16:49 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Project 2

This is a Community building project. I have to approach family and friends willing to study abroad and who have already completed their high school or who have written their exams. 

I have to tell them about my exciting journey and how it has helped me up until now. I will explain the EWYL program and the expenses involved with the program. I'll have to identify people who are good in their academics who look forward to pursue their higher education abroad. 

These people will have to consult with their families first and if the families approve, I'll have to refer them back to Edoofa. Posters and an application form will be sent to me to share with my friends. As an Edoofian I'll have to share at least 10 applications per week.
20/11/23, 16:51 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: I have revised everything.
20/11/23, 16:55 - Ananya: I understand that our session today couldn't be as fruitful as we hoped, mainly due to a technical glitch in my laptop. It wasn't functioning properly. However, I hope we will have a more productive session next time. In the meantime, please continue working on your project and update me regarding the same.
20/11/23, 16:57 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Okay ma'am. So I now have to start with the projects? As in actually do them?
24/11/23, 22:30 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: I am a proud Edoofian!

25/11/23, 21:02 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL

27/11/23, 15:41 - Ananya: Good morning, Nicole!

Did you know that India and Africa share a rich history of diplomatic and trade relations that dates back centuries? The strong bond between these two regions has been further strengthened in recent years through collaborative efforts in various sectors, including trade, infrastructure, and technology.
Let us cherish this amazing bond, and start our session !
27/11/23, 15:42 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Good morning Ms Ananya. I hope you doing well!
27/11/23, 15:42 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: This is an interesting fact that I didn't know about.
27/11/23, 15:45 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: My apologies for not submitting my weekend activity. Can I please have a chance of submitting it before the end of the day?
27/11/23, 15:45 - Ananya: Well, As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? Did you manage to do that?
27/11/23, 15:47 - Ananya: Alright, you can submit it by 3:30 PM.
27/11/23, 15:48 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Okay thank you ma'am.
27/11/23, 15:51 - Ananya: Now, before diving into our session, I want to ask if you remember your projects or not?
27/11/23, 15:59 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Spirit of Competition is one's urge to work harder than others by displaying higher levels of skills so that they can be the best in whatever they want to achieve.

I remember when I started my grade 8 in South Africa. I was afraid about failing because everything was knew to me e.g the teachers, students and even the subjects were different. I tried my best that year and surprisingly I did quite well in my studies. So that made me realize that I was actually capable of doing far much better so I suddenly had the urge to become the best. And I did in grade 9. I was the top student in all my subjects and even in sports. 

So the Spirit of Competition is a good thing. But competing with yourself and trying to be better than yesterday is what I strongly recommend. Because competing with others might make you lose focus of what you really want and you might lose your way.
27/11/23, 16:00 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: I remember them.
27/11/23, 16:00 - Ananya: Great! You know while I was traveling to the office today, something really important struck my mind as a mentor. Due to this, I have a really important question for you.
27/11/23, 16:01 - Ananya: Well, I read you response and I completely agree with your perspective on the Spirit of Competition. Your personal experience highlights the transformative power of challenging oneself and striving for improvement. It's commendable how you turned your initial fears into motivation and achieved success. Your emphasis on competing with yourself and focusing on personal growth is particularly insightful. It's a powerful reminder that the true essence of competition lies in self-improvement and becoming better than yesterday. Keep up the great work, and thank you for sharing your inspiring journey!
27/11/23, 16:04 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Okay ma'am.
27/11/23, 16:06 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Thank you ma'am!
27/11/23, 16:07 - Ananya: Well, are you aware of the intent and motive behind your EWYL Projects?
27/11/23, 16:11 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Well not really...

27/11/23, 16:44 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Okay I now completely understand.

Let's start our session with an interesting tidbit about India. Did you know that the concept of 'zero' (0) as a mathematical digit was invented by Indian mathematician Aryabhata?

It's a remarkable contribution that has had a profound impact on mathematics and science globally. ðŸ¤¯
04/12/23, 16:51 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Good afternoon Ms Ananya
04/12/23, 16:51 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Yes I think I've come across that interesting fact before.

04/12/23, 20:04 - Ananya: EWYL projects has made me a different person I have changed as I have confidence and I now believe in myself. At first I was nervous about the project and sometimes I thought about giving up but the mentors kept on helping me and pushing me. And this helped me a lot as now I have confidence that I can do this even during my exams I had confidence that I have never experienced in my life.
04/12/23, 20:04 - Ananya: Well, I was expecting a response from your end; however, since our session time is over, let us connect in our next session, which is on Thursday

09/12/23, 18:48 - Ananya: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!
09/12/23, 23:06 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: So I'm going to record the activities I've done this past week instead of the upcoming week?
09/12/23, 23:07 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: And what is the difference between the time spent on each activity and the average time spent per activity?
09/12/23, 23:07 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: And when do I have to submit this work?
10/12/23, 22:40 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: I am a proud Edoofian!
10/12/23, 22:40 - Nicole EWYL23E0718: Do I only have to use Microsoft Excel for this project or can I also use WPS Office?
