18/11/23, 16:17 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!

25/11/23, 21:02 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL
26/11/23, 02:39 - Paul EWYL23E0410: In my opinion, the spirit of competition is about striving to do your best and challenging yourself to improve. It's not about winning at all costs, but rather about pushing yourself to be the best you can be. I think it's important to have a competitive spirit, The true value of competition is in the personal growth and development that it can bring.
 The spirit of competition can definitely influence the way we approach challenges and goals. It can give us the motivation and drive to push ourselves harder and aim higher.
27/11/23, 13:32 - Paul EWYL23E0410: Good morning
27/11/23, 13:33 - Ananya: Good morning, Paul! 

I read your response, and absolutely, I completely agree with your perspective on the spirit of competition. It's not just about winning; it's about personal growth and challenging ourselves to improve. Having a competitive spirit serves as a powerful motivator, driving us to push harder and aim higher in the pursuit of our goals. The true value indeed lies in the journey of self-improvement and the positive influence it has on our approach to challenges. Well said! üåüüëè
