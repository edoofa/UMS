13/06/23, 16:09 - Tenzin: Greetings *Taisha*,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some important news with you regarding our mentorship. I have recently been offered an exciting opportunity to take up a new role as the Head of the Division of Student Welfare, specifically focusing on the well-being of Edoofians in India. I am thrilled about this new responsibility and the chance to make a positive impact.
13/06/23, 16:11 - Taisha EWYL23E0131: Wow congratulations sir  this is wonderful, l am happy for you
13/06/23, 16:17 - Tenzin: Thank you so much!
13/06/23, 16:17 - Tenzin: I wanted to take a moment to explain why I have taken up the role in the Division of Student Welfare. I believe it's important for you to understand my motivations and how my experiences have shaped my decision.
13/06/23, 16:18 - Taisha EWYL23E0131: Okay  l understand that very well sir.
13/06/23, 16:19 - Tenzin: One of the main reasons I decided to take on this role is because I have had the privilege of interacting with Edoofians in India face-to-face for almost 2 years. Through these interactions, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges and struggles that students often face when they come to India. It can be a completely new and unfamiliar environment, and students may encounter various interactions and influences that can sometimes lead them astray or make poor choices.
13/06/23, 16:19 - Tenzin: I firmly believe that it is our responsibility to ensure that students have a supportive and safe environment in which to pursue their education and personal growth. I want to help prevent situations where students may be influenced by wrong choices or misguided information. By being part of the Division of Student Welfare, I can actively work towards creating awareness, providing guidance, and supporting you throughout your educational journey.
13/06/23, 16:20 - Taisha EWYL23E0131: Woow this good
