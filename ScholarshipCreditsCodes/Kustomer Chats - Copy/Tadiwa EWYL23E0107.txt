10/06/23, 16:06 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week’s Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better—together. It’s why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger—as successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!
10/06/23, 16:14 - Tadiwa EWYL23E0107: Yes l learned a lot in developing my network on social media and also in the surrounding community too due to this awesome Edoofa, l have got effort for my friends to achieve good life with Edoofa, better bright future as am about to have with Edoofa.

I was told to create a whatsapp group where l always encourage my friends for them to understand how good life is with Edoofa, as my experience Edoofa makes a person become creative and confident too.

In my community like at school l tend to tell my friends, classmates about this Scholarship program which is very helpful and now they understand better and this makes me become much confident towards my network building and l hope it will be as big one hundred times it is like now.

With this program l can see a bright future since one will be more confident and creative, using our skills to solve some problems we face along the way.

17/06/23, 18:27 - Tadiwa EWYL23E0107: Hello, l as a proud Edoofian l went through some research about the two entrepreneurs from those you once shared with me, am going to share about Nigel Chinakira and Ruvheneko Parirenyatwa.

Nigel Chinakira is a very popular person who is the founder of Kingdom bank which is one of the famous banks in Zimbabwe. He went through hard situations until he achieve these great ones, he took risks and actively involved in various ventures aiming the brighter one at the end and he achieved it.

Ruvheneko Parirenyatwa is a media personality, she started by having some adverts on radio and television shows and now she is well known, she goes for being an advocate of youth empowerment and social change and now she achieved the big dreams

Taking these two on my side as Tadiwa Magumise, l found only two similarities am taking some risks aiming for my bright future for example willing to go for studies abroad many and also having my A level combination l risked too since it is one of the hardest. The other similarity is going for adverts, am going for some as a student since l do some computer science projects and help those need help too, so l use some social media adverts to help others aiming for me to be much skillful towards this task.

The dissimilarities are as follows, Chinakira use to this as a group of others am sure, am willing to go for it personal and later on employ others also my wish is to develop my country to a digital world class having a lot of softwares named after my name

Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!
