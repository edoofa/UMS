13/03/23, 07:50 - Jasmine Kaur: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

24/03/23, 12:17 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Ready for your dose of Wednesday wisdom?

I want to ask you a question: Have you Despised Wealth?

The concept of wealth has been a topic of much debate and discussion for centuries. While some view wealth as a means to achieve success and fulfillment, others may view it with suspicion or even disdain. However, it is important to understand that ethical wealth creation is possible and can be a force for good in the world. In this regard, it is essential to examine our own perspectives on wealth creation and consider how they may impact our relationship with money, status, and success.

Read today’s lesson in detail and let's have a detailed discussion in our upcoming session. I am sure today’s lesson will lead to many fruitful discussions and will assist you in planning better for your journey toward wealth creation.

REMINDER Make sure to complete this activity before our tomorrow's session and submit it when I will ask for it.
WE HAVE OUR SESSION TODAY FROM 8:30 am to 10:30 am
Kindly be on time!

I have seen that sometimes it's the internal forces that bring me down and keep me backwards, and not always other people and factors bringing me down. It might be laziness and other flaws and I should challenge myself through that inorder to succeed
25/03/23, 23:56 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

I am pleased to observe that a majority of you comprehended well, the message  that was conveyed in this week's Wednesday wisdom. It brought me great joy to go through student’s perspectives on wealth creation and the mindset essential for embarking on this path.

I have a special Saturday assignment for you. The objective of this assignment is to help you understand the steps you can take to prepare yourself for wealth creation. The assignment will encourage you to identify their goals, develop a financial plan, and cultivate the mindset and habits needed to achieve financial success.

Here are some instructions to make it easy for you to work on this assignment:
1. Goal Setting: The first step towards wealth creation is to set clear and achievable goals. In this section, write down your short-term and long-term financial goals. Explain how each goal will contribute to your overall financial success.
2. Financial Planning: A financial plan is a roadmap that outlines how you will achieve your financial goals. In this section, develop a comprehensive financial plan that includes strategies for budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management. Identify the resources you will need to achieve your financial plan and explain how you will access them.
3. Mindset and Habits: Wealth creation is not just about having a financial plan; it is also about cultivating the mindset and habits that will help you achieve your goals. In this section, identify the mindset and habits that are necessary for financial success. Explain how you will cultivate these qualities in yourself and develop strategies to overcome any obstacles that may arise.
4. Conclusion: In this section, summarize your findings and discuss the importance of preparing yourself for wealth creation. Reflect on what you have learned throughout the assignment and discuss how you will apply these principles in your own life.

27/03/23, 20:58 - Jasmine Kaur: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

01/04/23, 18:39 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL22E0963: Wealth is abundance of money and valued possessions. This may be money and property but in plentiful.
Wealth is important to a person as it has several benefits. Wealth gives one the opportunity to fulfill their their future goals and dreams. Wealth provides a steady flow of income when one does not work and ensures financial liquidity. Wealth also gives financial freedom and one does not have to worry about employment or jobs
01/04/23, 18:39 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL22E0963: Firstly, I would like to make an introduction on wealth. On what it is and it's importance. Wealth covers a wide range and variety of aspects.

01/04/23, 19:07 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL22E0963: People nowadays are focused on securing a suitable job and work however they don't know the importance of having a sustainable financial future. For one to have a sustainable financial future they have to take certain steps to achieve it. 
Firstly, one has to invest in themselves. This includes gaining information and knowledge on career and future. This also includes gaining skills to support yourself and your goals  and support career advancement
Secondly, one has to work and earn with what they like to do. It may be hobbies and activities that one can learn and use to make money for make investments.
Furthermore, one has to have a budget plan and also spend wisely. Time and money are valuable and have to be spent wisely. In order to have a proper planned future one has to spend their time on essential life tools such as knowledge and gaining skills, and spend money with wisdom to have a stable financial future
04/04/23, 07:44 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL22E0963: Despising Wealth 
When one despises they are eluded and they miss the chance to create wealth. Wealth is a great life bargain that let's one lead a fulfilling life. Wealth has many benefits and advantages that lead me to conclude that I do not despise wealth. I see wealth as an opening to greater and better opportunities.
To begin with, wealth leads to success and a fulfilling life. When one acquires wealth they are surrounded by different skills they get in their way to get wealth hence they are prone to success due to all the skills and knowledge they have after their journey of acquiring wealth. When one has success it will eventually lead to a life of fulfilment
Wealth also can be used as a tool to do the greater good. People tend to associate and wealth with bad things such as corruption hence they despise wealth and don't see anything good coming from it. However wealth can also be used to elevate others in forms of employment creation and helping the poor and the needy. 
Furthermore, wealth is important as it also benefits other people. The community benefits off of the opportunities created by wealth. They may be better living conditions and other things that make life easier. This creates a win-win situation as not only the person who is wealthy benefits, but also those around and people in the community
In conclusion, wealth is not to be despised as it had positive effects on people and once one focuses on the negative view of it they are eluded by it hence missing an opportunity to have a successful and fulfilling life
