09/12/23, 18:42 - Unknown: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

17/12/23, 14:27 - Patience EWYL23E0862: Benjamin Franklin was an esteemed employee of the local bank in his town. He was known for his diligence and honesty that resonated throughout his work. Despite his accomplishment,he lived a humble life. He preferred simplicity to honesty over extravagance and pretentiousness. Benjamin firmly believed in the virtues of integrity. His job required dealing with huge sums of money and sensitive information. Benjamin  handled it all with great caution and confidentiality. His honesty was never under question. One day while auditing , he stumbled upon a discrepancy. An enormous amount of money had been siphoned off from the bank accounts and had not been reported. He was buffed and disturbed. Benjamin had a duty  to report it but he also knew it could lead to a scandal, tarnishing the bank's reputation. He decided to investigate himself before informing his superiors . His investigation led him to a shocking discovery. The source of the discrepancy was traced back to the Bank's manager. The manager of the bank was a man named Richard Cooper. He had been embezzling money from the bank for years. The thought of this truth petrified Benjamin. Richard was a well respected figure in the community . It would be hard for anyone to believe that he was the culprit behind the theft. Yes, the evidence was irrefutable. Benjamin was perplexed. He respected Richard but he could let his crime go unrevealed. His moral compass guided him to do the right things. He decided to confront Richard privately. He hoped Richard would do the right thing and confess his misdeeds. The confrontation was tense, and Richard vehemently denied the allegation. Benjamin tried to negotiate with Richard proposing that if he confessed and returned the money, he would merely report the incident as a mistake but Richard remained stubborn and arrogant. Benjamin left the meeting disappointed . He realized that Benjamin would not come clean so easily. He had to disclose this to the authorities  despite the repercussions. Benjamin reported his findings to the police and the bank's board directors. The news spread like wildfire. The bank and the entire community was in shock. Richard was arrested and taken into custody. He still denied the allegations, blaming Benjamin for framing him. The bank was thrown into chaos, and its reputation began to falter. Amidst all this, Benjamin stood strong . He defended his actions and provided all the evidence he gathered. He was determined to bring justice. The trial was lengthy and intense. Benjamin testified against Richard. Despite Richard's attempts to sway the court. The evidence was too compelling to ignore. Richard was found guilty of embezzlement and was sentenced to jail. Benjamin was hailed as a hero by many. But the damage to the bank's reputation was already done. Benjamin, however took the responsibility of rebuilding the bank's image. He became the new manager and started implementing rigorous checks and balances. His efforts seemed to work as customer trust began to slowly rebuild. Benjamin's strict measures and transparent operations attracted new customers to the bank. He also initiated financial literacy programs to educate the masses about the banking system. People appreciated this gesture, appreciating the bank's efforts to connect with its customers. Benjamin upheld his honesty and good will throughout this storm. It certainly was not an easy task but he managed to ride through it with determination and integrity. There were moments of self doubting, moments when he questioned his decision. But whenever such thoughts surfaced he reminded himself of the moral duty  and his commitment to honesty. Years later the bank was not only recovered but was thriving under Benjamin's leadership. The community trusted the bank again and respected Benjamin for his courage and honesty. Benjamin was not just an honest banker , he was a beacon of truth in the world where such virtues are overlooked. His story continues to inspire many to this day. Benjamin's actions serve as a crucial lesson about integrity. In today's world, honesty is a virtue that holds immense power and value. Every person can make a significant difference if they choose to uphold it. A man whose integrity was tested, and came out shining brighter. A man who reinforced the belief that honesty truly is the best policy. His story continues to inspire and remind us all about the values of honesty and integrity. It is a testament that even in the face of adversity , one can choose to remain honest and uphold their values.
