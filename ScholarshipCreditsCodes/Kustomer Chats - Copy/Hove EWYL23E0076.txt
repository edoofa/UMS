08/04/23, 17:33 - Aditi Kapoor: Dear Students,
I hope this message finds you well. 

\"Consistency is the foundation of achievement. Stay consistent in your actions, and you will achieve your goals.\"

As we discussed in Wednesday's lesson, consistency is key to achieving your goals. In order to assess your understanding of this topic, I am requesting that you submit a brief write-up on what you learned from the lesson and your discussions with your mentors, how you plan to apply it to your daily routine. Please submit your responses before your next Scheduled Session (11\/04).

Also I want you to write a heartfelt message to your mentors, discussing the obstacles you are encountering that are preventing you from maintaining consistency in your sessions and EWYL submissions.

Remember, consistency is not just about doing something once, but about making a habit of it. So, let's work together to build consistent study habits and achieve success!","transform":"

24/04/23, 15:24 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian, ready for a motivational monday?

In a remote village, there lives a hardworking farmer who owns a farm. Over the years his grapery yields rich crops, and the farmer is very successful. He has three sons, who are young and energetic but never worry about working. As the farmer grows older, he begins to worry about his sons’ future.

Then he becomes very ill and feels that his death is coming soon. He calls his sons and says,

“Dear sons, I see my death approaching, but I want to share a secret before you all leave. These areas have treasure hidden inside. Dig the whole area after my death, to find it. ”

The old farmer died. The sons start digging for money without leaving any part of the field but nothing is found. In any case, digging their fields leads to healthier crops and results in higher incomes. These earnings make the sons realize what their father means.

What according to you is the moral of the story?

a. Hard work always pays off. The fruits of hard work are always sweet.
b. Be Selflessly kind
c. both a & b
24/04/23, 15:27 - Hove EWYL23E0076: I think  a

04/05/23, 15:38 - Aditi Kapoor: Dear Proud Edoofian,

I hope you are doing well. This message serves as a gentle reminder for your Wednesday lesson. It is important to continue learning and developing your skills in order to advance in your career. Please take some time to go through the lesson, take notes on any important information, and complete the assigned tasks. Remember, investing in yourself is always a wise decision.

Happy learning!
04/05/23, 15:39 - Hove EWYL23E0076: With my understanding of these principles I got that they are interlinked so as to bring out the best in a person and also to give one a successful future.These principles also teach one how to conduct themselves and command destiny.They show that one has to plan about the future and be certain enough to achieve the goals. They help one to stay focused on their goals and dreams for example the principle of Desire shows us that one has define or decide their goal about the future then put maximum effort to it.Also teach one to be patient and never to take failure as an option for example the principle of Faith which states that the negativity in people can be changed to positive if we as people have belief and stay focused on our dreams and goals.Through the state of imagination one can draw a future and also plan ahead. These ideas will be brought to ground and worked on to bring out the best of success in a person.
Planning is also another principle to pave way to success.One learns more ideas and concepts from others through partaking in group discussion talking about the plans and helping one another to decide on the future.Many of the plans might fail but only one well executed plan will be a success.
04/05/23, 15:39 - Hove EWYL23E0076: The one I found easiest to understand and apply is the principle of desire this principle I found it easy as it is the key success by this one has to first take note of what they want to achieve in the  future then they try by all means to put all effort into achieving it.For example if one wants to be a successful they lawyer during their high school life they are the ones who are mostly expected to be participative in debates and discussions as this will help in improving their confidence ,critical thinking skills and also proper communication skills.
One needs to determine themselves fully to the to the goal,and then put all effort to execute their goal.It might take long and exhausting time along the journey to success but one needs to execute themselves fully to their goal.One should not be pushed to attain their goal but they should be self driven and focused on their goal.One should not set their goal to achieve more money but they should set their goal based on success.
04/05/23, 15:45 - Hove EWYL23E0076: Thank you

08/05/23, 15:29 - Hove EWYL23E0076: Thank you I will do so
08/05/23, 16:42 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello Hove
08/05/23, 16:42 - Aditi Kapoor: Your understanding of the interdependence of these principles is insightful and accurate. Indeed, these principles work together to help individuals achieve their goals and attain success.
08/05/23, 16:42 - Aditi Kapoor: The principles of Desire and Faith, for example, emphasize the importance of having a clear goal and a strong belief in oneself and one's abilities. These principles can help individuals stay focused and motivated in the face of challenges or setbacks. Similarly, the principle of Imagination encourages individuals to visualize and plan for their future, helping them to identify opportunities and make informed decisions.
08/05/23, 16:42 - Aditi Kapoor: The principle of Planning also plays a crucial role in achieving success. By taking the time to carefully consider their goals and the steps needed to achieve them, individuals can increase their chances of success. Group discussions and collaboration can also be valuable tools in the planning process, as they allow individuals to share ideas and perspectives and identify potential obstacles or opportunities.
08/05/23, 16:42 - Aditi Kapoor: It is important to note, however, that failure is often a natural and necessary part of the journey towards success. The principles you mentioned, such as Faith and Patience, can help individuals stay resilient and focused even in the face of setbacks. By remaining committed to their goals and persevering through challenges, individuals can ultimately achieve the success they desire.
08/05/23, 16:46 - Hove EWYL23E0076: All clear and I understand thank you
08/05/23, 16:47 - Aditi Kapoor: Great! It has been sometime since we have not connected
