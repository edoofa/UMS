25/10/22, 22:28 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

25/10/22, 23:25 - Dolly EWYL21E0249: As ready as I can be
25/10/22, 23:26 - Unknown: Great to hear that! SO can you please brief me about the 3 projects we do at EWYL Program?
25/10/22, 23:29 - Dolly EWYL21E0249: I forgot i only still remember community building
25/10/22, 23:36 - Unknown: No worries, let me help you.
25/10/22, 23:39 - Dolly EWYL21E0249: Thank you
25/10/22, 23:41 - Unknown: So our three projects are 
1. Corporate Alliance
2. Community Building
3. African School Reform
25/10/22, 23:42 - Dolly EWYL21E0249: Okay we can move on
25/10/22, 23:50 - Unknown: So Dolly! Did you recall any of it now?
25/10/22, 23:51 - Dolly EWYL21E0249: Yes sir
25/10/22, 23:54 - Unknown: Great! So, I want you to start working on these projects! You should for now focus on the corporate alliance project.
25/10/22, 23:55 - Dolly EWYL21E0249: Yes I understand
25/10/22, 23:56 - Unknown: Apart from this, I want you to continuously be active in the community-building project because that is our end goal, right? To be able to give back to society, and be the guiding light for others, who lack such opportunities as us.
25/10/22, 23:57 - Dolly EWYL21E0249: Yes I understand
26/10/22, 00:00 - Unknown: Great! I guess that should be fine for now. Also, we shall now be connecting on Friday for our next session, and tomorrow shall be the lesson day! I hope you are clear about the Wednesday Lesson and Saturday Activity?
26/10/22, 00:15 - Dolly EWYL21E0249: No I'm not clear on that activity
26/10/22, 00:26 - Unknown: No issues, the Saturday activity shall be based upon the Wednesday lesson, where you would apply the learnings of the said lesson in some task that shall be shared with you.
26/10/22, 00:27 - Dolly EWYL21E0249: Okay thank you
26/10/22, 00:37 - Unknown: Great! Hope to see you in the next session, meanwhile, I want you to wholeheartedly follow the Proud Edoofian Ritual! Have a blessed day ahead.
26/10/22, 00:39 - Dolly EWYL21E0249: Thank you sir
26/10/22, 10:06 - Dolly EWYL21E0249: 3
26/10/22, 23:00 - Unknown: Greetings Dolly! I notice that you have chosen 3 as the option, which means that you are not quite clear with the Proud Edoofian Ritual. Let me explain it to you.
26/10/22, 23:01 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”.
26/10/22, 23:01 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
26/10/22, 23:01 - Dolly EWYL21E0249: Greetings sir I am a proud edoofian
26/10/22, 23:03 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

26/10/22, 23:05 - Dolly EWYL21E0249: Thank you
27/10/22, 00:28 - Unknown: Glad to see the ritual being performed Dolly! Let's make it a habit so that it keeps filling us up with positivity every day, and reminds us to be grateful for the wonderful opportunity we have been blessed with.
27/10/22, 00:28 - Unknown: Hello, My Dear Proud Edoofian.

We all know that \"History is Written by Winners\", but not everybody knows the discipline, dedication, sacrifices, time, and efforts put behind it.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the kind of mindset a winner possesses, and about the person who carved his way from the bottom to the top, and even beyond. The story of a basketball player turning into a lethal black mamba on the court, the habits he formed, and the mindset he forged, to turn into a winner, is inspirational and the most practical way to better oneself every single day. You will learn a lot of different things from this lesson, about the attitude, instinct, and character of a true all-round winner.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

\"A goal is not always meant to be reached; it often serves simply as something to aim at.\" –Bruce Lee

The above quote more or less means True success is all about working towards meaningful goals and dreams.

And this was somewhat the idea we learned and discussed in our Wednesday Lesson as well, the mindset of a winner and the habits that lead to it.

In this week's activity, you shall be putting this to use in your own working zone, by creating a list of targets\/goals, that you shall aim to achieve in a week. For a suggestion, you can start by setting up a number of Schools you would try connecting to in a week, or the number of companies you shall reach out to, or the number of fellow community mates you would tell about edoofa.

This list, you shall share this with your mentors, and they would also keep a note of it. At the end of the week, you shall discuss with them, whether or not were you able to achieve the target, and what kind of mindset change did this activity lead you to.

I hope you all will try to push your limits and aim at the sky always. This activity should be a part of habit building, which would make you a better and more organized individual and professional.

Happy Learning, and Blessed Weekend.
