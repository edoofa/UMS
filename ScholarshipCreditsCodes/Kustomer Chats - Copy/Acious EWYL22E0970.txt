Good afternoon ma'am I hope I found you well well today. 

Preparing for an examination needs proper preparation mentally and physically. I always study as is it my last day of studying together with polishing my calcative skills by creating myself hard tasks daily. Through continuous study and solving complex problems it gives me an edge advantage over others. Studying at nights is another factor that I always take into action, it might he 3-4 hrs daily and then I have an enough sleep and before doing anything else in the morning, I then write down everything that I have read about to see if I remember well.

19/09/23, 17:46 - Acious EWYL22E0970: Yes, I'm currently under so much pressure and nervous too on doing the 3rd project
19/09/23, 17:47 - Acious EWYL22E0970: Thank you maam
19/09/23, 17:50 - Acious EWYL22E0970: I have approached the students of the  Brillion College so far who are currently doing their Upper 6 and I'm yet to open a group for some of them. A community that I come from consist of some students who do drug abuse at an early stage and sometimes having a conversation with them is quite difficult at reasoning.
19/09/23, 17:55 - Unknown: I understand that you're feeling pressure and nervousness, and that's  totally normal, especially when you have something important to do.  Let's break down how you can manage these feelings step by step:
19/09/23, 17:56 - Unknown: At first I want to know the reasons behind the pressure and then we can come up with solutions accordingly
19/09/23, 18:02 - Acious EWYL22E0970: Firstly, many students do ask if it's scam or not, and others tend to make it a scam just after explain the whole idea to them
2ndly. I can say I completely understood all about Edoofa ranging 80-90%. The 10-20% knowledge I kind of lack seems to make me nervous
19/09/23, 18:05 - Unknown: I appreciate your concern about the students in your community who are  facing challenges with drug abuse. It's essential to address this issue  and help those who may be struggling. Here's a way to approach it:
19/09/23, 18:06 - Unknown: Please do not worry at all
we will decide the plan right away
19/09/23, 18:06 - Unknown: Step 1: Build Understanding
Start by talking to your friends and community members about your concerns. Explain that you care about their well-being and the future of your community.
19/09/23, 18:06 - Unknown: Step 2: Share Your Story
Share your own journey and success with getting the Edoofa scholarship and studying in India. Let them know that you faced challenges too but worked hard to achieve your goals. You can say something like, "I faced difficulties too, but I didn't give up. If I can do it, so can you."
19/09/23, 18:07 - Unknown: Step 2: Share Your Story
Share your own journey and success with getting the Edoofa scholarship and studying in India. Let them know that you faced challenges too but worked hard to achieve your goals. You can say something like, "I faced difficulties too, but I didn't give up. If I can do it, so can you."
19/09/23, 18:07 - Unknown: Step 3: Highlight the Benefits
Explain the benefits of education and making positive choices. Share how education can open up opportunities for a better life, better job prospects, and a brighter future. Emphasize that education is a way to break free from challenges like drug abuse.
19/09/23, 18:07 - Unknown: Step 4: Offer Support
Let them know that you and others are there to support them. Encourage them to seek help if they're struggling with drug abuse. Share information about local resources or support groups that can provide assistance.
19/09/23, 18:08 - Unknown: Step 5: Be Patient and Empathetic
Understand that changing behavior is not easy. Some students may be defensive or resistant to change. Be patient and empathetic, and don't judge them. Let them know that you care about their well-being.
19/09/23, 18:08 - Unknown: Step 7: Be a Role Model
Continue to be a positive role model in your community. Show through your actions that education and making good choices are worthwhile and lead to success.
19/09/23, 18:08 - Unknown: Remember, it may take time for your message to sink in, but by being  persistent, supportive, and a living example of positive change, you can  make a difference in the lives of those around you. Your concern for  your community is admirable, and your actions can inspire others to make  better choices for their futures.
19/09/23, 18:10 - Unknown: I am going to share few resources with you which proves the authenticity of Edoofa as a prestigious institution. Please do not worry about that too.
19/09/23, 18:11 - Unknown: I will be sharing the resources on the EWYL group right now.
19/09/23, 18:12 - Acious EWYL22E0970: Okay. I'm following
19/09/23, 18:13 - Unknown: I have shared the resources there
19/09/23, 18:15 - Unknown: Now I want to set a target and I will also send a plan to achieve that target.
This is regarding the community building project so are you ready for that?
19/09/23, 18:16 - Acious EWYL22E0970: Yes I am
19/09/23, 18:17 - Unknown: Before that let me address one more concern of you feeling underconfident 
You know, it's important to realize that feeling confident and being good at talking to people isn't something you're just born with. It's more like a skill you can learn and get better at over time, just like learning to ride a bike or play a musical instrument.
So, if you ever feel nervous or unsure when you have to speak in front of others or talk to your friends, don't worry, that's completely normal! But the good news is, you can become more confident and better at talking to people with practice.
19/09/23, 18:18 - Unknown: Coming to the Goal/Target : Connect with at least 40 students before our next session  and you should be able to submit at least  15 filled Edoofa forms.
19/09/23, 18:18 - Unknown: Plan:

1. Target Identification: Identify specific groups of students who may benefit from Edoofa, such as those interested in higher education abroad or scholarships.

2. Elevator Pitch: Prepare a concise and persuasive pitch about Edoofa, highlighting its benefits, scholarship opportunities, and how it can help them achieve their educational goals.

3. Use Online Platforms: Leverage social media, student forums, and educational groups to connect with potential students. Share Edoofa's mission and the link to the forms.
19/09/23, 18:18 - Unknown: 4. Personal Outreach: Encourage one-on-one conversations with classmates, friends, and acquaintances, explaining how Edoofa can assist them in their educational journey.

5. Time Management: Allocate specific hours each day or week for outreach and follow-ups. Create a schedule to ensure consistent efforts.

6. Follow-Up: Maintain a record of contacted students and regularly follow up with reminders, additional information, or answers to questions.
19/09/23, 18:18 - Unknown: 7. Progress Tracking: Keep a log of interactions, the number of forms distributed, and the number of filled forms received to track progress toward the goal.
19/09/23, 18:20 - Acious EWYL22E0970: Okay maam, I'll do that
19/09/23, 18:21 - Acious EWYL22E0970: Thank you for the points stated above

The more students you will interact with, the better you will get.
