12/10/23, 17:35 - Lordwell EWYL23E0760: Ok thank you
12/10/23, 17:41 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Lordwell!
How are you?
12/10/23, 17:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Before we begin, as you have come on the EWYL Line, you have already completed some basic formalities. Now, I would like to talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.

I kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let me know.
12/10/23, 17:43 - Lordwell EWYL23E0760: Greetings ma'am thank you
12/10/23, 17:44 - Lordwell EWYL23E0760: The student is unavailable at the moment due to final exams that he is preparing for so you can put on hold the sessions
12/10/23, 17:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
12/10/23, 17:47 - Saloni Rastogi: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)

Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@edoofa.com, and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
12/10/23, 17:47 - Lordwell EWYL23E0760: Ok thank you Ma'am
12/10/23, 17:49 - Lordwell EWYL23E0760: Ok ma'am I will do so thank you
12/10/23, 19:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Noted!
17/10/23, 23:36 - Lordwell EWYL23E0760: I'm a proud Edoofian
17/10/23, 23:36 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!
