16/03/23, 16:09 - Mitchelle EWYL22E0945: Morning mam
17/03/23, 01:10 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings Mitchelle

I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you
17/03/23, 01:12 - Mitchelle EWYL22E0945: Thank you Ms Jasmine
17/03/23, 01:14 - Jasmine Kaur: Please remember these things clearly:

1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we will be working on two projects.
17/03/23, 01:14 - Jasmine Kaur: From now onwards all our sessions will be conducted on the EWYL Line.
17/03/23, 01:14 - Mitchelle EWYL22E0945: I understand mam
17/03/23, 01:15 - Mitchelle EWYL22E0945: So we won't be using the group
17/03/23, 01:15 - Jasmine Kaur: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *8:30 AM-10:30 AM*
17/03/23, 01:15 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes now the group is only the important information related to your queries.
17/03/23, 01:16 - Mitchelle EWYL22E0945: Oky mam
17/03/23, 01:17 - Mitchelle EWYL22E0945: But l choose Monday and Thursday
17/03/23, 01:18 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes dear I know but those batches are completely filled and to cater a large number of students at one time does not benefit anyone. 
So I switched your group to Tuesday and Friday. I hope you are comfortable with it.
17/03/23, 01:20 - Mitchelle EWYL22E0945: Oky mam
17/03/23, 01:33 - Jasmine Kaur: See you in the session tomorrow.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

Ready for your dose of Wednesday wisdom?

I want to ask you a question: Have you Despised Wealth?

The concept of wealth has been a topic of much debate and discussion for centuries. While some view wealth as a means to achieve success and fulfillment, others may view it with suspicion or even disdain. However, it is important to understand that ethical wealth creation is possible and can be a force for good in the world. In this regard, it is essential to examine our own perspectives on wealth creation and consider how they may impact our relationship with money, status, and success.

Read today’s lesson in detail and let's have a detailed discussion in our upcoming session. I am sure today’s lesson will lead to many fruitful discussions and will assist you in planning better for your journey toward wealth creation.

REMINDER Make sure to complete this activity before our tomorrow's session and submit it when I will ask for it.
WE HAVE OUR SESSION TODAY FROM 8:30 am to 10:30 am
Kindly be on time!

27/03/23, 19:01 - Jasmine Kaur: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

3. Mindset and Habits: Wealth creation is not just about having a financial plan; it is also about cultivating the mindset and habits that will help you achieve your goals. In this section, identify the mindset and habits that are necessary for financial success. Explain how you will cultivate these qualities in yourself and develop strategies to overcome any obstacles that may arise.

I hope this message finds you well. As your EWYL progresses, it is important that you stay up to date with your assignments and coursework. In order to ensure that you are able to move forward with the new lessons, I want to remind you that you must complete all of your previous assignments by the end of this week.

It is essential that you take the time to thoroughly review and complete your previous assignments. Doing so will not only help you to understand the lesson better, but it will also prepare you for the upcoming lessons. Failure to complete the previous assignments may result in a delay of the new lessons, and ultimately, it may impact your EWYL progress.

Therefore, I urge you to make the completion of your previous assignments a priority. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to seeing your completed assignments and to sharing the new lessons with you soon.
