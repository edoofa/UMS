12/08/22, 22:58 - Thubalethu EWYL22E0407: Greetings to you
13/08/22, 17:07 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times pere week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these att

14/08/22, 18:42 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

16/08/22, 17:38 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
How was your long weekend?

Let me educate you about the Indian independence day which was yesterday due to which we had a long weekend!
Independence Day, in India, is a national holiday celebrated annually on August 15. Independence Day marks the end of British rule in 1947 and the establishment of a free and independent Indian nation. It also marks the anniversary of the partition of the subcontinent into two countries, India and Pakistan, which occurred at midnight on August 14–15, 1947.

Isn’t this interesting?

24/08/22, 23:28 - Thubalethu EWYL22E0407: What really inspired me the most is that if one volunteers to do something then gain something for example, according to miss Mellisa Moyo she gained community skills. I promise to work hard and also follow on Mellisa's footsteps and even do extra better than what she did.
24/08/22, 23:50 - Unknown: The Wednesday Wisdom Lesson this week will focus on three business success stories that went from rags to riches. Additionally, social learning is a very effective method of learning. You can learn from the mistakes and accomplishments of others, so you don't have to figure everything out on your own, for instance.

Your mentors will have a thorough discussion in our forthcoming session about what you think were the factors that led to the success of the three panellists listed here after you have carefully listened to the audio file and read the PDF.

Happy learning!

25/08/22, 23:00 - Unknown: What did you understand from the three business success stories?
