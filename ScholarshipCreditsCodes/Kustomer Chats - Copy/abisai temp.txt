20/06/23, 15:38 - abisai temp: That's very true
20/06/23, 15:46 - Ananya: Greetings, My proud Edoofian!
How are you today? Are you ready for your session?üöÄ
20/06/23, 15:53 - abisai temp: Greetings Ms. Ananya.Yes I am.
20/06/23, 15:54 - Ananya: May I know if you were able to complete your Saturday activity?
20/06/23, 15:59 - abisai temp: I wasn't able to.It seems like it had a reference from the lesson of entrepreneurs.And I think I didn't attend the lesson.
20/06/23, 16:00 - Ananya: You must have failed to follow your EWYL ritual, that's why you missed your wednesday lesson!
20/06/23, 16:30 - abisai temp: I'm very sorry Ms. Ananya. I'm aware of the Tuesday and Friday lesson then the Wednesday and weekly newsletter and I think I didn't receive the newsletters last week.
20/06/23, 16:36 - Ananya: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
20/06/23, 16:36 - Ananya: After this, you will be receiving lessons and activity.
20/06/23, 16:40 - abisai temp: Well noted.Thank you.
20/06/23, 16:42 - Ananya: Now, today I wanted to ask about your progress in the projects. Are you facing any challenges?
20/06/23, 16:51 - abisai temp: I'm still connecting with the headmasters.Some of the  headmasters are blueticking me and some haven't answered yet.In my community building project most students of my community are Edoofians.I shared  my group link to people around Zimbabwe and connected with them.I added you in the group so that you can help me with posters I can send as you said.
20/06/23, 16:56 - Ananya: Sure, While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,

1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
20/06/23, 16:57 - Ananya: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe.
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5‚ÄôS which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5‚ÄôS of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

20/06/23, 16:57 - Ananya: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
20/06/23, 16:57 - Ananya: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!üéâ
20/06/23, 16:57 - Ananya: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countriesüìç
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
