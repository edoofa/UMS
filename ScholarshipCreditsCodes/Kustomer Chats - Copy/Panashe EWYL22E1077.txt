12/09/23, 12:59 - Panashe EWYL22E1077: From all the 3 quotes that Mr Angad Singh shared ,they all bring out that hardwork is what needed for me to succeed in all my endeavors. As a student I must be able to :Seek support, Set realistic goals, learn from setbacks, Develop resilience, focus on solutions and these would help me get stronger everyday.
12/09/23, 13:08 - Panashe EWYL22E1077: Also that when I was reading the Edoofa Pledge I realized that Edoofa community wants each and everyone student to strive achieving the best out of whatever we learn. Use education not for personal interest but also for the world around us to be improved. As an individual whilst taking this pledge it gives me a sense of belonging, loved and being cared for, unity amongst (I) and others.

12/09/23, 13:15 - Unknown: You should submit at least 15 forms of students and at least 5 school forms per week.
12/09/23, 13:15 - Unknown: This target only requires you to be consistent with your efforts and in no time you will be able to fund all your education.
12/09/23, 13:16 - Unknown: I see the potential in you and I know you will be able to do it.
12/09/23, 13:16 - Panashe EWYL22E1077: First challenge is that I'm not able to reach out to students and the ones I reach would show some interest and then later lose interest.

12/09/23, 13:21 - Panashe EWYL22E1077: Alright ma'am will try that idea. Thank you
12/09/23, 13:21 - Unknown: Just be honest and consistent throughout. It will eventually ensure that you are stating out facts and there is nothing fake. Show them evidences. Try explaining then through fee comparison and comparison between quality of education
12/09/23, 13:22 - Unknown: No worries dear. I just want you to push your limits and work hard. This will help in enhancing your social skills and persuasion skills. You are at gain. You are gaining skills and scholarship credits.
