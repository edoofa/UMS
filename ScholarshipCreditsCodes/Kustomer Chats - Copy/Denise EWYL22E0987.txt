10/06/23, 13:26 - Tenzin: You will be sharing the Proud Edoofian mantra every day to mark your attendance and when you won't be having your sessions on Tuesday and Friday, you will be receiving a task or interesting story to learn from.
10/06/23, 13:26 - Tenzin: And on Wednesdays I will also share the lesson with you so come around 12PM to receive the lesson
Similarly, I will share the Saturday Activity on Saturday so come over around 12PM to receive the same.
10/06/23, 13:27 - Denise EWYL22E0987: Understood üòå everyday 5 minutes before 12PM  I should mark my presence
10/06/23, 13:28 - Denise EWYL22E0987: Or rather attendance

10/06/23, 13:31 - Tenzin: Yes Attendance
10/06/23, 13:31 - Denise EWYL22E0987: I understand
10/06/23, 13:31 - Tenzin: I would like to introduce you to the Wednesday Lesson first
10/06/23, 13:32 - Denise EWYL22E0987: Okay.. What is it about?
10/06/23, 13:32 - Tenzin: Dear proud Edoofians,

I hope this message finds you well and filled with enthusiasm for another exciting Wednesday lesson. Today, we have something special in store for you. Our focus will be on a book titled "The Start-Up of You," a thought-provoking read that offers valuable insights and learnings applicable to our personal and professional lives.

To make the most of today's session, I encourage each and every one of you to diligently read the accompanying PDF. Take your time to absorb the concepts, anecdotes, and strategies shared within its pages. The Start-Up of You presents a compelling perspective on how to navigate the ever-changing landscape of the modern world, emphasizing the importance of adaptability, resilience, and seizing opportunities.

Remember, the lessons we learn together shape our growth and shape us as individuals. As proud Edoofians, we strive for continuous improvement and seek knowledge from every available resource. "The Start-Up of You" provides a roadmap for success and empowers us to forge our own paths, adapt to change, and embrace new opportunities.

I am confident that today's lesson will inspire you, challenge your thinking, and equip you with valuable tools to navigate the ever-evolving world. So, let's dive into the material with curiosity and an open mind, and let's engage in meaningful discussions with our mentors to maximize our growth potential.
‚Äã
10/06/23, 13:32 - Tenzin: It is about a book called Startup of you
10/06/23, 13:39 - Denise EWYL22E0987: This is interesting
10/06/23, 13:40 - Denise EWYL22E0987: Does that mean every Wednesday I receive a book?
10/06/23, 13:40 - Denise EWYL22E0987: Summary
10/06/23, 13:54 - Denise EWYL22E0987: Or it's always just some form of wisdom?
10/06/23, 13:54 - Denise EWYL22E0987: Not particularly a book
10/06/23, 14:17 - Tenzin: Yes you will be sharing your understanding and we will discuss on Thursday for Wednesday and similarly for Saturday we will be discussing on Monday
10/06/23, 14:17 - Tenzin: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week‚Äôs Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better‚Äîtogether. It‚Äôs why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger‚Äîas successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!
