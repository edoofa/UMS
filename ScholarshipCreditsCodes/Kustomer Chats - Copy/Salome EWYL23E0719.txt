We've all heard experts advise us to concentrate, eliminate distractions, and commit to mastering one thing. This guidance is undoubtedly valuable, and the more I study successful individuals from various fields‚Äîbe it artists, athletes, entrepreneurs, or scientists‚Äîthe more I am convinced that focus plays a pivotal role in their accomplishments.

Together, we'll explore strategies and ideas that can help you navigate the complex landscape of choices and find your true calling.
Read the PDF very carefully and we will connect in our upcoming session.

Till Then
Happy Learning!

29/10/23, 03:18 - Salome EWYL23E0719: Good evening,my apologies for submitting this assignment late.
29/10/23, 03:20 - Salome EWYL23E0719: I was not feeling well but luckily l found time to research and wish to share a story l once read about.
29/10/23, 03:22 - Salome EWYL23E0719: I would like to talk about Jane Eyre is the main character in Charlotte Bront√´'s novel of the same name. I once did literature in my advanced level and we did this novel and l loved it. She is a young woman who has faced many hardships in her life, including poverty, abuse, and the death of her loved ones.       Despite these challenges, she remains strong, determined, and resilient.       She is an inspiring character because of her strength, intelligence, and courage.                  Jane is an orphan who is raised by her cruel and abusive aunt.       She eventually leaves her aunt's home and becomes a governess at Thornfield Hall, where she meets Mr. Rochester, the owner of the estate.       Jane and Mr. Rochester fall in love, but it turns out that Mr. Rochester is already married to a woman who is insane and locked away in a room in his house.
29/10/23, 03:25 - Salome EWYL23E0719: Mr. Rochester asks Jane to marry him, but she refuses because she doesn't want to be a part of a bigamous marriage.       She leaves Thornfield Hall and eventually becomes a teacher at a girls' school.       Mr. Rochester's wife sets Thornfield Hall on fire and dies in the flames.       After this, Jane returns to Thornfield Hall and finds Mr. Rochester blind and crippled from the fire.                       So Jane decides to stay with Mr. Rochester and care for him.       Even though he is disabled and has lost everything, she still loves him and they eventually get married.    It's a really beautiful story about love and forgiveness, and it's also a story about perseverance in the face of hardship.       Jane Eyre is a really inspiring character and a great example of someone who never gives up.
It's really amazing how much Jane goes through and how she still finds the strength to keep going.       I think it's also inspiring how she stays true to her values and doesn't compromise her integrity, even when it's really hard. I really think Jane is a role model.
29/10/23, 03:27 - Salome EWYL23E0719: I think Jane is a great example of someone who is strong, brave, and compassionate.       She's someone who shows that it's possible to overcome adversity and still be a good person.      Her story is relevant today.
Even though it takes place in a different time period.  Some of the issues that Jane faces, like poverty, inequality, and social injustice, are still relevant today.       Jane's story shows that even in difficult circumstances, it's possible to find strength and hope.
29/10/23, 03:27 - Salome EWYL23E0719: In conclusion l can say  Jane's story is a great reminder that even one person can make a difference.       She shows that it's possible to overcome adversity and find happiness, even when the odds are stacked against you. I think her story could encourage people to be strong, compassionate, and resilient, no matter what life throws at them.  I could say Jane is a feminist icon.

04/11/23, 13:22 - Salome EWYL23E0719: Once upon a time, there was a young man named Daniel who was fascinated by the world around him. He longed to explore the far-off lands he had read about in books and dreamed of meeting new people and experiencing different cultures. But there was one problem - he had no money to fund his travels.
Then, one day, he stumbled upon a mysterious object that would change his life forever. It was a small, golden coin with strange markings on it. He had never seen anything like it before. When he picked it up, he felt a strange tingling sensation in his fingers.



That night, Daniel had a vivid dream. In the dream, a wise old woman appeared before him and told him that the coin he had found was a special, magical coin that would allow him to travel anywhere he desired. All he had to do was close his eyes and think of a place he wanted to go, and the coin would take him there.
When Daniel awoke, he wasn't sure if the dream was real or just a figment of his imagination. But he decided to test it out. He held the coin in his hand and closed his eyes.


As Daniel focused his thoughts on a place he had always wanted to visit, he felt a warm, tingling sensation throughout his body. Suddenly, he felt as if he were being whisked away by a strong wind. When he opened his eyes, he found himself standing in the middle of a bustling marketplace in Marrakesh, Morocco. He could smell the aroma of spices and hear the sounds of merchants haggling with customers. He was in awe of the vibrant colors and sights that surrounded him.
Daniel realized that his dream had been real and that the coin truly did have magical powers.


For the next few weeks, Daniel traveled the world using the magic coin. He visited the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal in India, and the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt. Everywhere he went, he met interesting people and learned about their cultures. He felt like he was on the greatest adventure of his life.
But as time went on, he began to feel homesick. While he loved exploring the world, he realized that there was no place like home. He decided to use the magic coin one last time to return to his own country.
04/11/23, 14:16 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

As part of your Saturday Activity, I encourage each one of you to dedicate some time to journaling for just one day.

Your journal can be a canvas for your dreams, fears, aspirations, and daily experiences. When sharing your journal, feel free to discuss your insights, challenges, and any personal growth you may have experienced through the process.

07/11/23, 13:23 - Salome EWYL23E0719: From the moment I was born, my life has been filled with experiences that have shaped my faith. From my childhood days in church to my years as a teen, I have witnessed and experienced many miracles and moments of grace. These moments have led me on a journey of faith, one that continues to this day.

 "As a child, I remember attending Sunday school and hearing stories about Jesus and his miracles. I was in awe of how he performed miracles and helped others in need. I remember feeling a sense of wonder and hope as I heard these stories. These stories and experiences in my childhood helped to shape my faith and instilled in me a sense of compassion and love for others.
My faith has not only brought me strength and comfort in my own life, but it has also inspired me to help others. I have seen the power of faith in action through my volunteer work and community service. I have witnessed how faith can transform lives and bring people together. It is my hope that my own faith can continue to make a positive impact on the world.

 Through my faith, I have gained a new perspective on the world around me. I have learned to see the beauty and wonder in every moment. I have also come to appreciate the importance of compassion, kindness, and forgiveness. My faith has given me a greater appreciation for life and all its gifts.

I don't know wht u think of this üôà
07/11/23, 13:37 - Unknown: Salome, thank you for sharing your deeply personal and touching reflection on your faith journey. Your story resonates with the power of faith and its ability to inspire kindness, compassion, and transformation. It's a beautiful narrative of how your childhood experiences and faith have led you to a life filled with meaning and purpose.

Your ability to recognize the beauty and wonder in every moment and appreciate the importance of compassion, kindness, and forgiveness is a testament to your growth and maturity. Your faith has certainly given you a unique perspective on life and the world around you.

Your journey is both inspiring and valuable, and I believe your faith will continue to make a positive impact on the world. Keep embracing the power of faith, and never underestimate the influence you have on others through your own experiences and beliefs.

Your reflection is truly meaningful and well-articulated. Don't hesitate to share more of your thoughts and experiences; they are both valuable and appreciated.
