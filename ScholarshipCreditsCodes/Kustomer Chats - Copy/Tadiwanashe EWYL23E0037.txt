Check out this amazing fact for Factual Friday and tell us if you want to visit there in the comments below!
18/07/23, 12:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Tadiwanashe!
How are you?
18/07/23, 12:58 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
18/07/23, 12:58 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0037: Good morning. I am well thanks
18/07/23, 12:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù


2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.

How are you doing?

Yesterday, I shared an exciting lesson focusing on the incredible world of student leaders. You are the future leaders, capable of shaping a better tomorrow. Embrace this responsibility with humility and a genuine desire to make a difference. We are proud of you, Edoofians, and we believe in your ability to inspire and create positive change.

In our session today, we will discuss:

2. Project Updates

Please excuse me for the delay, but I am all here now.

I would like to extend our session by 15 minutes so that we make the most out of the session.
20/07/23, 13:50 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0037: I‚Äôm a student leader in the sense that I know my niche and excel in that field. Specifically in any rhetoric field that requires read  at ch and discourse eg. public speaking debate or model United Nations
20/07/23, 13:50 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0037: I intended to make the LPU teams for my niche the top in the country and world
20/07/23, 13:51 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0037: I have received more contact details and am currently trying to make contact with the school heads
20/07/23, 13:51 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0037: And also researching companies I can engage with
20/07/23, 14:06 - Saloni Rastogi: You are an exceptional student leader with a clear understanding of your niche, which is rhetoric and discourse. Your excellence in fields like public speaking, debate, and Model United Nations showcases your impressive communication skills and ability to engage others effectively. Your passion for these areas sets you apart, and I'm truly inspired by your dedication and commitment to honing these valuable talents. Keep shining as a leader and making a positive impact with your eloquence and expertise. Your passion and determination are truly commendable!
20/07/23, 14:07 - Saloni Rastogi: üçÉUPDATE
Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for the time being. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.

In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.ü™Ñ
20/07/23, 14:08 - Saloni Rastogi: As for the school project, did you reach out to other students and your peers studying in different schools?
20/07/23, 14:10 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0037: Thank you ma‚Äôam. I will indeed
20/07/23, 14:23 - Saloni Rastogi: Tadiwanashe you informed me that your school is already connected with us. So I would prefer that we reach out to other schools and then explain to them about Edoofa.

There are two ways to do that, first, by visiting the school physically.
20/07/23, 14:35 - Saloni Rastogi: This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
20/07/23, 14:36 - Saloni Rastogi: ;
20/07/23, 14:36 - Saloni Rastogi: l
20/07/23, 14:45 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0037: This is a feasible option
20/07/23, 14:45 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0037: Thank you for this Ms Vilsha. I think this works
20/07/23, 15:34 - Saloni Rastogi: Ms. Vilsha, I am Ms. Saloni.
20/07/23, 15:37 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0037: Apologies, Ms Saloni
21/07/23, 13:21 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0037: Good morning.  I am a proud edoofian

24/07/23, 13:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Tadiwanashe!
How are you?

I see you have not received the Saturday activity. This is so because you have not followed the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' on 22nd and 23rd.
24/07/23, 13:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian.

So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù
24/07/23, 13:19 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0037: I didn‚Äôt know it included weekends seeing as most sessions we‚Äôd regularly do during weekdays.
24/07/23, 13:20 - Saloni Rastogi: No worries Tadiwanashe, I can understand that.

I am sharing the weekend activity with you now. Please work on it and side by side, we can also discuss about the projects.
24/07/23, 13:20 - Saloni Rastogi: Dear Proud Edoofian,
We hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. As you all know, the Edoofa program has been an incredible journey for each one of you, providing valuable opportunities and experiences to shape your future. We believe that your voices and stories deserve to be heard by both your school heads and your fellow schoolmates.
We are excited to announce a special Saturday Activity where we invite you to create two videos‚Äîone addressed to your school heads and another for your schoolmates. In these videos, we encourage you to share your personal experiences with the Edoofa program and how it has positively impacted your life.
We also want you to apply all that you have learned in our recent Wednesday lessons on being a student leader. Use this opportunity to showcase your growth and development, and inspire others with your leadership skills.
In your videos, feel free to share anecdotes, challenges you overcame, and achievements you've accomplished through the Edoofa program. Share how it has helped you gain new perspectives, enhance your academic skills, and broaden your horizons. Let your enthusiasm and gratitude shine through as you express your thoughts and emotions about this wonderful journey.
Remember, your videos have the power to inspire and motivate others who may be considering joining the Edoofa program. By sharing your authentic experiences, you can help them make informed decision and embark on a transformative educational journey.
Once you have created your videos, please submit them to your EWYL Mentors

Best regards,
Team EWYL

24/07/23, 13:31 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0037: 
24/07/23, 13:46 - Saloni Rastogi: I have noted the concern, Tadiwanashe.

First of all, whenever you have students who have to enquire about Edoofa, share all the basic details with them.
24/07/23, 13:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe.
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5‚ÄôS which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5‚ÄôS of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
24/07/23, 13:49 - Saloni Rastogi: '
24/07/23, 13:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
24/07/23, 13:49 - Saloni Rastogi: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!üéâ
24/07/23, 13:50 - Saloni Rastogi: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countriesüìç
24/07/23, 13:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
