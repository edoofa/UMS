Its time for our Saturday Activity, I want you to delve into the realm of inspiration and write a detailed essay about a person whom you know personally and who embodies the remarkable trait of consistency. This individual has consistently demonstrated their dedication, determination, and unwavering commitment, becoming a true source of inspiration for you.

In your essay, please explore the key aspects of their life, experiences, and actions that exemplify their consistent nature. Describe how their consistent approach has positively influenced and impacted not only their own life but also the lives of those around them. Reflect on specific instances or situations where their consistent behavior or mindset has motivated you to strive for excellence or overcome challenges in your own life.

Additionally, analyze the qualities, values, or strategies that you believe contribute to their ability to maintain consistency over time.
I am excited to read your insightful essays and learn about the inspiring individuals who have demonstrated the power of consistency.

Check it out and let us know if you have experienced first hand or if you want to!
10/07/23, 14:07 - Michelle EWYL22E1039: "Age doesn't matter, it's just a number", a statement that has been said by most when trying to get out of tricky  situations, most times. But to me, it is mostly useful when I look at the person who inspires me the most. 
He is only older than me by 4 years and yet, I already find him as my role model and a person who greatly inspires me. He is one person who sets goals for himself monthly, which brings about great detail about his discipline and consistency, not to mention determination in what he wants to achieve. We are two worlds apart in terms of future goals and our goals don't align. He is mostly interested in building up a healthy body and a healthy mindset through exercising everyday. Myself on the other hand, am mostly interested in education, partly the medical field. Exercising enables him to handle even hard life situations by being able to endure pain. Exercising and working out requires consistency for good results to come out. From him, I copy a lot of desirable traits like enduring pain (especially when waking up to study), displine, consistency and most importantly, being able to handle most situations maturely, making educated and rational decisions. In the light of the above, the person I know personally and who embodies the remarkable trait of consistency is my brother, Hanson.

11/07/23, 13:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy Tuesday my proud Edoofian!
How was your weekend?

As per the Saturday activity, you are supposed to write a detailed essay about a person you know personally who embodies the remarkable trait of consistency. You are to explore their life, experiences, and actions that exemplify their consistent nature and describe how their consistency has positively influenced not only their own life but also the lives of those around them. 

So, in our session today, we will discuss:
1. Who is that personality and how have their ideas empowered you?
2. What work are you doing on the community-building project?
3. How many community-building forms will you submit this week?

I'm following
11/07/23, 13:08 - Saloni Rastogi: It's truly inspiring to hear about the person who serves as your role model and source of motivation, your brother Hanson. Age truly doesn't define the impact and influence someone can have on our lives. It's amazing that despite the small age difference, Hanson has already become such a remarkable example of discipline, consistency, and determination.
11/07/23, 13:08 - Saloni Rastogi: His commitment to setting monthly goals and working diligently towards them demonstrates a strong sense of purpose and self-motivation. Even though your individual goals may differ, you recognize and appreciate the valuable qualities he embodies. Taking inspiration from his dedication to building a healthy body and mindset through exercise, you have been able to apply traits like endurance, discipline, consistency, and mature decision-making to your own pursuits, particularly in your educational journey.
11/07/23, 13:09 - Michelle EWYL22E1039: True indeed!
11/07/23, 13:34 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share the progress on both projects?
11/07/23, 13:34 - Michelle EWYL22E1039: ....
11/07/23, 13:55 - Saloni Rastogi: Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for the time being. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.

In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.ü™Ñ

11/07/23, 14:38 - Michelle EWYL22E1039: Also, may I know how far I have gone with earning the scholarship credits if you don't mind?

21/01/23, 20:51 - Saloni Rastogi: And also, you have your first activity.
21/01/23, 20:51 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

A college student named Rachel was unsure of what career path to pursue after graduation. She talked to several professionals in different fields, but none of them seemed to fit her interests and skills. One day, she had a conversation with a mentor who asked her the right questions, such as \"What are you passionate about?\" and \"What do you enjoy doing in your free time?\" Rachel realized that her true passion was writing and storytelling. She decided to pursue a career in journalism and landed a job at a top news outlet.

We gained knowledge on how to ask intelligent questions. I'd like you to share with us any two questions you'd like to ask yourself as part of your Saturday submission. The questions that you may have been hesitant to make, the questions that put you in a difficult situation, the inquiries that will have a significant impact on your career and future. For example:  1. What is the limit of my current capabilities and how can I push beyond them to continue learning and growing?\"
2. ‚ÄúHow can I ensure that my actions align with my values and contribute to the greater good, rather than just maximizing my own success?\"

Looking forward to your response!
21/01/23, 20:51 - Saloni Rastogi: Please make a note of the following things:
1) No response will be accepted on the EWYL Group, it has to be done on the EWYL Line only.
2) I believe that you are aware that every morning you wake up, you need to follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' on the EWYL Line only. This ritual helps in keeping the family connected.
3) From now on, you have to reach out to me at your scheduled time of the session. In case you have not shared your activity\/lesson response to be within one hour of your scheduled session, I will mark that as a missed session and just to inform you that such a performance can go to the direct notice of the Academic Board of Edoofa under the defaulters' list. Make sure that you are punctual.
22/01/23, 16:06 - Michelle EWYL22E1039: Good morning how are you doing mentor?
22/01/23, 16:06 - Michelle EWYL22E1039: My questions would be:
1. What are the sacrifices one must make to achieve their goals
2. Is my current hard work worth the life I dream to have?
22/01/23, 16:06 - Michelle EWYL22E1039: I choose the first project please.

22/01/23, 16:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

How are you?
31/01/23, 17:45 - Saloni Rastogi: I am so glad that you have chosen the corporate alliance project but before any progress that we make it is important that we follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' here, on the EWYL Line.
31/01/23, 17:57 - Michelle EWYL22E1039: Good morning mentor. I'm very well thank you! How are you doing today? ?

- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.

- How do you intend to broaden this student community? In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.","transform":"
31/01/23, 17:59 - Michelle EWYL22E1039: Definitely!
31/01/23, 19:10 - Saloni Rastogi: So tell me Mitchelle, Before we begin, I firmly believe that it is very important that we know what exactly CORPORATE ALLIANCE means and what importance it can bring to our lives.
31/01/23, 19:10 - Saloni Rastogi: To start with, the term CORPORATE means 'relating to company\/group\/association'  and ALLIANCES mean a union or an association formed for mutual benefit'

Altogether, Corporate Alliances mean an agreement motivated by improved service for the customer and opportunity share for all parties involved.
31/01/23, 19:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Edoofa, introduced as one of our core Projects, brings with it an amazing platform for students to learn and upgrade themselves in this corporate world.

Are you excited to learn how you can do that all together in ONE project?
31/01/23, 19:12 - Michelle EWYL22E1039: Of course. I'm quite excited about it
31/01/23, 19:13 - Saloni Rastogi: Amazing Mitchelle!
31/01/23, 19:14 - Saloni Rastogi: So here are some unique benefits that this project brings to you:
‚ñ™Ô∏èThrough this project, you learn communication skills and networking.
31/01/23, 19:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Networking can be so beneficial in a student's academic as well as professional life. It helps them gain professional ties and improve creative intellect, and access various job opportunities*.

‚ñ™Ô∏èWhen we complete our higher education, most of the time we think that acquiring experience will help us to fetch better job opportunities in the future. And for this, we need to sit for interviews and represent ourselves most professionally.
31/01/23, 19:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Tell me one thing Mitchelle, when you will be sitting for your interview for a job vacancy, will the recruiter ask you 'What is written in the 8th chapter, under page 57 of your English book?'
31/01/23, 19:26 - Saloni Rastogi: I hope you have got me right?
31/01/23, 19:30 - Michelle EWYL22E1039: No please. They won't
31/01/23, 19:30 - Michelle EWYL22E1039: Exciting indeed!
31/01/23, 19:31 - Michelle EWYL22E1039: Of course
31/01/23, 19:31 - Saloni Rastogi: Of course not!
31/01/23, 19:32 - Saloni Rastogi: What will answer all their questions will be your business acumen and how well-aware you are about the profile. And for that, we surely need to represent ourselves in the best possible manner to outshine ourselves.
31/01/23, 19:32 - Saloni Rastogi: Right Mitchelle?
31/01/23, 19:36 - Michelle EWYL22E1039: Yes please
01/02/23, 00:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's connect tomorrow for the updates.

I will be sharing the Wednesday wisdom with you tomorrow!
