23/01/24, 19:55 - Elizabeth EWYL23E1000: 1. *THE POWER OF THOUGHTS* 

Thoughts are powerful things. In the first paragraph of the novel, Hill argues that thinking is more conducive to success than any other feature, including money, education, or specific knowledge about something. The man that  thinks  he can accomplish something is already a step forward toward the finish line.
The language of thought is your guide to understanding, generating, and directing more powerful thoughts so that you can live and work with more intention, joy, and success.
For example when one wants to start a business one has to come up with a proper plan before running the business.Our thoughts are immensely powerful. They determine how we feel, our decisions and our actions - every part of our life that you can control. Our thoughts are one of the most powerful tools we will ever have in changing our life. 
Our minds can be trained to only focus on one thought at a time, which ultimately gives ud the feeling of control. All we must do is keep it focused on uplifting thoughts until we form the same types of neural pathways. 
Our thoughts shape who we are and who we will become, as well as influencing our physical well-being and our emotional state. The power of the mind is a tool we are still discovering and just beginning to unleash.The Power of Thoughts Is a Creative Power You can use it to make changes in your life, and also to influence other people's minds. If you plant seeds, water them, and give them fertilizers, they will grow into healthy and strong plants.
 *HOW TO HARNESS THE POWER OF THOUGHTS* 
1. Be aware of your thoughts: Pay attention to the thoughts that come into your mind throughout the day. Notice if they are positive or negative, empowering or limiting. Awareness is the first step in making any change.
2.Challenge negative thoughts: When you catch yourself thinking negative or limiting thoughts, challenge them. Ask yourself if they are true or if there is another, more positive perspective you can take. Replace negative thoughts with positive affirmations or statements.
3. Visualize your goals: Use the power of visualization to imagine yourself achieving your goals. Create a clear mental picture of what you want to accomplish and how it will feel when you achieve it.Visualizing success can help you stay motivated and focused.
4. Practice positive self-talk: Pay attention to the way you talk to yourself. Replace self-critical or negative thoughts with positive and encouraging ones. Remind yourself of your strengths and capabilities.
5. Surround yourself with positive influences: Surround yourself with people who uplift and inspire you. Avoid negative or toxic influences that bring you down.The people you spend time with can greatly impact your thoughts and mindset.
6. Take action: Thoughts alone are not enough. Take action towards your goals and dreams. Use your thoughts to create a plan and then follow through with it.
23/01/24, 19:55 - Elizabeth EWYL23E1000: 2. *DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE*
The term  definiteness of purpose is something that you must create for yourself.
No one else will create it for you, and it will not create itself. What are you going to do about it? and when? and how? When you come to select your definite chief aim, just keep in mind the fact that you cannot aim too high.
For example write down a clear, definite plan by which the definite major purpose will be realised. This plan must state the maximum time allowed to achieve the definite major purpose. Also, a precise description of what one intends to give in return for its attainment, as there is no so such thing as something for nothing.
You can define your definite purpose by identifying your clear, specific goal in life, and visualizing a future where you have fulfilled your desires. Create a specific plan to achieve your goals, and start on it right away.
23/01/24, 19:55 - Elizabeth EWYL23E1000: 3. *THE MASTERMIND PRINCIPLE* 
A mastermind is simply two or more people who come together in a spirit of harmony, and who seek to work together to accomplish the same goal. Many of the most successful businesses in the world were the product of masterminds. Famous examples include: Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak - Apple.

 *Steve Jobs was a charismatic pioneer of the personal computer era. With Steve Wozniak, Jobs founded Apple Inc. in 1976 and transformed the company into a world leader in telecommunications.He went on to design the Apple II computer, over which he and Jobs clashed.Wozniak wanted its design to be open, with multiple expansion slots for hobbyists and tinkerers. Jobs favored a more closed design, but Wozniak's wishes won out.During the design stage, Jobs argued that the Apple II should have two expansion slots, while Wozniak wanted eight.After a heated argument, during which Wozniak threatened that Jobs should "go get himself another computer", they decided to go with eight slots. They met in the early 1970s when they were both working at Hewlett-Packard (HP). Jobs, an avid entrepreneur, recognized Wozniak's technical prowess and convinced him to join forces to create a personal computer.* 
 
The Mastermind principle was first introduced in Hill's 1928 book The Law of Success nearly ten years earlier). Hill defines a mastermind group as " a coordination of knowledge and effort, in a spirit of harmony, between two or more people, for the attainment of a definite purpose. "
 Think and Grow Rich In Think and Grow Rich, he talked about something called a  master mind alliance.   He goes on to describe a mastermind group as,  A friendly alliance with one or more persons who will encourage one to follow through with both plan and purpose.
 Hill defines a mastermind group as " a coordination of knowledge and effort, in a spirit of harmony, between two or more people, for the attainment of a definite purpose." No two minds ever come together without thereby creating a third, invisible intangible force, which may be likened to a third mind , also known as, the Mastermind.
‚ô°‚òÜThe memoirs contain thoughtful insights into the state of mind of this great thinker--how he dealt with failure, profited from defeat, turned adversity into advantage, and ultimately achieved happiness with his last wife, Annie Lou, happiness which had eluded him for most of his life.
23/01/24, 19:55 - Elizabeth EWYL23E1000: *4.FAITH AND VISUALIZATION* 
Hill emphasizes the importance of developing faith through repetition and practice. He suggests that by repeatedly visualizing and affirming our goals, we can cultivate unwavering faith in their attainment. In Think and Grow Rich, Napoleon Hill describes the importance of faith as: - Faith is the only known antidote for failure! - Faithgives life, power, and action to the impulse of thought!
If we can learn to think and believe in certain ways, then we can achieve our goals and become successful. The author states that by focusing on a passionate desire, having faith in oneself, training the subconscious to believe in success, and developing a detailed plan, anyone can grow rich. 
Faith is spiritual proof that things we cannot see or hear do exist and are true. For example, we did not see Jesus die for us or suffer for our sins, but we know through faith that He did. 
It would be an act of faith in something extraordinary and in the city where it could happen. It's not exactly a bold act of faith. Following a football team is an act of faith, loyalty and great expense. Biblical Imagining In contrast, by using parables, Jesus asked people to use their imagination to more deeply understand the Word of God.
A person can visualize in their mind's eye that they have attained whatever it is they are trying to manifest. They can observe how their life might be different, how their needs might be met, how they would feel, and how they would interact with the people in their life and the world.
23/01/24, 19:55 - Elizabeth EWYL23E1000: 5. *OVERCOMING FEAR AND PROCRASTINATION* 
 Hill explains that you can learn how to outwit the six ghosts of fear by recognizing fear as a state of mind and replacing your fears with positive alternate thinking. The six basic fears are poverty, criticism, poor health, loss of a loved one, old age, and death.
To avoid fear and procrastination get into the right mindset. For example, if you need to do something scary that you've been putting off, you can make yourself feel braver for long enough to get it done, by doing things like watching a motivational video, listening to energizing music, or engaging in encouraging self-talk.
Here are a few examples of procrastination: 
‚Ä¢Putting off studying for an important exam until the last minute. Putting off doing the laundry until there are no clean clothes left to wear. 
‚Ä¢Putting off going to the gym until the next day, even though you promised yourself you would go today.
23/01/24, 19:55 - Elizabeth EWYL23E1000: 6. *THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND AND THE BRAIN* 
The function of your subconscious mind is to store and retrieve data.Its job is to ensure that you respond exactly the way you are programmed. Your subconscious mind makes everything you say and do fit a pattern consistent with your self-concept, your  master program.   Your subconscious mind is subjective. 
The author portrays the Sixth Sense as "that portion of the subconscious mind which has been referred to as the Creative Imagination." While couched in somewhat mystical language about the 'Universal Mind' and 'Infinite Intelligence' Hill is talking about intuition or gut feeling.
 *Automatic functions* :
 It controls automatic bodily functions such as breathing, heartbeat, and digestion, without requiring conscious effort. 
 *Symbolic language* : 
The subconscious mind often communicates through symbols, dreams, and intuition, providing insights into our inner thoughts and feelings.An example of the subconscious mind in action would be our daily habits like brushing our teeth, driving or even watching TV. These are activities that we do on a regular basis and don't require much thought to complete. Another example would be if you have a goal to get in better shape.
The subconscious is the part of our minds that makes decisions without our needing to actively think about them. It's different from the conscious mind, which encompasses the thoughts we know we are having at any given moment.
Subconsciousness allows us to do things we don't have to think about, but we can alter them if we choose to. A good example of subconscious behavior is breathing. We don't have to think to breathe at all, but we can change how we control our breath and its pattern.
23/01/24, 19:55 - Elizabeth EWYL23E1000: 7. *PERSISTENCE AND RESILIENCE* 

With persistence, great sports teams come from behind to win the game. Great inventors with persistence work through research and development failures until they have a successful product. And with resilience, these people can fail and try again until they succeed. These people are empowered for success. 
For example a problem that was difficult to resolve - many solutions were tried, most failed, but people kept at it until it was solved. 
A project is going well and then is hit by an unanticipated issue that puts it at risk. Urgent action is needed. 
Resilience is what allows us to adapt to new circumstances, learn from our mistakes, and move forward after a setback. On the other hand, persistence is the firm continuance in a course of action in spite of difficulty or opposition.The Author emphasizes that persistence is a critical factor in achieving success in various fields. It suggests that individuals who succeed often have a burning desire to reach their goals and are relentless in pursuing them.
According to Hill, persistence is the ability to keep going even in the face of obstacles and setbacks.
He advises his readers to cultivate this habit in order to overcome any challenge that may come their way.
