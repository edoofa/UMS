12/07/22, 23:24 - Ananya: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

22/07/22, 18:20 - Kelly EWYL22E0137: I had a very  interesting story of a sailor and the sea which interprets how people can easily blame and give excuses for their failures . Just as the sailor blamed the sea, people also tend to give excuses for not succeeding in life and end up saying failure cannot be escaped.The lesson is to always have a posative mind even if when things are not going your way you should keep on trying as a dollar in the future is better than a dollar today.Always speak good to others because you might learn something from it too.
