For those who haven't had the chance to attend any events yet, don't worry! We encourage you to share your expectations from such gatherings. What do you hope to gain? What are your goals and aspirations when attending future events? This is a chance for you to articulate your thoughts and set intentions for your learning journey.

06/01/24, 14:37 - Pride EWYL23E0728: Good morning
06/01/24, 15:17 - Pride EWYL23E0728: So last year around October before I wrote my A level exams we embarked on a journey to a Boys high school called Mzingwane . We were hosted by the school for the Sciences seminar which occured for three days that is Friday for chemistry, Saturday for Biology and Physics separately  and Sunday for the practical for the three subjects.
  
There were thirteen schools present.My school, Matopo high school,Wanezi high school to name but a few. Upon our arrival the Chemistry students went the lecture theatre for the Chemistry lesson and some of remained behind and started our  sleeping places. Since Mzingwane high was a boys high there were no vacant dormitory areas for girls and so we used classrooms as sleeping areas. The cleaning was a bit challenging because there were not enough  cleaning equipment . Some had mops but no brooms. Others had no cleaning equipment at all depends and so we resorted to sharing as 13 schools. We had  our lunch which was quite delicious and then took a tour around the school. When it was bedtime we slept. To be honest sleeping was hard because regardless of the effort we made to clean the classrooms still had to much dust.

Day two was my day for I was also attending the classes unlike yesterday . We cleaned our rooms and went for breakfast. Warm milk, black tea, eggs Russians and bread it was a treat indeed. We were then separated that is if you were doing physics you'd go in the lecture theatre and biologist went to the Beit Hall. We blessed by the presents of Mr Jah a man well known for teaching physics in Bulawayo Province . We listed out the topics that were hard for us and he made them easier. He made them shorter and understandable. He gave us tips for the the exams that were nearby. I must say he was definitely good in the manner in every question he had and answer . The equations that we solved within 2 pages became a half a page. He was fast that we lost track of time üòÖ instead of him going home around 6 ( the agreed dismissal time) he went around 9. I was exhausted then but then I had enjoyed my day.ü•∞
 
Day three was a bit sad because we knew after the morning session we were going back to our schools leaving our new friends behindüò©.  We did our daily routine, cleaning and breakfast then to the lecture theatre. Arriving there we told to shuffle then form into groups of 5 of different schools. Students from you he same school were not supposed to be found in the same group. In this case team work and critical thinking was instilled for we did three practical questions which were quite tough. At the end we  did our closing remarks at the Beit Hall with the Biology students as a whole. We highlighted what we learnt in these three days . We went for lunch then yes left Mzingwane üòî. I feel as if three days were not enough because I didn't learn everything I wanted to know about physics and the fact I had met old friends namely Nonty ( Wanezi  high), Nyasha ( Zezani high ) and new friends too the likes of leonel( Wanezi high).. Arthur ( Gwanda high)


But I enjoyed üòäü§ç

20/01/24, 18:36 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, can you elaborate on them?
20/01/24, 18:41 - Pride EWYL23E0728: I used to learn at a boarding school right which is located at Maphisa growth point whilst I actually reside in Bulawayo . It hard for me to look out and conduct community building because already people in my area are saying things that are not  nice about Edoofa
20/01/24, 18:42 - Aditi Kapoor: Did you ask, maybe there is some misconception in their mind right?
20/01/24, 18:45 - Pride EWYL23E0728: My aunt is a teacher at a certain school in Bulawayo . Her colleague says that her daughter's  friend went to India through edoofa last year but is no longer going to school due money
20/01/24, 18:49 - Pride EWYL23E0728: Due to pending fees regardless of her doing projects
20/01/24, 18:59 - Aditi Kapoor: Pride, it's a different story with every student, can you provide her full name?

Then update you
20/01/24, 19:01 - Pride EWYL23E0728: But is there any possibility of an edoofian  going to school regardless of pending fees
20/01/24, 20:30 - Aditi Kapoor: That's actually not in our hands dear, it is the University's rules.
20/01/24, 20:30 - Aditi Kapoor: Hope this message finds you well! This Saturday's activity is an exciting opportunity to delve deeper into the principles of the book 'Think and Grow Rich" by Napoleon Hill ' discussed in our Wednesday lesson. Each of you is required to elaborate on one of the seven principles shared in the Wednesday Lesson. Provide a detailed explanation, and don't forget to include examples to illustrate the practical application of the chosen principle.

This task is crucial as it will not only reinforce your understanding but also prepare you for our upcoming session with mentors. Remember, the more detailed and insightful your submission, the more enriching the discussion will be.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarification. Looking forward to your insightful contributions!
20/01/24, 21:08 - Pride EWYL23E0728: I get you but if there's a possibility of that occuring what would have really occured
20/01/24, 21:08 - Pride EWYL23E0728: Sure
