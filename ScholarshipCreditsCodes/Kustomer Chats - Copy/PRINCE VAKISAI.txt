How are you?
20/10/22, 21:05 - Unknown: I will be sharing the Project details with you by today evening, I am excited to have you on board with me.
20/10/22, 21:05 - Unknown: I am happy to tell you that this weekend we are having our great Indian festival, Deepawali and you know this festival holds a special place in the hearts of all Indian families. So yesterday, everyone in our office wore Ethnic dresses and celebrate Deepawali's party where we exchanged gifts and lit up the office with diyas and candles.
Due to this, there was a delay in sending you the Wednesday lesson for this week.
Please see to it and we will have a session tomorrow on the same because I want to give you time to ponder and work on it.
20/10/22, 21:05 - Unknown: In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

How are you?
22/10/22, 01:07 - Unknown: As I shared yesterday in our session today on the EWYL Line, we will be discussing two crucial things:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. what have you learned about the Deepawali festival so far :fireworks: 

I am excited to discuss both things with you!
22/10/22, 01:15 - PRINCE VAKISAI: Greetings ma'am how are you
22/10/22, 01:19 - PRINCE VAKISAI: In the Wednesday wisdom i come to understand that we should be grateful for where we are and learn to do things good for others  
Let's not be materialistic but focused people doing things necessary in our lives.
22/10/22, 04:43 - Unknown: I am doing well, thanks for asking.
22/10/22, 04:43 - Unknown: I feel on the Wednesday lesson that the struggle exists to change us and our lives we struggle because it is the key to the path of our destination of what we want or what we want to become filled with challenges, knowledge, and so on. Without struggle, we humans won't be able to achieve what we have today.
We both have spoken on similar grounds and yes it was indeed a very inspiring tale.
22/10/22, 04:44 - Unknown: What do you know about Deepawali?
22/10/22, 04:45 - PRINCE VAKISAI: Yes sure
22/10/22, 04:46 - PRINCE VAKISAI: I don't know much apart from what I said 
Which I heard when I asked about this holiday when I saw many students going back to their places because of this holiday
22/10/22, 06:18 - Unknown: I would love it if you could research something about Deepawali and share it with me.
22/10/22, 06:57 - PRINCE VAKISAI: Owk
22/10/22, 07:03 - PRINCE VAKISAI: Diwali symbolizes the spiritual \"victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance\".

It is said that Diwali commemorates the day Prince Rama of Ayodhya, his wife Sita, and his brother Lakshman return after being exiled for 14 years. The prince was considered to be an incarnation of this Hindu Lord Vishnu and an embodiment of dharma (righteousness) and Sita an incarnation of Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth
22/10/22, 07:14 - PRINCE VAKISAI: Why Is It Celebrated? 
Deepawali is celebrated to welcome in the new year. The house cleaning, decorations, and prayer help to prepare observers for a fresh start and a prosperous year to come. The lights and family gatherings are a special time to come together with loved ones.
22/10/22, 07:15 - PRINCE VAKISAI: The significance of Deepawali

The festival of Deepawali is believed to be the ultimate victory of good over evil. The lighting of diyas and lamps is seen as the eradication of darkness, as we move towards a bright and hopeful future. It is an auspicious occasion that people love to celebrate with their family and friends.

What all you have to do for this:
-you have to speak about TRUST BUILDING
# in the video you have to speak about HOW CRUCIAL IT IS TO SHARE TRUE INFORMATION WITH EVERYONE. How it is a sad fact that people share wrong information about Edoofa. But we have to trust the people here, your counselors, mentors, and the whole Team.
- The video has to be made professionally: wear a shirt, have a decent background, and have a stable camera.

- the video has to be about 60-90 seconds long.

- *DEADLINE: WEDNESDAY (that is tomorrow), 10 AM
01/11/22, 22:05 - PRINCE VAKISAI: Owk i will ma'am

Will you be able to work on the video after 04:30 PM IST?

How are you?

Someone, who never gives up, or quits on the dream they see and really want to fulfill, no matter what. Moving through scorching heat, drenching rains, and heavy snow, they reach their destination and complete their journey. In this lesson, you will also learn, what happens when an entire community inherits this trait and keeps working on it. How recognition is earned and respect is gained through time, patience, and endless efforts.

So, in our session on the EWYL Line, we will discuss:
1) your views on the Wednesday lesson
2) *Google and Facebook reviews* (if it is not done)
03/11/22, 22:27 - Unknown: In case you have any pending responses left, please share them by today itself.
This November, I want that all the opportunities that I have like:
- *Edoofian of the week*
- *Projects other than our three ongoing ones*
- *Webinars*

to go to only those students who are responsible and serious about their sessions.
In case, I had to remind you more than once a week to follow the daily ritual, not only I would be taken aback to share these amazing opportunities with you but also all these interesting and learning lessons and activities will be stopped.
Make sure that from today onwards you follow the daily ritual and share your responses with me timely.
03/11/22, 22:27 - Unknown: Also for the month of *NOVEMBER*, I want that you put your focus on any one project, out of
1) Corporate Alliance\/Company Connect
2) Community Building
3) African School Reform 

Choose any *ONE*, and then we will put all our focus on it.
I want that this NOVEMBER, you earn and aim for LOTS OF SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS.

How did your weekend go?

This weekend's activity gave you a first-hand experience to fit yourselves in a small part of the leadership shoes. I wanted you to create a newsletter of your own. Similar to the ones you have enjoyed reading every Sunday from the founder's office.

In our session, we will discuss:
1) the newsletter that you have designed for the weekend activity
