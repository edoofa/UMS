19/09/23, 12:52 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: Studying according to my perspective is not about only being equipped enough to pass an exam but grasping and fully understanding the concept of all the information. My preferred method of studying is dedicating a period of time to studying a certain topic or chapter. After finishing the chapter I take a break and give myself time to refresh. As soon as my break is over I take a piece of paper and pen and try to summarise everything in my own words. If I have some questions from past exam papers relating to that specific topic or chapter I then attempt to answer them on a separate piece of paper. I close up my study session by comparing my own summary and answered questions to the material in the chapter. At the end of such a session I will surely have identified my weaknesses.
19/09/23, 12:52 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: Good morning ma'am.

19/09/23, 13:09 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Morning,
I hope you are in great spirits. So, how was your weekend?
19/09/23, 13:16 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: It was good ma'am, thank you for asking. How was yours.
19/09/23, 13:18 - Jasmine Kaur: I had a blessed weekend as well. Thank you for asking.
19/09/23, 13:18 - Jasmine Kaur: Till the time, I read your activity I would like to tell you that this week we will be focusing on Project 2 i.e. Community Building. So, first of all, I would want you to update me on your performance so far in this project.
19/09/23, 13:30 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: I have been verbally spreading the word and trying to recruit people. I no longer have the messages and pictures that really explain the program as I lost them on my previous cell.
19/09/23, 13:33 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, Did you ask me to share the messages again?
19/09/23, 13:34 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: Umm no ma'am, sorry for not doing so sooner.
19/09/23, 13:36 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, I will share the messages. May I know how are you reaching out to new students?
19/09/23, 13:45 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: Yes I been telling people my friends and neighbours to also reach out to people who might be interested on my behalf and refer them to me. I just explain to them about Edoof according to my knowledge and understanding.
19/09/23, 13:49 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, Let me help you out with the information.
19/09/23, 13:53 - Jasmine Kaur: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
Here is the message -
19/09/23, 14:05 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: Noted
19/09/23, 14:06 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe.
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5‚ÄôS which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

19/09/23, 14:22 - Jasmine Kaur: Here are some of the facts that will definitely help you out.

Today, I am thrilled to introduce you to a scholarship program that has the potential to fulfill all the dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA - Education For All. EDOOFA, initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in India, firmly believes that quality education should be accessible to all, irrespective of social or financial limitations. This exceptional scholarship program addresses the challenges of affordability and employability in higher education through its unique work-study model.


I am delighted to share that EDOOFA's scholarship program is currently benefiting over 100 schools in Africa, with more than 3,000 African students already reaping its rewards. School principals and teachers who play a significant role in our program enjoy exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Additionally, EDOOFA's Earn While You Learn Program helps students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation by providing opportunities to learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
In Zimbabwe alone, EDOOFA has enrolled more than 1,500 students in the program within the last year. Collaborating with over 100 schools, including partnerships with esteemed educational leaders such as Mr. Shorwi Kawadza, Principal of Hartzell High School, Mutare, EDOOFA has witnessed the success of more than 80 students who have already embarked on their journey to study in India.

22/09/23, 12:55 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: I understood that a freelancer is someone who works without being bound by a contract, hence he is self employed. This gives him the freedom to choose his own working hours and conditions. However a freelancer should be disciplined as he is his own boss and there's no one to keep him in check. He is also obligated to work harder in order to get himself more pay. Apart from that he also carries the burden of marketing his own work hence he should be familiar with marketing skills. Despite all the burdens there are a lot of pros to being a freelancer such a being self employed, working at your own set time, chance to learn new skills such as marketing among many others.

22/09/23, 13:28 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: Yes ma'am I am ready for the session.
22/09/23, 13:30 - Jasmine Kaur: Today, our session will be based on the quality of the forms that you submit for the Community Building.
Till the time, I read your Wednesday lesson. I would want you to share all the points that you discuss with your students.
22/09/23, 13:32 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: Ok ma'am.
22/09/23, 13:33 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, Please go ahead
22/09/23, 13:41 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: Firstly I tell them how rare it is to find an opportunity to pursue tertiary education abroad. I tell them that Edoofa can give them that chance at a cost that is much lower than that in their home country. I allow to do their own research on that. I tell them of the benefits of being an Edoofian such as career guidance, counselling, support throughout one's educational journey, assistance in all the processes from application for place at schools up to visa application and also the EWYL which gives them mentoring on life skills that the school syllabus does not teach and allows them to pay a portion of their fees through the credit points or Edoofa grant earned through one's performance in the sessions.
22/09/23, 13:43 - Jasmine Kaur: Great, How do you share this information?
22/09/23, 14:04 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: I do so step by step following up to make sure they understand.
22/09/23, 14:07 - Jasmine Kaur: That is great Nigel. So, I can expect that every student's form that you will submit will enroll. Right?
22/09/23, 14:43 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: Surely ma'am.

20/06/23, 15:22 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: Last week my mentor gave me an assignment to do a thorough research on four Zimbabwean entrepreneurs. I carried out a research on Strive Masiyiwa, Tinashe Mutarisi, Phillip Chiyangwa and Alex Mashamhanda. Of all these entrepreneurs Strive Masiyiwa seemed to be my favourite. From my research I discovered that there are some similarities and differences between me and the entrepreneur. Mr Masiyiwa is a compassionate and patriotic person and so am I. However the error he grew up in and the type of family he comes from are some of the differences between the two of us.



According to my research Strive Masiyiwa is a very compassionate person. He has given back to the community in various ways. Through his family foundation he has helped a lot of African orphans and given scholarships to African youths to study abroad. I also consider myself a compassionate person because it has always been and still is my goal to one day give back to the African communities when I make it. Strive is also a patriotic person. I describe him as patriotic because from my research there is a time in his life when he came back to Zimbabwe, then Rhodesia with the intentions of joining the guerilla movement to tackle the oppresive government. Although he never went through with it I consider him patriotic for the thought show that he had a lot of love for his country to the extent that he was willing to take up arms for it. Had I been born during that error I would have done the same and even today I have a great amount of love for my country and would be willing to do anything to defend its national interests, independence and sovereignty. Hence I think we share the trait of patriotism.

On the other hand Strive grew up during the pre colonial error of Zimbabwe. This differentiates him from me who was born and bred in the post colonial error of Zimbabwe. Besides that from my research it seems as if Mr Masiyiwa came from a well off family as evidenced by the ability of his family to send his abroad for education. Had I never known of Edoofa studying abroad would only have been a dream for me since because my family cannot afford to pay all the costs of studying abroad. These are the differences between the two of us.
20/06/23, 15:22 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: Good morning ma'am.
20/06/23, 15:22 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: I am a proud Edoofian!

20/06/23, 15:44 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Afternoon dearüåü

I hope you had a restful and rejuvenating weekend and you are in great spirits. Are you ready to make this week a productive and successful one?
20/06/23, 15:45 - Jasmine Kaur: While I review your Saturday Activity, I would like you to take this opportunity to share your progress on the project and set achievable targets for this week. It is important to establish realistic goals that you can confidently work towards and ultimately achieve.
20/06/23, 15:45 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: Yes ma'am I am ready.
20/06/23, 15:50 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: On the Community Development project, I have talked to number of people about Edoofa and shared the form with them. So far only one has filled the form and sent it back to me, others say they will get back to me once they have discussed it with their parents. So I'm hopeful that I will get a few filled forms back by the end of this week. However there are some individuals who seem to be skeptical about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
20/06/23, 15:59 - Jasmine Kaur: Well done on completing the activity with such dedication and enthusiasm. Your efforts are truly commendable.
20/06/23, 16:01 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, There are two things that we will be discussing today
1. Setting the weekly target
2. Educate students about the program 
First of all, let us talk about your target. I want you to set a target so that we both will be able to track your progress.
20/06/23, 16:03 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: My target this week is to have at least five filled forms by Saturday.
20/06/23, 16:06 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay and now how are you communicating with the students? May I know what all do you tell your students.
20/06/23, 16:13 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: First of all I tell them that they can get an opportunity to study abroad for an affordable price by applying on the Edoofa Scholarship Program which gives 50-100% scholarships to study in India to African students. The rest of the fees can be paid through the Earn While You Learn program which allows one to pay his fees by carrying out projects and earning scholarship credits.
20/06/23, 16:13 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: After that I send the informative posts and pictures you shared with me.
20/06/23, 16:15 - Jasmine Kaur: Do you send all the messages in one go?
20/06/23, 16:15 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: Yes ma'am.
20/06/23, 16:18 - Jasmine Kaur: Don't do this. 
First start by giving them an introduction to Edoofa. Then allow them to ask questions. Stay connected with them and clear all their queries. 
Use messages that I have sent in between conversations.
20/06/23, 16:20 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: Ok ma'am.
20/06/23, 16:41 - Jasmine Kaur: May I know that have you gone through the newsletter?
20/06/23, 16:52 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: Yes ma'am I have.
20/06/23, 17:09 - Jasmine Kaur: Great, What part you like the best Nigel
20/06/23, 17:28 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: I liked the quotes ma'am they inspire me to be creative, get out of my comfort zone and not put limits on everything that I do.
20/06/23, 17:47 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, they are indeed inspiring. Now, it‚Äôs time to wrap up our session. We will meet on Friday from 12:00 pm. Until then, I wish you a wonderful day ahead. Maintain your enthusiasm and eagerness to learn as we progress on this transformative path.
Have a lovely day ahead!
20/06/23, 17:52 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: Thank you ma'am, have a great day.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to appreciate your punctuality and commitment to our session today.
I also wanted to inquire about how you are doing. How has your day been so far?
23/06/23, 15:40 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: My day is good ma'am, thank you for asking. How is yours going?
23/06/23, 15:44 - Jasmine Kaur: I am very well dear. Thank you for asking
Now, let us begin our session. I trust that you have completed your Wednesday Lesson, and I am eager to review it. Please share your Lesson's understanding with me, as we delve into a productive discussion.
23/06/23, 16:03 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: From Wednesday's lesson I learnt that challenges are should be used as reasons to make it in life and not as excuses. One should find a way through his or her challenges and try to make a positive impact in one's community or the world at large after making it. One should always struggle to beat the odds, as in the case of Ellen Johnson, Sirleaf she became the first female president in a time where men dominated the political domain.
23/06/23, 16:04 - Jasmine Kaur: While I review your lesson, I would like you to take this opportunity to share your progress on the project
23/06/23, 16:08 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: I haven't made much progress ma'am, I have shared the forms but have received none back.
23/06/23, 16:11 - Jasmine Kaur: I am incredibly proud of you for the valuable lesson you learned from Wednesday's class. Your understanding that challenges should be seen as reasons to strive and succeed, rather than excuses, is truly commendable. It is a mindset that will undoubtedly lead you to great achievements in life. 
Well done Nigel
23/06/23, 16:12 - Jasmine Kaur: What are the challenges that you are facing Nigel?
23/06/23, 16:26 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: It seems as if people think it is a scam, but I will try approaching my targets face to face, tell them about Edoofa and then use the pictures and videos from Bulawayo as evidence just like I did with Esther. I think this method will be more effective.
23/06/23, 16:27 - Jasmine Kaur: Ofcourse Nigel
Let me share some more resources with you
23/06/23, 16:27 - Jasmine Kaur: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,

1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
23/06/23, 16:32 - Nigel EWYL23E0125: Noted.
23/06/23, 16:40 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe.
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5‚ÄôS which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5‚ÄôS of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
