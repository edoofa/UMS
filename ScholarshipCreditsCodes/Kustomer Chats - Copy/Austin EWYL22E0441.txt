10/11/22, 16:26 - Unknown: Before, We move forward, Let me share the Wednesday Lesson with you that got missed yesterday.

Wednesday Lesson

Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian,

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Deadline: Saturday 9 AM
Happy Learning.

27/01/23, 16:35 - Unknown: Greetings, Edoofian
I hope that you are in good health and spirits

I am sure that you might have noticed that we were not able to connect for our session yesterday.
Let me tell you why.

I would like to inform you that We celebrated our 74th Republic Day on Thursday with a colorful parade displaying military might and cultural diversity. This public holiday marks the anniversary of India officially adopting its constitution, making it a sovereign republic.

I am sure that you will be completing your Academic journey here with full zeal and with the surity of a successful career ahead.

We will connect now for our session on Monday.
As shared before, We will be discussing our plan for February, So, Please make sure that YOU reach out to me 5 mins prior to our session timings on Monday.

I wish you a blessed weekend ahead!
27/01/23, 16:53 - Austin EWYL22E0441: What time is our Monday session
27/01/23, 17:08 - Unknown: During your lunch hours, Austin?

31/01/23, 17:09 - Austin EWYL22E0441: I am a Proud Edoofian
31/01/23, 17:11 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

31/01/23, 18:01 - Unknown: Greetings, Austin

31/01/23, 18:01 - Unknown: May I know why did you missed our session yesterday?
31/01/23, 20:07 - Austin EWYL22E0441: My phone was dead had no electricity
31/01/23, 20:58 - Unknown: Austin, If you have an urgent commitment or task or if something like network or electricity challenge comes up, please notify me well ahead of time or before the session or even after the session that you will be unable to attend and explain the reasons for it. This clearly demonstrates your seriousness. We have students who texted to say they had power failures and would be unable to attend class at the usual time, which is understandable. However, as soon as their power was restored, they notified me and asked what they had missed due to their absence. Isn't this exactly what a sincere student would do?
31/01/23, 23:23 - Austin EWYL22E0441: It is
01/02/23, 06:52 - Unknown: Greetings, Austin
I hope that you are doing well
