03/03/23, 23:32 - Saloni Rastogi: I completely agree with you and I believe experiences make us feel alive: there are times when we live our lives and slowly let them pass us by. This can happen when you stick to the same routine day and night without doing anything new. Going through life in the same 'state' can be tedious, but an unforgettable experience will awaken your mind and soul.
03/03/23, 23:33 - Blessed EWYL22E0909: That's right

06/03/23, 16:44 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

06/03/23, 21:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy Monday _my proud edoofian_!
How are you?

In today's session, we will discuss:
1) Weekend activity
2) Projects
06/03/23, 21:08 - Saloni Rastogi: You know the opinions of both the question will completely differ with students but one thing that is common is that they strive to move ahead in life and take this motivation to next level. I have heard one quote on it, let me share it with you:
''One of the best ways to achieve career success is to keep assessing your performance. Don't wait for your annual appraisal – do it yourself. An ideal way to do this would be to identify quantifiable goals and set a timeline for achieving them. Start with setting short-term goals when you're new to a job.''

Your response just reflects how passionate you are towards your journey in the EWYL Program with me.
06/03/23, 21:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Did you message the Headmaster, Blessed?
06/03/23, 21:12 - Blessed EWYL22E0909: Yes l did and the form as well but he has not filled the form yet
06/03/23, 21:12 - Blessed EWYL22E0909: Ok am ready
06/03/23, 21:59 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me share some crucial information that will help him\/her in understanding the Edoofa Program better.
06/03/23, 22:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education   All.
06/03/23, 22:02 - Saloni Rastogi: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of lack of affordability and of employability in higher education. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!
06/03/23, 22:02 - Saloni Rastogi: Edoofa is a social for-profit organization that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!
06/03/23, 22:02 - Saloni Rastogi: Edoofa scholarship program is currently helping over 100 schools in Africa, and over 3000 African students are benefiting from our scholarship program. The school principals and teachers who are playing a significant role in our program are enjoying exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Now, to help the students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation, Edoofa has its own Earn While You Learn Program, which helps the students to learn skills and earn money in the form of scholarship credits to reduce their expenses.
06/03/23, 22:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his\/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. With the quality of education provided to the student completing high school, edoofa would want to transform your school’s every student into a person who’s so strong in the knowledge that he\/she becomes better than his\/her peers. Coupled with the Earn While you Learn program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he\/she has got more opportunities to chase him\/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development\/growth.
06/03/23, 22:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Now, It is time to explain with examples How Edoofa is revolutionizing the Education System on the African Continent. Examples create clarity. This is why they are used in all contexts as a tool to provide further understanding. When it comes to your conversation, examples play a significant role in your ability to effectively communicate the elements that you want the School Head to understand.
06/03/23, 22:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

_United College of Education_, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and _Respected Sir Adam Luthuli_ has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

06/03/23, 22:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Proud Edoofian, Now that we have shown the data of how Edoofa is benefiting the African Continent, Now it is the perfect time for us to show how Edoofa helps a particular school.

Schools that have partnered with us have seen higher rates of admission through shaping careers and facilitating higher education decision-making for students looking to study abroad in India through the famed Edoofa Scholarship Program which leads to life-transformation events for deserving African students.
06/03/23, 22:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, schools can be benefited in the following way:

06/03/23, 22:40 - Saloni Rastogi: I am so happy to see the school that you have shared, super proud of you?
06/03/23, 22:40 - Saloni Rastogi: The thing is that in such cases when the school fee per term is less than $100, we do not take up the call but if the Principal gives us a heads up that the students can pay nearly $2000 for their students, we can have a call.
06/03/23, 22:51 - Blessed EWYL22E0909: But most local and day school pay less than $100 as there school fees
06/03/23, 23:33 - Saloni Rastogi: I understand that. In such a case, try to research more on such schools that as term fees more than $100 because we would not like to pressurize or emphasis the students on paying $2000 for their higher education.
06/03/23, 23:34 - Blessed EWYL22E0909: Ok l understand now
06/03/23, 23:41 - Saloni Rastogi: We will discuss everything on Thursday, our next session since the organization is observing a holiday on Wednesday on the occasion of the Indian Religious festival-HOLI.
