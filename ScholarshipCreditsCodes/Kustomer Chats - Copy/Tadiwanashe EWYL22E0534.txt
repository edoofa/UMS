Please, edoofian,I want you to resume this knowledge and learning experience with me.

How was your weekend?
15/11/22, 18:41 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0534: I'm a proud Edoofian
15/11/22, 18:43 - Jasmine Kaur: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
15/11/22, 19:17 - Jasmine Kaur: Hola my proud edoofian,

16/11/22, 01:10 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay so Tadiwanashe, it’s important that we give directions to your projects now
16/11/22, 01:18 - Jasmine Kaur: So, let us give priority to community building project these 2 weeks
16/11/22, 01:29 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0534: Yes please
16/11/22, 03:58 - Jasmine Kaur: Are we on the same page about the project?

16/11/22, 04:31 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay
16/11/22, 04:31 - Jasmine Kaur: But, let us discuss the plan for it by then
16/11/22, 05:04 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0534: OK sir
16/11/22, 22:25 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings edoofian,
Let us discuss it in detail
16/11/22, 22:25 - Jasmine Kaur: 1. New Form to be shared:

Ensure that the form submitted by you  for applicant is the new form, not the older one, There should be Date of Application mentioned in the form, if not mentioned. get the form filled again.

(Logic behind: With date of application mentioned in the form, the counselor can plan before hand how to approach the application if the date is of few days ago. 
If date is not mentioned, then students who are re applying, they also get mixed in general leads since their old and new form are same, and counselor cannot differentiate whether the student is reapplying or not.)

16/11/22, 23:26 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay , thankyou edoofian
16/11/22, 23:26 - Jasmine Kaur: After that you will be informing them about :
2. What is Edoofa Program:

Make sure your applicants know what is Edoofa Program all about, brief introduction to Edoofa should be shared by you to the applicant so that the applicant can have clarity while filling out the form. 

(Logic:- You tend to ask the applicants just to fill out the application form, but when the applicant asks about the program you share that the counselor will brief them about the same. Due to this, students who might be looking for a scholarship in their home country also tend to apply. You should share about the Edoofa Program and brief the applicant on a few key details so that the counselor can cross-question them during counseling.)
16/11/22, 23:27 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0534: Okay sir
16/11/22, 23:28 - Jasmine Kaur: The following text can be edited and used by the you to ensure every Student is aware of the program Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 5 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 3000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains! Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. They are associated with more than 90 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Their associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with them for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already.
16/11/22, 23:30 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0534: Okay sir thank you

19/11/22, 22:31 - Jasmine Kaur: Good day edoofian ,
Hope everything is well at your end!
I would like to share a brief message about the importance of planning in our lives and as an organization as well!
Planning is definitely significant as it directs us where to go, it furnishes direction and decreases the danger of risk by making predictions. The significant advantages of planning are provided below:
Planning provides directions: Planning assures that the objectives are certainly asserted so that they serve as a model for determining what action should be taken and in which direction. If objects are well established, employees are informed of what the company has to do and what they need do to accomplish those purposes.
Planning decreases the chances of risk: Planning is an activity which permits a manager to look forward and predict changes. By determining in prior the tasks to be completed, planning notes the way to deal with changes and unpredictable effects.
Planning decreases overlapping and wasteful activities: Planning works as the foundation of organising the activities and purposes of distinct branches, departments, and people. It assists in avoiding chaos and confusion. Since planning guarantees precision in understanding and action, work is conducted on easily without delays.
20/11/22, 08:17 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0534: Good evening sir
I understand I really have to be committed to this but I am a school student when I am online I will be doing online lessons. Can we just have a fixed timetable for the projects during the holiday.

I am in a boarding school environment .

During the school days that is Monday to Friday I can not answer the text because I will be attending my classes, we also have weekend school and at night we have Study.
I understand its a privilege that we are allowed cellphones at our school that is why I respond ,I sometimes miss my lunch trying to fix the EWYL program.

I am very sure as soon as the school term ends we can have a fixed  timetable so that I can not have to compromise the school time table.
20/11/22, 19:17 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings edoofian,
Now, please let me know what did you understand from the above text and how should we execute the same?
Which EWYL project are you currently working on and how will you use the planning function  in that?
20/11/22, 19:17 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, we will set a timetable tomorrow
20/11/22, 19:22 - Jasmine Kaur: Also, we will have a set timetable for the weekends then but Tadiwanashe I hope you understand that we need to stay connected to be updated about each other, hence we will discuss all the steps to follow

01/02/23, 05:38 - Jasmine Kaur: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

02/02/23, 00:36 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

Happy Learning!
