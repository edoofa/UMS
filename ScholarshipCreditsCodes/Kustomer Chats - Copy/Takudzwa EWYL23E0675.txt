I want you to go through these points quickly.
I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.

It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.

Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.

16/01/24, 15:49 - Ananya: For today, I have planned something special! Do you know about a resume or a CV?
16/01/24, 15:51 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0675: Yes i do
16/01/24, 15:56 - Ananya: You know, a resume is like a super important paper for students. It shows all the cool things you've done in school and outside. When you want to get into a good school or get a job, you give them your resume so they can see how awesome you are. It's like your personal advertisement that says, 'Hey, I'm really good at these things, and I can do great stuff for you!' So, having a good resume helps you stand out and get cool opportunities.
16/01/24, 15:58 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0675: Yes i have understood
16/01/24, 15:59 - Ananya: Well, yesterday I was updating my little brother's resume and took help from this video. I thought to share this with you as well, as he is suggesting some really good things!
