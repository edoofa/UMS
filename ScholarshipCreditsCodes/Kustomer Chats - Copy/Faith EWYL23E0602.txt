I hope you are doing well

'Tis the season of joy and inspiration! üéÑ‚ú® As we kick off our session, let's unwrap the motivation that Christmas brings ‚Äì a time of giving, warmth, and endless possibilities.

Here's a festive riddle to spark curiosity: What do you get if you cross a snowman and a vampire?

Excited to reveal the answer and dive into our discussion!

So, when you combine the chilly aura of a snowman with the fang-tastic presence of a vampire, you get the playfully frosty term "Frostbite." It's a fun twist that blends the elements of winter and a bit of cheeky vampire humor. Hope this brings a smile to your face! üòÑüéÑ
19/12/23, 14:04 - Unknown: *Before we move forward, I would like you to submit your response of the
Saturday activity  that was shared with you*
19/12/23, 14:05 - Faith EWYL23E0602: Oh right...
19/12/23, 14:05 - Faith EWYL23E0602: "Should I fight back or shouldn't I?" That was the question I kept asking myself as I was being strangled to death, wondering if I truly deserved such an ending.
I was just a normal girl with a normal a job, I was a secretary to some huge law firm. Everything changed when a tall well built man in a black suit walked in. Followed by eight similar looking men. I couldn't help but thinking they were his bodyguards.
I had a weird feeling about him but what could I say? After all, I was just a secretary.
After three hours, he was coming out of the elevator shouting and breaking things. I don't know where the confidence came from, but I said something to him. Shouted at him in fact.
"Hey mister! It is against the law and our policy for you to break company equipment!"
I immediately regretted my decision when he snapped his fingers and two of his men were headed toward me. Upon reaching me, they reach held me by one hand and just as I expected. My feet were off the ground.
Trying to free myself from their hold, I fidgeted and kicked in the air. Alas, they were too strong for me. I fainted after ten minutes of the struggle.
When I regained my consciousness, they came in and told me to wait for my strength to come back and I'll be leaving. Weirdly enough, their voices were affirming and I believed them.
After an hour, they were back in and set me free. I was surprised by their actions but I didn't dare say a thing.
Reaching the door, I met him, the tall well built man. 
"Don't tell me you thought I wouldn't do anything about what you said. I only wanted a fair fight, that's why I didn't kill you when you were unconscious," he said.
He immediately placed his hands on my neck and begun squeezing the life out of me.
19/12/23, 14:05 - Faith EWYL23E0602: Indeed it has
19/12/23, 14:20 - Unknown: You've crafted an intense and suspenseful story that keeps the reader hooked. Here are some suggestions to enhance your narrative:
Character Emotions: Dive deeper into the emotions of the main character. How does she feel during the confrontation and after the unexpected release? Conveying her emotions will engage the reader even more.
Dialogue Impact: The dialogue is crucial in this story. Consider adding more tension and emotion to the exchanges between the main character and the mysterious man. Make the reader feel the weight of the situation.
Setting Description: Add details about the surroundings to create a vivid picture for the reader. Describe the law firm, the atmosphere, and any relevant details that contribute to the overall atmosphere of the scene.
Pacing: Ensure a balanced pace, especially during intense moments. This will help build suspense and keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
Resolution or Cliffhanger: Consider either providing some resolution to the conflict or leaving the reader on a gripping cliffhanger. This will leave them eager for more and invested in the outcome.

Others say it's too limited as they'd like vast options... It's just quite challenging to persuade them... And for the schools...I emailed one... I'm still waiting for a response

19/12/23, 14:37 - Unknown: Great job on taking the initiative to email one school already. It's  awesome that you're actively working on the African school's education  reform mission. Now, let's keep that momentum going.

And what are the challenges?
22/12/23, 17:55 - Faith EWYL23E0602: I've made literally no progress I'm afraid... On the community building...I got in touch with as much people as I could but they just lost interest at some point...I am now working on getting in touch with people from church... The school's project is kind of at a stand still...I did get a response... But it was telling me to wait for the next term before I can get a response from the headmaster
22/12/23, 18:18 - Unknown: I understand that you're facing challenges in making progress with the community building aspect and the school project. It's not uncommon to encounter obstacles, and your determination to address them is commendable. Let's strategize on how to overcome these challenges:
Community Building:
Reassess Your Approach: Reflect on your previous interactions and identify aspects that may have led to the loss of interest. Consider if there are changes or improvements you can make to your outreach strategy.
Engaging Content: Ensure that your messages and content are engaging, informative, and aligned with the interests of the community. Highlight the benefits of the Edoofa program in a way that resonates with them.
Feedback Gathering: If people are losing interest, gather feedback on what aspects they found less appealing or engaging. Use this information to refine your communication strategy and address any concerns.
Utilize Multiple Platforms: Explore various platforms for community engagement, such as social media groups, local events, or online forums. Tailor your approach based on the preferences of the community you are targeting.
22/12/23, 18:18 - Unknown: Wrapping up this fantastic session for today‚Äîkeep soaring higher! üöÄEmbrace every step, and let your achievements be a testament to your dedication and growth. üíØ

I emphasize the importance of promptly submitting the Application forms. These aren't mere documents; they represent a pivotal step towards securing your future. Furthermore, timely updates on school project developments are crucial. Your insights serve as the linchpin for our continued progress.
22/12/23, 18:21 - Faith EWYL23E0602: So what you are saying is that I should try with the same people again using a different approach ‚ùì
22/12/23, 18:22 - Faith EWYL23E0602: "linchpin"... What do you mean by that‚ùì
22/12/23, 18:39 - Unknown: Yes, also what I mean to say is you should try to communicate with other set of people too.
22/12/23, 18:40 - Unknown: Sure! Imagine you're putting together a really cool project or building something important, like a robot or a school event. The term "lynchpin" is like the most crucial part of that project, the piece that holds everything together.
For example, if you're building a robot, the lynchpin might be the special chip that controls all the robot's movements. Without that chip, the robot won't work at all. So, the lynchpin is the part you absolutely need for everything to be successful. It's like the key ingredient that makes everything else function smoothly. In everyday terms, a lynchpin is that super important thing or person that keeps everything else running smoothly or makes everything come together.
22/12/23, 18:42 - Faith EWYL23E0602: Alright
22/12/23, 18:42 - Faith EWYL23E0602: Oh... Thanks for clearing it out for me
