09/10/23, 13:36 - Jasmine Kaur: #SA Submitted
09/10/23, 13:43 - Angel EWYL23E0669: My weekend was great. Right now I'm working on getting more interested candidates for the scholarship a few asked for time to consider and discuss with their parents. I have also just contacted the head of Thekwane High School and I'm waiting for response. I'm also hoping to contact the head of Pumula High soon as the number I have is not on WhatsApp.
09/10/23, 13:49 - Jasmine Kaur: That's excellent, Angel! Your dedication and hard work are truly impressive. Keep up the great work, Angel.
Now, let's shift our focus to one project for the maximum results i.e. African Schools Education Reform Mission. Could you please provide screenshots of the conversations you've had with the principals?
09/10/23, 13:50 - Angel EWYL23E0669: Okay
09/10/23, 13:54 - Angel EWYL23E0669: 
09/10/23, 13:54 - Angel EWYL23E0669: 
09/10/23, 13:54 - Angel EWYL23E0669: 
09/10/23, 14:00 - Jasmine Kaur: Angel, Did you reach out to the head of Pumula High School on Sunday?
09/10/23, 14:03 - Angel EWYL23E0669: No apparently that was the senior teacher so he gave me the number of the head however it's not on WhatsApp which means I will have to phone her. I was hoping to do it before the end of the week
09/10/23, 14:06 - Jasmine Kaur: Angel, I want to express my appreciation for your efforts, and I truly value your dedication. However, it's important to acknowledge that our progress has been relatively slow. To meet our objectives, it's crucial that you reach out to the headmasters consistently and secure contacts on a daily basis.
09/10/23, 14:07 - Jasmine Kaur: My ultimate goal for you is that by the time you arrive in India, you will have already accumulated a significant number of credits. Your proactive approach and consistent efforts will play a key role in achieving this goal.
09/10/23, 14:07 - Jasmine Kaur: Now, In order to perform efficiently on this projects, I would like you to tell me the names of the schools that are near your place and you can visit very easily.
09/10/23, 14:07 - Angel EWYL23E0669: Yes noted I'll try to improve my speed
09/10/23, 14:10 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, Please read my last message again Angel
09/10/23, 14:11 - Angel EWYL23E0669: There is St Bernard's, Pumula High, Sizane. Amhlophe and Magwegwe High have fees less than $100
09/10/23, 14:13 - Jasmine Kaur: I've noticed you have several options to consider. Could you please clarify if Magwegwe High School is the only one with fees under $100?
09/10/23, 14:14 - Angel EWYL23E0669: Magwegwe High and Amhlophe High are the ones with fees less than $100
09/10/23, 14:17 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, So let us first focus on St Bernard's, Pumula High, and Sizane. May I know that can you visit these schools today?
09/10/23, 14:20 - Angel EWYL23E0669: I can visit St Bernard's and Pumula High however Sizane is a little far and closes early I do not think I can make it there in time if I have to visit it after St Bernard's and Pumula
09/10/23, 14:31 - Jasmine Kaur: Today, during your visits to St. Bernard's and Pumula High, your primary objective should be to ensure that the necessary form is completed. You can approach either the headmaster or a teacher for this purpose.

Begin by introducing yourself, and then proceed to provide a comprehensive explanation about the Edoofa Scholarship program. Highlight the benefits it offers to both the school and the students.
09/10/23, 14:32 - Angel EWYL23E0669: Okay noted
09/10/23, 14:37 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, I am hoping to have a positive update from you today Angel. Now it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you. All the Best and have a great day ahead!
09/10/23, 14:38 - Angel EWYL23E0669: Thank you
09/10/23, 18:45 - Angel EWYL23E0669: I have visited St Bernard's and Pumula High. They are willing to connect with us but they want a letter from the ministry that permits me to visit schools about the Edoofa Scholarship Program so that we can make it official.

On the other hand the good news is that the head of Thekwane responded on WhatsApp I'm now about to explain to him in detail about Edoofa.
09/10/23, 18:52 - Jasmine Kaur: I'm pleased to hear that your day has been productive, Angel. Regarding the school's request for documents from the ministry, I want to clarify our primary objective. Your task was to visit the school, approach the headmaster, and inquire about their willingness to complete the required form. Once we have their consent and they understand our program's vision, we can proceed with further communication on WhatsApp. It's essential to secure their agreement before proceeding with the program.
09/10/23, 19:09 - Angel EWYL23E0669: I explained that however they told me they can't give out any details about the school unless I have that document which means that I would not be able to fill the form.
09/10/23, 19:35 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay Angel, Kindly allow me some time and I will get back to you tomorrow on this. 
Have a lovely day ahead!
09/10/23, 19:35 - Angel EWYL23E0669: Alright thank you
