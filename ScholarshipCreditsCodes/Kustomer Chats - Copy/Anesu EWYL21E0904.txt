I am a proud edoofian

16/07/22, 15:18 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

16/07/22, 15:21 - Anesu EWYL21E0904: I will continue with this habit sir because l am proud to be part of the group
16/07/22, 18:08 - Unknown: Good Morning, Proud Edoofian ?
I hope that you are in good health and spirits

We will be continuing with where we left in our scheduled session next week.
I wanted to inform you that I won't be active on the EWYL DEDICATED LINE this weekend. I have dedicated this weekend to the Edoofians who are in India. I will be getting on calls with them and checking how everything is going.

I would want you to follow the points given below:
◼️Make sure that you follow the Proud Edoofian ritual (Even on Sunday?)
◼️Keep an eye on the Saturday Activity that will be shared in your batch group
◼️Also, If you haven't submitted the Wednesday Lesson yet, Please make sure that you submit it as soon as possible.
◼️I would like to you work diligently on the EWYL Projects and submit your Project Progress Form in our next scheduled session.

I wish you a blessed and a joyful weekend ahead✨
16/07/22, 18:27 - Anesu EWYL21E0904: Ok l have noted them sir and l will try to follow that
16/07/22, 18:28 - Anesu EWYL21E0904: Thank you for informing 
I hope you will have a nice weekend
25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:07 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:33 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well.

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

This week we took a step back and reflected upon the objective of the EWYL program. We collectively reflected on why we should be regular with our projects, what these projects will help us earn, and how all of this will result in our individual financial independence.

Today, let's work on the next step which is to plan how to be financially independent by utilizing your time with the right projects. As an activity for this week, I want you to draft a document mentioning:

a)Target- no. of credits you want to earn in the month of October
b)How many projects can you work upon
c)Number of hours that you can devote to your projects
d)Name of the projects that you want to be a part of
e)Plan of action with your mentors

You are required to submit these answers by Today 6 PM. Let me know in case you face any challenges in Submitting the responses.

I hope all is well with you. 

Effective and timely feedback is a crucial part of a successful performance, as I discussed with you in our Saturday activity. Before our Session , I wanted to get in touch with you to share your EWYL report card and ask you to evaluate your performance by responding to the following questions:

1. How would you rate your performance from 1-10, 10 being the highest score?
2. What is your goal- in terms of skills and amount of scholarship credits that you want to earn?
3. What is your plan- how will you achieve the above mentioned goal?

The answers you give here will be evaluated by Ms Deepali and Ms Davi. So take you time and share your responses here in the group itself before our session.
14/12/22, 04:41 - Anesu EWYL21E0904: My performance is so bad from my judgement sir .

In today's Wednesday Wisdom, let's find out more about the secret Santa. The secret Santa has a special message for you at the end. We'll get in touch and discuss your takeaways in more detail.

18/01/23, 23:43 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

Hope you are doing well.  Time for our Wednesday wisdom, let us dive deep into the art of asking good questions. While listening is an important skill, the art of asking questions is equally, if not more, important when it comes to learning more about your work tasks, unlocking hidden opportunities, delivering better results, and mitigating unforeseen risks. Read the PDF carefully and share your learnings with me in our upcoming session. 

Happy learning!

04/02/23, 09:15 - Anesu EWYL21E0904: Well what l mean is that if one manages to be educated person then it is rare for that someone to have low life standards in that he will be capable to have any kind of job or work he or she wishes to do.
