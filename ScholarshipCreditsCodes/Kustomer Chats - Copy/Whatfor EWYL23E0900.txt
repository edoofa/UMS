I appreciate your insight on how this skill goes beyond completing assignments, emphasizing its role in unlocking our potential and gaining a deeper understanding of the world.

I agree that honing these analytical skills prepares us not only for academic challenges but also for future career opportunities. Well articulated

05/12/23, 16:25 - Whatfor EWYL23E0900: Oky
05/12/23, 16:37 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you please share your vision from the Saturday activity?
05/12/23, 16:53 - Whatfor EWYL23E0900: During my EWYL projects I managed to do one form of African school reform project where I visited the principal of Success Accademy.I managed to explain about Edoofa and the EWYL program and he understood. But the first day I visited the school I did not find him and I went back the following day and I find him.During this  journey I learned that you must be patience because they will ask you many questions and you must be ready or prepared to answer them with confidence
05/12/23, 17:45 - Saloni Rastogi: You are saying it right that this entire process requires a lot of patience!
05/12/23, 17:46 - Saloni Rastogi: But this is something we have to find different ways to approach.
05/12/23, 17:47 - Saloni Rastogi: There are two ways to work on the African School Reform project:
05/12/23, 17:47 - Saloni Rastogi: A. *Connecting with school virtually*-

‚ñ™Ô∏è In this you would have to find the contacts of the schools through your peers, friends, neighbors, cousins, school teachers, and school heads.
‚ñ™Ô∏èThen introduce yourself to them professionally and state the purpose of connecting with them along with their available time.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share information about Edoofa that I will be providing you in order to help them understand the Program deeply and with more clarity.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share the school form with them, and if they are interested in connecting with us, then our aim should be to get the form filled.
05/12/23, 17:47 - Saloni Rastogi: B. *Visiting schools physically*


‚ñ™Ô∏è Now by this, as it clearly says, you have to visit schools nearby and inform them about Edoofa.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Visiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏è With this, you will surely gain a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, overcome the fear of presenting yourself and your family Edoofa, spontaneously in front of anyone at any point.
05/12/23, 18:43 - Saloni Rastogi: I can feel the excitement building up because tomorrow's Wednesday lesson is going to be nothing short of amazing! Get ready for an engaging and thrilling experience that you won't want to miss.
05/12/23, 19:53 - Whatfor EWYL23E0900: Thank you
06/12/23, 16:20 - Saloni Rastogi: *_Happy Wednesday, Proud Edoofian!_*

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Wednesday lesson is going to be particularly valuable for you as we delve into the major importance of using Excel sheets and explore a few basic formulas that will be immensely beneficial for your academic journey.

In today's lesson, we will highlight how Excel can serve as an indispensable tool for students. From organizing your academic life to enhancing your analytical skills, Excel offers a range of features that can significantly impact your efficiency and productivity.

Looking forward to an engaging session!

12/12/23, 15:59 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!
