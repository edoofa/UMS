I hope you are doing well

I have noticed you joined the scheduled session late and then you were available after the session timing was over. Please understand that it is crucial to join the sessions on time
Think of joining class sessions on time like catching a movie or a fun show. If you arrive late, you might miss the exciting beginning, and it can be tricky to catch up. Being on time for class means you get to see and learn everything from the start, just like watching a movie from the beginning to enjoy the whole story.
20/09/23, 09:49 - Collin EWYL23E0379: Ok it was network problem
20/09/23, 13:49 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian Collin, Hope you are doing well!

Today's lesson is an exciting one as we delve into the world of freelancing and explore how it can benefit each one of you.

Freelancing, in its essence, offers you the opportunity to work independently, unleashing your creativity, and harnessing your unique skills and talents. Get ready to explore the world of freelancing, unlock your potential, and discover how it can benefit you as student and aspiring professional. I look forward to our engaging discussion once you have read the lesson in our upcoming session.

Happy Learning!
