I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.
12/10/23, 13:09 - Sydwell EWYL23E0739: Duly noted, thank you
12/10/23, 13:19 - Ananya: You know, I came across a video that my professor shared when I was a student, during our examinations. While thinking about your session this morning, it occurred to me that I should share this with my students as well
12/10/23, 13:43 - Sydwell EWYL23E0739: Waiting for the video

13/10/23, 12:21 - Sydwell EWYL23E0739: OK thank you, in order to succeed as an entrepreneur, you have to learn certain skills. Communication involves the sender, and encoding (checking format to use when sending). Building a career its a team work so you have to be network diverse.
13/10/23, 12:21 - Sydwell EWYL23E0739: What are those skills??

I hope you had a productive week and enjoyed our lesson on Wednesday.

As part of our ongoing commitment to personal growth and self-improvement, I'd like you to take a moment to reflect on the key takeaways from the lesson. Identify one specific goal you want to achieve based on our discussions. Be sure to make it SMART. Lastly, identify one significant distraction that you are willing to remove or reduce to bolster your focus and productivity.

Let's reconvene next week to discuss our progress, share our experiences, and support each other in our personal development journeys. I look forward to hearing from you and working together to achieve our goals.

Best regards,

19/10/23, 12:55 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to let you know that today's Wednesday lesson is going to be a special one. We'll be delving into a captivating story that revolves around the themes of skill, hard work, and determination.

The moral of this story is a powerful one, and it's a lesson that we can carry with us throughout our lives: "Sometimes the truest treasures lay not in the allure of gold but in the craftsmanship and effort one invests in their work." This story will remind us of the value of dedication and the importance of striving for excellence in everything we do.

So, come prepared to listen, learn, and be inspired by this tale of determination and the rewards it can bring. We'll discuss the story, its characters, and the valuable lesson it imparts.

See you in our upcoming session, and let's explore the world of skill, hard work, and the true treasures that lie within our reach.

Best regards,
Team EWYL!

19/10/23, 13:54 - Sydwell EWYL23E0739: There was a boy in the place called Capfuce, his name was Kumashela. In Year 2022 Kumashela decided to do broiler from his first salary. His father told him that he should quit that project and buy one cow so that after a fews years it can multiply. Kumashela explained to his father that he would like to do broiler farming first. After 4 months and hard working he bought a cow from profits of broiler project and continued with his broiler farming. Now he has many cattle and his life is now stable because of hardworking and believing in himself.
19/10/23, 13:57 - Ananya: Lovely,It's a great example of how someone's dedication and belief in their own goals and decisions can lead to success.

26/10/23, 13:14 - Ananya: Greetings, Sydwell,

You do not have to share this message every time we have our session. How are you today?
26/10/23, 13:19 - Sydwell EWYL23E0739: I'm good and how are you
26/10/23, 13:28 - Ananya: You know, recently we had a meeting with Angad Sir, and as a whole team, we were planning to introduce some external projects! I'm sharing this information with my students early because these external projects will be considered as valuable experience when they pursue their future dream jobs!
These projects will only be offered to students who have excelled in the EWYL journey and previous projects, as they demonstrate dedication and consistency. So, I think it's essential for us to start preparing as soon as possible. Together, we will brainstorm creative ways to maintain our positive reputation and excellent record. What are your thoughts on this?
26/10/23, 13:31 - Sydwell EWYL23E0739: I think this will help me a lot because I'm an individual who is eager to learn new skills. This is so interesting
26/10/23, 13:32 - Ananya: Indeed, last year when students came to India, only well-performing students were offered some amazing projects and had the opportunity to work with renowned brands like Sirona!
Therefore, I want you to be proactive and consistent with your EWYL projects so that you can uphold your reputation in the EWYL department. This way, when an external project comes up, your name will immediately come to mind as a top candidate. Keep up the hard work, and you'll create more opportunities for yourself in the future!
26/10/23, 13:33 - Sydwell EWYL23E0739: I thank you for such an encouraging response
