03/10/22, 21:59 - Unknown: Hello, my dear Proud Edoofians,

This week we took a step back and reflected upon the objective of the EWYL program. We collectively reflected on why we should be regular with our projects, what these projects will help us earn, and how all of this will result in our individual financial independence.

Today, let's work on the next step which is to plan how to be financially independent by utilizing your time with the right projects. As an activity for this week, I want you to draft a document mentioning:

a)Target- no. of credits you want to earn in the month of October
b)How many projects can you work upon
c)Number of hours that you can devote to your projects
d)Name of the projects that you want to be a part of
e)Plan of action with your mentors

You are required to submit these answers by 3rd October 2022. Let me know in case you face any challenges in Submitting the responses.
03/10/22, 22:39 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: And madam, this is the Saturday task

06/10/22, 19:35 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians,

So we know, a lot of you have been keeping busy these days with your exams and academic curriculum. And while we wish you all the luck for it, we don't want you to miss out on your learning and skill building. In today's lesson, we will discuss how to build our capacity to multitask, manage our time and prioritize our daily tasks in order to have it all. 

Let's dig right in, and understand how if you follow these steps, you will be able to manage your exams, assignments, extra curriculars, and your EWYL projects all at one go. After going through this, you must discuss the plan of action to execute these steps with your mentors.

Happy Learning!
06/10/22, 19:37 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: Okay madam, thank you
06/10/22, 19:47 - Unknown: It is on multitasking as a lot of students have their examinations these days hence,  we though that you guys must be knowing how to manage your tasks accordingly.
06/10/22, 19:55 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: Thank you, and that's very helpful because balancing the time for exams and that of the EWYL tasks is rather impossible. 
But since you had prepared some tips, we are grateful.
06/10/22, 20:17 - Unknown: There was an important festival yesterday named Dussehra

Dussehra marks the end of navratri celebrations. The nine day long Hindu festival of worshiping the feminine energy Shakti comes to an end with Dussehra. This year, Dussehra will be celebrated in India on October 5.
Also known as Vijaya Dashami, this day signifies the victory of good over evil.
06/10/22, 20:45 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: Thank you, I was told that yesterday was a holiday. 
Some stores were closed for the day and classes also. 
But didn't know the Holiday's name. 
So it was Dussehra.
06/10/22, 23:31 - Unknown: Yes
06/10/22, 23:31 - Unknown: Right

07/10/22, 20:34 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: Afternoon madam
07/10/22, 20:34 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: I've gone through the newsletter
07/10/22, 20:35 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

08/10/22, 19:13 - Unknown: *Check this out, this is the response I received by one of my students and I am expecting the same out of you*


What I have learnt so far is that there are steps that will help me in managing my exams, assignment, extracurricular and ewyl projects at one go.the first step is to set a vision and it gives me a mind of finding a practical use for my time efficiently.always remembering the bigger picture and spending time on things that move closer to my vision. Secondly is to create a masterlist daily where I will be listing tasks to be done on that particular day and it gives me a picture of what my day is going to look like and remembering all that needed to be done. Thirdly is to find my productive cycle by finding the time of the day when I have a huge amount of focus and energy and start executing the most important task . Lastly is leveraging people, I have to delegate my tasks and make best use of resources available and it helps me increase my work efficiency. I have to believe in others vision and support them to interchange and help me
08/10/22, 19:17 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: Yes madam, I understand and I will do so. 
Thank you
08/10/22, 20:05 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: In this weeks Wednesday wisdom, I learnt of Time Management. That time is an essential, we as students need to prioritize it, cherish it because it sets our vision in motion.As we everyday are exposed to different situations we are learning and engaging ourselves in different activities inorder to shape our future.

But in order to shape our future, we got to plan our time correctly as time is our life. 

1) Setting a vision: Having a vision gives us a sense of
utilizing our time efficiently. Always remember the bigger
picture, and always spend time on things that move you
closer to your vision.
2) Create a Masterlist daily: A master list is a list of tasks
to be done on that particular day. It gives one a picture of
what the day is going to look like and helps to
remember all that’s needed to be done.
3) Find my productive Cycle: This means finding the time
of the day where I have the maximum amount of focus
and energy.  
4) Leverage People: Here I have to believe in others’ vision and
support them for them to reciprocate and help me in the future. 
Delegating my tasks, and utilising resources available can
help me increase my work efficiency.
08/10/22, 20:11 - Unknown: I am happy with your understanding edoofian,
Now, I want you to apply this in the weekend task
08/10/22, 20:14 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: Yes madam, thank you. 
I'm sure I will apply it ?. 
I'm looking forward to it
08/10/22, 20:38 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!

11/10/22, 00:29 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: With that I'm not sure but I think maybe 5 students a week would do
11/10/22, 20:02 - Unknown: Okay so let us set the target 5 for this week
11/10/22, 20:02 - Unknown: Abigail, can you frame what you have learned from the webinars conducted so far so that we can get a constructive feedback through a paragraph?
11/10/22, 21:03 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: Yes madam, I'll try because I really want to achieve at these projects
11/10/22, 21:42 - Unknown: Okay and what about the schools?
11/10/22, 22:05 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: Yes madam and that too. 
I will try with the school project.
11/10/22, 22:16 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: This is the project whereby I have got to link up with the headmaster or principal of the school to partner with Edoofa
11/10/22, 22:25 - Unknown: Yes , so how many schools do you think you can reach?
What target should I set?
11/10/22, 23:35 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: I'm sure about that madam, maybe one school a week. I could manage
12/10/22, 00:15 - Unknown: Yes , let us set the target as 1 school per week
12/10/22, 00:15 - Unknown: That would be fine for the start
12/10/22, 17:21 - Unknown: Greetings for the day edoofian,
I hope you are good!
12/10/22, 17:31 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: Greetings madam, how are you doing.
12/10/22, 17:31 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: I am a proud Efoofian
12/10/22, 17:42 - Unknown: I am doing fine
12/10/22, 17:42 - Unknown: Edoofian, I have another strategy for you for *COMMUNITY BUILDING*

You can approach 1 student , ask for his\/her time [ when he\/she will be available to have a conversation ]

After that you can pitch edoofa and use the edoofa FAQ 


Once you are over with that conversation , you can ask the student to add you in his\/her school unofficial group and then counsel them all together.
12/10/22, 18:14 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: Okay madam, that would be a great idea, it might work. 
And now about the Edoofa FAQ, I will approach you once  I've been able to score with a good conversation with that student
12/10/22, 18:55 - Unknown: You can send the form in that group and ask the student to fill it.
Once you get the forms you can submit them to me.

If you want any help with the communication, I can help you with that
12/10/22, 19:01 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: Okay madam, thank you very much. 
I will surely do that.
12/10/22, 21:05 - Unknown: Can you repeat what you have to do?
So that we are on the same page?
12/10/22, 21:39 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: Yes,madam.
You had said you got a strategy for me that I could use for the Community Building Project. 
And that is approaching a student ask for his or her time and pitch to her about Edoofa and use the Edoofa FAQ. 
Once we are done with the conversation I can ask the student to add me in their unofficial school group and then counsel them together. 
And send the form in the group and once they fill it I will submit them back to you. 
And also if I want help with communication, you will help me with it.
12/10/22, 22:30 - Unknown: Right
12/10/22, 22:30 - Unknown: So now you can use this edoofian
12/10/22, 22:31 - Unknown: Let us discuss, how you will reach out to schools
12/10/22, 22:31 - Unknown: What communication will you use
12/10/22, 22:31 - Unknown: So, This is what the First message should look like:

Greetings Mr.\/Mrs *School Head Name*

I am *Your Name* and I am a student of _Your School Name_ school.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result\/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
12/10/22, 22:35 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: Yes?
12/10/22, 22:38 - Unknown: Once He\/She confirms the timings with you, Please make sure that you reach out to the School Head 5 min before the scheduled timings. After that, you can start sharing the information regarding Edoofa with him\/her.
This is what the Introduction will look like:


Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education   All. 

Edoofa is a social for-profit organization that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!

Sir,\/Mam, Do you know that ABC School (I will be providing you with the name of this school) which is in our province is a proud partner of Edoofa?
12/10/22, 22:42 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: Yes madam, I will do so?
12/10/22, 23:08 - Unknown: Sir,\/Mam, Do you know that ABC School (I will be providing you with the name of this school) which is in our province is a proud partner of Edoofa?

Over the past 2 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his\/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as a company wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. With the quality of education provided to the student completing high school, edoofa would want to transform your school’s every student into a person who’s so strong in the knowledge that he\/she becomes better than her peers. Coupled with the Earn While you Learn program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he\/she has got more opportunities to chase him\/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development\/growth.
12/10/22, 23:16 - Unknown: By Sharing the above information, We have completed the Introduction part. Now, It is time to explain with examples How Edoofa is revolutionizing the Education System on the African Continent. Examples create clarity. This is why they are used in all contexts as a tool to provide further understanding. When it comes to your conversation, examples play a significant role in your ability to effectively communicate the elements that you want the School Head to understand.
12/10/22, 23:41 - Abigail EWYL21E0843: Yes, madam I completely understand. 
I will try this strategy to get to the school principals
13/10/22, 00:46 - Unknown: Sir\/ Mam, I would like to share some examples regarding How Edoofa is revolutionizing the Education System in the African Continent.

Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *90 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

Thank you
13/10/22, 01:02 - Unknown: Okay , now I want you to achieve the target

Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
