16/11/22, 19:04 - Aditi Kapoor: A very good morning Kundai!
16/11/22, 19:04 - Aditi Kapoor: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Line. Here we practice a 'mantra' where you should always start and end the day by saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' to boost your energy!
16/11/22, 20:40 - Kundai EWYL22E0828: Greetings, Mr Maurice. l am doing good sir
16/11/22, 20:41 - Kundai EWYL22E0828: I am a proud Edoofian
16/11/22, 20:42 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

16/11/22, 21:12 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Kundai! It is my pleasure to connect with you here at the *EWYL Line*
16/11/22, 21:13 - Aditi Kapoor: As discussed before, I will be sharing the *Wednesday lesson* with you today and we shall discuss about it on Friday as scheduled!
16/11/22, 21:48 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello, my dear proud Edoofian. I hope all is well with you.

Another insightful Wednesday Wisdom is presented here. The lesson today teaches us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, disability. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition. A few questions near the end of the session will ask you to reflect and have an open dialogue with yourself. After you finish your lesson, as your mentor, I'd like to have a thorough conversation about your key take aways, in our upcoming sessions.

Enjoy the article and keep in mind that success does not come to you suddenly; rather, it can be attained over time by making modest, daily improvements.

Happy learning!
16/11/22, 22:12 - Kundai EWYL22E0828: Thank you sir

16/11/22, 22:37 - Kundai EWYL22E0828: Thank you sir
16/11/22, 22:40 - Aditi Kapoor: Sure! take your time and we will discuss about it thoroughly in the session on Thursday (tomorrow) on 12-1PM
16/11/22, 22:46 - Kundai EWYL22E0828: Ok sir l have gone through it
16/11/22, 23:08 - Aditi Kapoor: Can you quickly recall what you have learnt? How did Mr. Eddie influence you?
17/11/22, 00:06 - Kundai EWYL22E0828: Mr Eddie did not give up in what he was doing no matter  what the doctors said,  No matter the challenges he faced .He showed perseverance till he meet his goals .
17/11/22, 00:07 - Aditi Kapoor: Awesome Kundai! Did he inspire you?
17/11/22, 00:08 - Kundai EWYL22E0828: Yes he did sir
17/11/22, 00:10 - Kundai EWYL22E0828: He never gave up
17/11/22, 00:14 - Aditi Kapoor: That is exactly what we will imbibe in ourselves! We should not give up! Let me share a response I have received from one of my students: 
\"Okay sir and thanks I have finished listening to the audio and I must say I'm really touched and it's true disability is a less talked matter but now I have listened to this and it's really shocking that though Eddie is disabled he has achieved so much and why can't I. I mean I have everything and I can do anything so what is stopping me. I also have realized that you just don't wake up successful but you have to dream and stay positive and keep pushing until you have what you want and the other thing I learnt is that if you fail you don't give up or if your dreams are shuttered you have to continue dreaming in that way you can succeed\"
17/11/22, 00:26 - Kundai EWYL22E0828: Yes it's true sir we don't just wake up successful we have to work for it thank you for sharing that response
17/11/22, 01:45 - Aditi Kapoor: Thanks for attending the session today, I had an awesome time interacting with you!
