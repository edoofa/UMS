18/05/23, 00:13 - Tinashe EWYL22E1206: Great leaders have emerged with particular leadership styles in providing direction, implementing plans, and motivating people. 
Firstly i learnt the types of leadership style which are (1) Servant leadership. Servant leadership is the type of leadership philosophy in which the goal of the leader is to serve. Servant leader shares power puts the needs of the employees first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible. Instead of the people working to serve the leader, the leader exists to serve the people..
 2) Traditional leadership which is type of leadership where the leader's main focus is the thriving of their company or organization.  
I also learnt about the important characteristics which are listening, healing, empathy, awareness etc

Entrepreneurship has always been part of his DNA from a tender age, spurred by life challenges his family experienced, which drove him to start his own thriving businesses. To me this means she worked very hard to archive and to persue her dreams to be come an entrepreneur..
I have identified some similarities such as Working hard to achive your goals, innovative thinking, no giving up and always learning.. 
i also discovered some dissimilarities that we have is that at times we as individuals we are afraid to take risk while entrepreneurs do take risk
19/06/23, 18:37 - Ananya: That's good that you have noticed a notable difference between individuals and entrepreneurs in terms of risk-taking. While some individuals may be hesitant to take risks, entrepreneurs often embrace risk as a necessary part of their journey.

19/06/23, 19:10 - Tinashe EWYL22E1206: The first Question says *How can we harness the power of incremental improvements and connections between existing ideas to drive creative progress and innovation* .. on my point of view the changes can be implemented quickly. The change can be dissected into smaller changes allowing us to focus on improvements that can be implemented in the necessary timeframe.
Also if there is need for changes are done quickly and less risky. It is also easier

We hope this message finds you well in your academic pursuits. We are excited to share a Saturday activity centered around learning from influential personalities. Our chosen figure is Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of Liberia and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Through her remarkable leadership and unwavering determination, she has left an indelible mark on history. Let's draw valuable lessons from her life for our personal development.

Two traits that stand out about Ellen Johnson Sirleaf are resilience and visionary leadership. These qualities can greatly contribute to our growth and development as individuals. They can positively impact our academic pursuits, relationships, and future career goals.

To develop resilience, we can learn from Sirleaf's ability to bounce back from challenges. We can seek out difficult experiences and learn from them, cultivating a mindset of perseverance and adaptability.

Here are some suggestions to help you get started:

Identify two traits: Reflect on Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's qualities that resonate with you.

Reflect on personal development: Consider how these traits can positively impact your academic pursuits, relationships, or future career goals.

Create an action plan: Outline practical steps like seeking mentorship, practicing self-discipline, engaging in community service, or pursuing relevant courses and extracurricular activities.
Let's embark on this exciting journey together and make Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's legacy an integral part of our own lives.
Best regards,

Comment if you have been working on the community building project and how many aspiring Edoofians have enrolled through you!
28/06/23, 21:30 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!
