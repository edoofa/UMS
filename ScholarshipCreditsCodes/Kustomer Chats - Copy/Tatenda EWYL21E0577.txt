I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

26/06/23, 16:32 - Tenzin: Hello Edoofian,
We hope this message finds you well in your academic pursuits. We are excited to share a Saturday activity centered around learning from influential personalities. Our chosen figure is Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of Liberia and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Through her remarkable leadership and unwavering determination, she has left an indelible mark on history. Let's draw valuable lessons from her life for our personal development.

Two traits that stand out about Ellen Johnson Sirleaf are resilience and visionary leadership. These qualities can greatly contribute to our growth and development as individuals. They can positively impact our academic pursuits, relationships, and future career goals.

To develop resilience, we can learn from Sirleaf's ability to bounce back from challenges. We can seek out difficult experiences and learn from them, cultivating a mindset of perseverance and adaptability.

Here are some suggestions to help you get started:

Identify two traits: Reflect on Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's qualities that resonate with you.

Reflect on personal development: Consider how these traits can positively impact your academic pursuits, relationships, or future career goals.

Create an action plan: Outline practical steps like seeking mentorship, practicing self-discipline, engaging in community service, or pursuing relevant courses and extracurricular activities.
Let's embark on this exciting journey together and make Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's legacy an integral part of our own lives.
Best regards,

Team Edoofa

27/10/22, 00:29 - Unknown: Hello, My Dear Proud Edoofian.

We all know that \"History is Written by Winners\", but not everybody knows the discipline, dedication, sacrifices, time, and efforts put behind it.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the kind of mindset a winner possesses, and about the person who carved his way from the bottom to the top, and even beyond. The story of a basketball player turning into a lethal black mamba on the court, the habits he formed, and the mindset he forged, to turn into a winner, is inspirational and the most practical way to better oneself every single day. You will learn a lot of different things from this lesson, about the attitude, instinct, and character of a true all-round winner.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

‚ÄúMy job is not to be easy on people. My job is to make them better.‚Äù- Steve Jobs

And till now, our founder Mr. Angad has always been a guiding light for everyone at Edoofa. And has made sure we all turn out to be future leaders in our fields, no matter how hard it seems, we should keep moving with single harmony toward our goals and motives. But, leadership can not only be taught, as it is not a literary subject, but a practical life experience that is to be taken up and practiced and bettered with each passing day.

Hence, after the very encouraging Wednesday lesson on how good leadership and patience can change the entire ideology and perception of a community to grow back from the ashes. Today's Activity is going to give you a first-hand experience to fit yourselves in a small part of the leadership shoes. I want you to create a newsletter of your own. Similar to the ones you have enjoyed reading every Sunday from the founder's office.

Your Newsletter should consider the following things:  Quotes that have been motivating you for some time now, or your three favorite quotes which motivate you to be better every day.
and,
2. One story of your idol, that can be any person, who according to you has contributed to making the community and world a better place for people to live. The story should also consist of a part stating the reason why they are your idol.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own capabilities while performing this activity.

The best newsletters of the week shall be shared with all the fellow edoofians next week.

Have a wonderful weekend ahead.
05/11/22, 22:11 - Unknown: The deadline for the submission of this newsletter is 12 pm Zimbabwe Time Monday.
13/11/22, 00:33 - Unknown: Greetings My Dear Proud Edoofian!

\"Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.\" ~ Bruce Lee

In this week's Wednesday lesson, you learned about the different sorts of personalities a person carries, but only a true leader is one who understands their personality and can do wonders with its power. In today's activity, I want you to dig deeper into your own consciousness and learn more about the kind of personality you are. As I believe, the more you know yourself, the clearer your vision of the world and your mind gets. Below is a link to a personality test, which you shall be taking up this week, and then would be sharing the results via a screenshot to your mentors by Monday. You can then read and understand more about your results by discussing them with your Mentor.

This particular exercise is going to give you an insight into the kind of person you are so that you can use your strengths to yield the maximum benefits in whatever work you take up.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own personality while performing this activity.

Have a wonderful weekend ahead.

Deadline -  Monday.
