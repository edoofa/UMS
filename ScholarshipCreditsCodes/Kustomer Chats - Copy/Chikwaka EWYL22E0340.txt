How's your day going?
09/08/22, 22:51 - Saloni Rastogi: One can be called successful if they have achieved their desired goals. For some people, being successful means being rich. But being successful is even more than being rich. When you achieve what you want, it gives you immense pleasure, and that is incomparable with being rich. To be successful in any aspect of life, one needs to have strong dedication and work hard. 
Our WEEKEND ACTIVITY discussed the traits of a successful person.
So, in our session today, we will:
1. discuss your understanding of the weekend activity.
2. make weekly plans on achieving targets on three ongoing projects.
11/08/22, 00:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Chikwaka!

20/08/22, 22:30 - Saloni Rastogi: I would like to share something with you. For all my students I am maintaining a personal report card so that each week I am able to give them a reflection on how they have performed, how many sessions have they attended, and how many responses have they submitted.
Please have a look at it, go through it, and share with me what can be done about it and how should we proceed.
I hope I am clear.
I am always there for all kind of help, but yes, we really need to work on this.

The weekend activity was something different this time. It did not talk about any other person but rather it was a self-introspection for ourselves, identifying and realizing our strong and weak points.
I am very excited to discuss them, what can be done about the, how are you working on them, and what could be the best possible solution.
So the aim of today's session on the EWYL Line is:
1. sharing your views on weekend activity 
2. important discussion on the community building project.

How are you?
20/10/22, 21:11 - Saloni Rastogi: I am happy to tell you that this weekend we are having our great Indian festival, Deepawali and you know this festival holds a special place in the hearts of all Indian families. So yesterday, everyone in our office wore Ethnic dresses and celebrate Deepawali's party where we exchanged gifts and lit up the office with diyas and candles.
Due to this, there was a delay in sending you the Wednesday lesson for this week.
Please see to it and we will have a session tomorrow on the same because I want to give you time to ponder and work on it.
20/10/22, 21:12 - Saloni Rastogi: In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.
20/10/22, 22:16 - Chikwaka EWYL22E0340: Oky

29/08/23, 18:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Chikwaka!

29/08/23, 18:26 - Saloni Rastogi: I am glad to find you here and I wish to continue our sessions with you.
29/08/23, 18:28 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
29/08/23, 18:28 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - “I am a proud Edoofian”
29/08/23, 18:28 - Saloni Rastogi: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter

3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.


If you are ready then we can begin🎉
29/08/23, 18:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *09:30-11:00 AM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.

Hope you are doing well, I would like to announce that today is a holiday on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan which is an auspicious Indian Festival so I am sharing the lesson with you today!

So for this week's Wednesday lesson,  I have an exciting topic to delve into: Hidden Talent.
We'll dive into the captivating story of Samuel, a character whose seemingly ordinary life takes a fascinating turn when his secret talent comes to light. Through his story, we'll discover the power of talents that lie beneath the surface, waiting for the perfect moment to shine.
So, bring your curiosity and imagination as we delve into Samuel's tale and discuss the significance of hidden talents in our own lives. You might even find yourself reflecting on your own unique abilities that are yet to be revealed.

In our upcoming session I would like to know if you have a hidden talent that you're particularly good at or passionate about? It could be anything – from artistic pursuits to something more unexpected.

Get ready to be inspired, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together!

I wanted to express how genuinely intrigued and excited I am after our Wednesday lesson. It was not just interesting but also incredibly amusing. As I delved into the material, I couldn't help but ponder my own hidden talents and how I might use them to bring smiles and magic into the lives of others. It's a thought that has been lingering in my mind ever since.

Now, I'm very curious about your talents, those unique gifts that undoubtedly define who you are. I'm eagerly anticipating hearing about them because I'm sure they're something special.

Afterward, let's also dive into the exciting world of projects!
