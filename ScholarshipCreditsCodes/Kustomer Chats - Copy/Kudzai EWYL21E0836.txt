02/08/22, 05:00 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: Good evening
02/08/22, 05:00 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: It's Kudzai Tholana this is my new number
02/08/22, 21:06 - Unknown: Good afternoon Kudzai!
02/08/22, 23:17 - Unknown: A timetable is a framework that lets individuals see specific activities lined up. In this framework, it shows the tie allotment among several tasks and courses. It ensures equal distribution of time among activities and subjects, creates a smooth workflow, prevents wasting of time and efforts, and aids in creating good habits.
The *weekend activity* asked you to draw a timetable for yourself and of course, have time for your scheduled sessions as well.
I am really excited to see your timetable on the EWYL Line and of course, we can discuss how we can manage our sessions accordingly.
In this session today, we will discuss:
1. your timetable (as a part of the weekend activity)
2. progress on community building projects
02/08/22, 23:18 - Unknown: I am sharing the weekend activity with you. I am sure you will work on this.
02/08/22, 23:19 - Unknown: A well-constructed timetable establishes a natural rhythm and routine, which can be comforting students as well as their mentors. Having a plan as a learner is very important as it helps you maximize and prioritize on the things that are of urgency or importance. Most students do not have an organized study plan and if they do, they fail to follow the plan drawn. As the Wednesday Wisdom offered advice on how to use our time wisely. You must share your daily schedules with your mentors as part of your Saturday activity in the format that has been provided to you. I've given you the image of a timetable; you can draw it on paper and show it to your mentors. Do not forget to provide the scheduled time for your EWYL programme.
03/08/22, 00:53 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: Good afternoon Madam
03/08/22, 00:53 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: Noted Madam
03/08/22, 23:12 - Unknown: Greetings Kudzai!

11/08/22, 00:26 - Unknown: Greetings Kudzai!
Due to some medical emergency, I would not be able to take your session today.
But, nothing to worry about, I will do better after some time.
And by the time we have our next scheduled session, I want you to keep following the proud edoofian ritual.
Till then, have a great day.
And yes, we have our cultural festival tomorrow, named Raksha Bandhan. I want you to search for it, and if it gains your interest, we will surely discuss it in our next session.
17/08/22, 12:25 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: Helloe madam
18/08/22, 02:22 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: Hello Madam
18/08/22, 08:33 - Unknown: Greetings Kudzai!
How are you?
18/08/22, 08:47 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: I am great Madam how are you
18/08/22, 08:53 - Unknown: I know very well that our sessions have not taken place properly in the past few days but I promise and I assure you that now things and everything will take place in full swing.
18/08/22, 08:53 - Unknown: I am doing great, thanks for asking.
18/08/22, 11:18 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: Sure madam
18/08/22, 11:18 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: Wanted to ask did you get in contact with the above pupils?
13/07/22, 01:09 - Unknown: I am really glad to hear your understanding of the activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY* . They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost up, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.
13/07/22, 01:17 - Unknown: Along with this brilliant I saw one thing that you have not submitted your response to the Wednesday lesson, may I know why?
In case you are facing any issue, please let me know.
16/07/22, 01:34 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: I am a proud Edoofian
16/07/22, 01:34 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: Good evening Madam
16/07/22, 01:35 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
16/07/22, 01:36 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: Thank you ☺️

16/07/22, 19:48 - Unknown: You know Kudzai I was wondering that since you are so passionate to become Edoofian of the week and featuring in the Edoofian Hall of fame, I know what you can do to become that. You already know it, it needs to be highligjted.
16/07/22, 19:50 - Unknown: I am talking about the three ongoing projects that we have.
16/07/22, 19:51 - Unknown: Can we discuss today on them?
16/07/22, 22:31 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: Yes Madam we can discuss them

17/07/22, 04:08 - Unknown: Oh, I see Kudzai.
17/07/22, 04:11 - Unknown: Are you aware of the three projects that are an integral part of the EWYL Program?

19/07/22, 22:29 - Unknown: Hello my proud EDOOFIAN!
I hope you are doing well.
SWOT analysis might sound something complex but I am sure that while going through our weekend activity, you might have gone through what a SWOT means thoroughly and gained much knowledge on the same. The weekend activity asked us to draw a SWOT analysis of any company.
I want to share your response with me here Kudzai.
20/07/22, 16:57 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Kudzai!
How did your day go?
20/07/22, 17:07 - Unknown: I see you have seen my message but chose not to respond, may I know why?
Kudzai I know you are a bright kid and have so many capabilities to do wonders. You have been performing well previously and I know you will keep on performing well in the coming sessions as well. Do you know what is the basic aim of these activities and lessons? To polish your strengths and strong points, make you realize that you have the full potential to outshine other kids. In case you have any doubt or difficulty in understanding the activity, you can always reach out to me, you know that. 
Please Kudzai, make use of each of these sessions to your fullest and keep the participation active as much as possible because if I keep on making efforts and I do not see efforts coming from your side then the purpose of these sessions won't get justified.
20/07/22, 17:46 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: True that Madam I apologize for the inconvenience caused. Today I am available but I am traveling to Harare for a visa collection. So I will be hardly responding.

Thank you for noticing my good potential Madam I will thrive to excel in whatever task I will receive

22/07/22, 04:13 - Unknown: Good that you informed me about your plans for the visa process, I appreciate that Kudzai.

22/07/22, 23:08 - Unknown: That is amazing Kudzai that your visa process is complete now, I am glad to hear that.
I am sure that now you will be able to work on your activities and lessons in full swing.
22/07/22, 23:10 - Unknown: Along with this, let's move on with our session.
Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our WEDNESDAY Wisdom was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
3. your pending response to the weekend activity
23/07/22, 01:24 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: I learned that successful people don't blame others they blame their actions for not making. In order for one to make it in life one needs to accept and take responsibility. Not like a sailor who blamed the sea instead of the wind

Also successful people learn from their mistakes. They don't quit when they make mistakes instead they get the courage to keep on trying as quiting is one of the biggest mistake
23/07/22, 01:38 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: So in oder for one to be successful we app need to accept that mistakes should not let us down. We should learn from them not quiting.
23/07/22, 01:39 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: 2.On the projects I am a bit behind Madam can you help me to catch up on it
23/07/22, 01:39 - Kudzai EWYL21E0836: I am now preparing my pending response for my weekend activity
23/07/22, 02:44 - Unknown: I read your response Kudzai and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful: hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like, not what others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
23/07/22, 02:45 - Unknown: So as for project two, I would like to brief you on the same.
23/07/22, 02:49 - Unknown: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off
