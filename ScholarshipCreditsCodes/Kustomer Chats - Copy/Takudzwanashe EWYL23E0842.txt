Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

13/12/23, 16:40 - Aditi Kapoor: *Happy Wednesday*🌻

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Hope you are doing well.
Let's dive into today's session🚀
14/12/23, 13:23 - Takudzwanashe EWYL23E0842: Yes and I'm ready
14/12/23, 13:28 - Aditi Kapoor: Excellent, let's kick off the session with your understanding of the Wednesday Lesson.
14/12/23, 13:40 - Takudzwanashe EWYL23E0842: Okay,thank you.
So l learnt about two virtues the virtue of Honesty and virtue of hard work.so the virtue of Honesty is all about being honest and knowing your strengths and weaknesses .Being honesty results in creating an environment of trust amongst one's peers and also creates an environment to open communication and the virtue of hard work is all about putting effort as well as setting goals . Further learning also plays a big role in hard working as it provides more space for one to develop critical thinking skills and problem solving abilities as well as reaching out to additional information and resources thus providing a deeper and clearer understanding of the situations.However hard work enforces discipline, resilience and determination to students.
14/12/23, 13:43 - Aditi Kapoor: Thank you for sharing your insights! It's great that you've learned about the virtues of honesty and hard work. Honesty, involving self-awareness of strengths and weaknesses, not only builds trust among peers but also fosters open communication. On the other hand, the virtue of hard work encompasses putting in effort, setting goals, and emphasizes the importance of continuous learning. Hard work not only enhances critical thinking and problem-solving skills but also encourages students to seek additional information, fostering a deeper understanding of various situations.
14/12/23, 13:47 - Takudzwanashe EWYL23E0842: Thank you
14/12/23, 14:15 - Takudzwanashe EWYL23E0842: The projects are going well still no connection with my school head.

14/12/23, 14:31 - Takudzwanashe EWYL23E0842: He just replied he's very busy and l asked when will he be available but there was no reply to that
14/12/23, 14:33 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, in this case, try reaching out to other schools and focus on the community-building project as these little hurdles shouldn't stop you from going towards your aim.
14/12/23, 14:34 - Takudzwanashe EWYL23E0842: Okay thank you

17/12/23, 16:32 - Takudzwanashe EWYL23E0842: Growing up ,l always struggled with feeling that l wasn't good enough .l would often compare myself to others students and feel like l didn't measure up because my grades in class were not as good as theirs.But then, one day l found myself in situation whereby my friends encouraged me to cheat in my exams so that l can get good grades as theirs.At first l didn't feel comfortable with the idea of cheating and when l did cheat for the first time l got good grades. l felt like this was good because it helped me eliminate the stigmatisation and teasing l used to get from other students,and from that point l started cheating more and more .But one day l realized that l wanted to become a role model of other students through hard working and setting a positive example to them and also the fear of being caught cheating in my exams  and expelled changed my mind and l told myself that if l want to fairly succeed l need to work hard and become honesty.

However in trying to become honesty and hard working without cheating l faced so many difficulties as it became very hard to teach my mind that l was now taking a new path to success because whenever l thought of studying for my next examination my friends would laugh at me and try  to encourage me to cheat.But as someone who knew his what he wanted to become l stopped interacting with people who encouraged me to cheat and started looking for friends who had the same vision as me.And l started to perform very well in my exams.

Through hard working and honesty l learnt that there is no shortcut to success and through hard work one can develop skills like critical thinking and problem solving and also you become disciplined, resilient and determined thus shaping you for the challenges you might face ,and being honesty helps you know you strengths and weaknesses and help you set your goal accordingly and also being honesty creates an environment of open communication and this enhances person growth and add more experience within you.
