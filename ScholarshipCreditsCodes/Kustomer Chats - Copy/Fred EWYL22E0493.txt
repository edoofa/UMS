21/12/22, 00:45 - Unknown: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are well.

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift or an expensive one. More often than not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them.

In this session on the *EWYL Line*, we will talk about who would you want to be your secret Santa and why?
Please excuse me for yesterday, I was with Ms. Deepali for an important meeting.
21/12/22, 00:45 - Unknown: Along with this, since I have students who are going to school and many Indian students are also occupied with their classes and exams, I wanted to give all my students some flexibility so that they have their sessions with me and I am there to address all their concerns.
So, your batch is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from 11:30 AM-02:30 PM.

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.

2) this festive season is surely a thing to respect and participate because globally it allows us to unite as one as family members and share gifts etc. Not only that in the African way of doing it, they are drawn close to their God since they attend a church service.

10/01/23, 22:06 - Fred EWYL22E0493: Participating in community building projects.
12/01/23, 00:01 - Fred EWYL22E0493: On last weeks Wednesday wisdom. It focused on principles of persuasion. I learnt that reducing the availability of a product on the market can be used to lure many people to wanting it. Creating a sense of scarcity may be a way to persuade people into making a certain decision. The secondly, doing the unexpected eg buying someone a birthday present. This means that you have persuaded them into buying you also a gift the time when your birthday comes next time. So doing a favour to people will force them to do you also a favour thus they have been persuaded. If you want to influence and persuade people, first they need to like you. Building relationships with the people you want to influence is an important key. You need to gain their trust by giving them good genuine compliments, cooperation with them nicely. This you can be able to influence them. When humans make decisions, they usually consider what others are doing, that's what helps them make decisions sometimes. It's much more easier to influence the person who trusts you     than those that don't.
12/01/23, 00:09 - Fred EWYL22E0493: About my projects.
The cooperate alliance, many of the decision makers of organisations weren't back at work yet. 

The community building is underway, schools which opened this Tuesday were my main target.
12/01/23, 21:02 - Unknown: Happy Thursday my proud edoofian!
How are you doing?

Problem-solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem-solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals toward achieving this goal.

So can you please share what are your views on:
1) Wednesday lesson
2) progress on the projects
12/01/23, 21:04 - Unknown: Your response to the Wednesday wisdom is pretty impressive.
I got influenced by the line \"Building relationships with the people you want to influence is an important key. \"
12/01/23, 21:04 - Unknown: So may I know how will you be working on the Community Building project?

12/01/23, 23:09 - Unknown: Can I have your views on this week's Wednesday lesson and community building project?
12/01/23, 23:14 - Fred EWYL22E0493: I intend to visit local schools, get connected to students in Form 6 who are about to finish their high school.
12/01/23, 23:22 - Fred EWYL22E0493: I intend to visit local schools, get connected to students in Form 6 who are about to finish their high school.
12/01/23, 23:26 - Fred EWYL22E0493: First and foremost, you need to simplify problems by using no brainer questions. Some problems are not easily solved the way they look, so we must think and attempt them differently maybe by inverting them. Thinking in reverse may be very helpful. Big things are brought by a combination of large factors. You need to combine a lot of things to combine one big output which means sometimes you have to work outside of your working hours to solve problems. Think in a multidisciplinary manner.
12/01/23, 23:27 - Fred EWYL22E0493: For the community building project, i have started to visit local schools so as to get in touch with students who are about to finish their high school.
12/01/23, 23:28 - Unknown: Let me suggest you something better ways to do it.
12/01/23, 23:28 - Fred EWYL22E0493: Yes.
12/01/23, 23:29 - Unknown: Some of my students have formed a WhatsApp group where they:
First, they keep sharing the link of that WhatsApp group in their family groups, class groups, and school groups (A-Level and O-Level), with the children who stay nearby (who want to pursue their higher education), and, try to circulate all around.
Second, once new people get added to the group, they are told about Edoofa, the perks of being associated with it, why studying in India could be a great opportunity, their journey so far, learnings from EWYL Program, and more.
Third, they share the community building form with them, and then the children fill out the form and share it with them.
12/01/23, 23:30 - Unknown: I can very well relate to what you said about the 5 problem-solving strategies proposed by Charlie Munger.
I related most to the line, “Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Systematically you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. Nevertheless, you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts. Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day – if you live long enough – most people get what they deserve.”
12/01/23, 23:31 - Fred EWYL22E0493: ?
12/01/23, 23:32 - Fred EWYL22E0493: Spending each day trying to be a little wiser than you woke up. How didn't i included that statement??

How was your weekend?

 The ability to solve problems is a basic life skill and is essential to our day-to-day lives, at home, at school, and at work. We solve problems every day without really thinking about how we solve them. 
We talked about a situation and its probable ending.

In our session today:
1) how would you continue the situation as stated in the Weekend activity?
2) progress on the projects
16/01/23, 21:38 - Unknown: Also, I want to remind you of three important things that often skips from our mind.
1) the daily ritual needs to be followed *only on the EWYL Line.*
2) responses to the weekend activity and Wednesday lesson won't be accepted if they are shared on the EWY Group, they need to be shared *only on the EWYL Line.*
3) any forms that you receive for the community building project, share them on the *EWYL Group.*
16/01/23, 21:38 - Unknown: Moreover, we have a revised form for the community building project.
Please use this form only from tomorrow onwards, otherwise, they won't be counseled.
