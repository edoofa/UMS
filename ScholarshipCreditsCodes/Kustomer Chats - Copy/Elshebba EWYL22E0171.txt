It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

12/10/22, 01:19 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Hope you are doing well. This week we learned about one of the most popular yet grounded people who used social media as a tool to become an educator and give back to the community and still become an entrepreneur.
This week I want you to reflect on what your strengths and skills are to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 

These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content etc.
Please share these skills and instances where you were able to showcase these skills in your next session.
Till then 
Happy Learning!

31/10/22, 22:05 - Unknown: Hello, My Dear Proud Edoofian.

We all know that \"History is Written by Winners\", but not everybody knows the discipline, dedication, sacrifices, time, and efforts put behind it.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the kind of mindset a winner possesses, and about the person who carved his way from the bottom to the top, and even beyond. The story of a basketball player turning into a lethal black mamba on the court, the habits he formed, and the mindset he forged, to turn into a winner, is inspirational and the most practical way to better oneself every single day. You will learn a lot of different things from this lesson, about the attitude, instinct, and character of a true all-round winner.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

31/10/22, 22:33 - Unknown: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian.
I hope you are doing good.

\"A goal is not always meant to be reached; it often serves simply as something to aim at.\" –Bruce Lee

The above quote more or less means, True success is all about working towards meaningful goals and dreams.

And this was somewhat the idea we learned and discussed about in our Wednesday Lesson as well, the mindset of a winner and the habits that lead to it.

In this week's activity, you shall be putting this to use in your own working zone, by creating a list of targets\/goals, that you shall aim to achieve in a week. For a suggestion, you can start by setting up a number of Schools you would try connecting to in a week, or the number of companies you shall reach out to, or the number of fellow community mates you would tell about edoofa.

This list, you shall share with your mentors, and they would also keep a note of it. At the end of the week, you shall discuss with them, whether or not were you able to achieve the target, and what kind of mindset change did this activity lead you to.

I hope you all will try to push your limits and aim at sky always. This activity should be a part of habit building, that would make you a better and more organized individual and professional.

Happy Learning
