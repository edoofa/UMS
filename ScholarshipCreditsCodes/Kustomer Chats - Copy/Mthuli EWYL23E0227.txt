01/07/23, 12:16 - Ananya: Greetings, how are you today?
01/07/23, 12:16 - Mthuli EWYL23E0227: I am good, how are you
01/07/23, 12:17 - Ananya: I am doing great!
01/07/23, 12:17 - Ananya: How's everything at your home?
01/07/23, 12:17 - Mthuli EWYL23E0227: That is awesome
01/07/23, 12:18 - Mthuli EWYL23E0227: Everything is going well
01/07/23, 12:21 - Ananya: Great! So may I ask which one is your favorite project?

01/07/23, 12:28 - Ananya: That's great! So may I ask if you were able to connect with any school head?

01/07/23, 12:32 - Ananya: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
