01/02/23, 19:43 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

Happy Learning!

The inner sense of captaincy is a vital component of leadership that gives individuals the confidence and determination to make a positive impact. It involves having a deep understanding of oneself, embracing weaknesses, and having a positive growth-oriented mindset. Developing an inner sense of captaincy can help individuals navigate challenges, inspire and motivate others, and tap into their full potential as leaders. In today’s Wednesday wisdom, we will explore the importance of this aspect of leadership. 

We will discuss your key learnings in our upcoming session!

13/02/23, 21:07 - Unknown: One morning, an elderly man was walking along the beach when he noticed a young boy picking something off the sand and throwing it into the sea.

As he got closer, the man realized the child was throwing stranded starfishes that had washed up on the shore back into the breaking waves.

Approaching the boy, the man asked what he was doing.

“The starfish will die if they’re still on the shore when the sun rises,” he replied.

Perplexed, the old man said, “But that’s pointless! There are countless miles of beach and thousands of starfish. It doesn’t matter how many you return to the water, you can’t make a difference.”

Unfazed, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish, and tossed it into the sea.

“It matters to this one,” he said.","transform":"
