How are you?
22/05/23, 17:16 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
22/05/23, 17:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.


If you are ready then we can beginüéâ

29/05/23, 20:29 - Catherine EWYL23E0130: These are the results of my personality test.
29/05/23, 20:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above

05/06/23, 16:12 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, I mean can you share that out of the three projects that we have, which project would you prefer to focus more on?
I wish that since you live in Malawi, we can focus on Community Building project and channel everyone's vision.

05/06/23, 16:13 - Catherine EWYL23E0130: And can you please elaborate on it.
05/06/23, 16:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me share the project document with you. I am sure you remember these three projects that we discussed in-depth. In case of any doubt, do let me know.
05/06/23, 16:30 - Catherine EWYL23E0130: Thank you
05/06/23, 16:45 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know which project did you find most amusing?
05/06/23, 16:46 - Catherine EWYL23E0130: Community building
05/06/23, 16:53 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know:
A. What is your understanding of the project,
B and, how you wish to do it?
05/06/23, 17:01 - Catherine EWYL23E0130: Students which out to people to offer them an opportunity to be part of Edoofa's program. The people must be students who have just graduated from their secondary school because their next plan is tertiary education.
05/06/23, 17:02 - Catherine EWYL23E0130: B.

I will reach out to my friends so that they know about this program. I have done part of this before because I sent an offline form to some of my friends so that they know about Edoofa.
05/06/23, 17:20 - Saloni Rastogi: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
05/06/23, 17:21 - Saloni Rastogi: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You‚Äôre supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*

For eg: In your case, it will be-

*Catherine/Saloni/5JUNE2023*
05/06/23, 17:22 - Saloni Rastogi: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
05/06/23, 17:22 - Saloni Rastogi: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
05/06/23, 17:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
05/06/23, 17:23 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
05/06/23, 17:23 - Catherine EWYL23E0130: Ooh yesü•≤
06/06/23, 16:37 - Catherine EWYL23E0130: Am a proud Edoofian.
