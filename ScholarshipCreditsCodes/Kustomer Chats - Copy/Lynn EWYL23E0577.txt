25/11/23, 17:12 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL

As we embark on a new year, it's the perfect time to reflect on our aspirations and set goals for personal and academic growth. To kick off our Saturday activity, we invite you to share the goals you've set for yourself in the upcoming year, 2024.🎯

Whether your goals are related to academics, personal development, extracurricular activities, or any other aspect of your life, we want to hear about them! This is a wonderful opportunity for us to inspire and support one another as a community.

Please take a moment to jot down your goals and be prepared to share them during our Saturday activity. It could be something as simple as improving your study habits, achieving a certain grade, learning a new skill, or even fostering better connections with your peers.✨

Remember, setting goals is not only a way to envision your future but also a roadmap to success. By sharing your goals, you might inspire someone else to reach for their dreams as well.

Let's make 2024 a year of growth, achievement, and mutual support. We look forward to hearing about your aspirations during our Saturday activity.🤝
