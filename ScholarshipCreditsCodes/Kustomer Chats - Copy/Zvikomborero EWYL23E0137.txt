16/05/23, 17:40 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: Hello Ms Ananya l would want to resume my EWYL discussions my name is Zvikomborero Jacob Muzhingi.My EWYL group name is Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137
19/05/23, 20:21 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: 
19/05/23, 23:04 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.
Our sessions are on Tuesday and Friday from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM.
19/05/23, 23:05 - Ananya: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the Wednesday lesson. It is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.
20/05/23, 14:58 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: Good morning Ms Ananya
20/05/23, 14:58 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: Iam a Proud Edoofian
20/05/23, 14:59 - Ananya: `- That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!`

`- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.``- How do you intend to broaden this student community? 

In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.
20/05/23, 15:01 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: l beg your your pardon can you say  that again
20/05/23, 15:02 - Ananya: Are you ready or your session?
20/05/23, 15:02 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: yes
20/05/23, 15:14 - Ananya: Moving ahead, may I know if you were able to search for companies?
20/05/23, 15:15 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: not yet but l created my LinkedIn account
20/05/23, 15:19 - Ananya: You were supposed to search the companies on google, considering these factors:

1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.â€‹

24/06/23, 12:21 - Ananya: So, Zvikomborero I wanted to know about your progress on the projects. Are you facing any kind of challenges?
24/06/23, 12:21 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: Soryy to ask this personal question but when we had our first conversations you said something that you studied Biology is that right or lam mistakening?

24/06/23, 12:23 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: yes especially in engaging with companies on Linkedln l still cant figure out wht  to do on that
24/06/23, 12:28 - Ananya: I understand, Zvikomborero! However, for now, we have put that project on hold. When we decide to resume it, we will schedule a session to discuss it. Is that okay with you?
24/06/23, 12:29 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: ohh ok impressive .So on my next year university program l stated that l would want to study Bsc in Microbiology but l also heard that if l need that changed l can because lately l have been thinking of pursueing Physiotherapy .So since you are well versed with Biology stuff perhaps you you can  assist me on the right choice of program.
24/06/23, 12:30 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: ok fine
24/06/23, 12:31 - Ananya: Sure, Zvikomborero!
24/06/23, 12:34 - Ananya: Well, the right choice depends on your interests, career goals, and personal aptitude.
24/06/23, 12:37 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: l want physiotherapy is it offfered in the universities that Edoofa has patnered with?
24/06/23, 12:37 - Ananya: If you wish to study further and have an interest in research and innovation, pursuing Microbiology would be a suitable choice. This field focuses on the study of microorganisms and their impact on various aspects of life. With a BSc in Microbiology, you can delve into research, contribute to scientific advancements, and work in fields such as public health, pharmaceuticals, clinical diagnostics, and environmental science.
24/06/23, 12:37 - Ananya: On the other hand, if you're interested in stepping into the healthcare and hospitality sectors, Physiotherapy could be a good fit. Physiotherapy emphasizes optimizing movement and function in individuals with physical limitations or disabilities. With a degree in Physiotherapy, you can work as a physiotherapist, helping patients recover from injuries, managing chronic conditions, and enhancing overall physical well-being. You also have the option to pursue a master's degree in Physiotherapy, which can further enhance your skills and open up opportunities for advanced practice.
24/06/23, 12:37 - Ananya: In India, after completing your studies in Physiotherapy, you can start practicing as a licensed physiotherapist. This allows you to work in healthcare facilities, rehabilitation centers, private clinics, or even establish your own practice. Additionally, if you decide to return to your home country, you can contribute to your country's healthcare system by providing therapies and rehabilitation services to patients.
24/06/23, 12:38 - Ananya: Yes, physiotherapy is offered by the universities partner with Edoofa!
24/06/23, 12:38 - Ananya: Yes, physiotherapy is offered by the universities that partner with Edoofa!

24/06/23, 12:46 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: And also can you tell me about the duration of the course because microbiology had 3 years
24/06/23, 12:48 - Ananya: Thank you for your kind words, Zvikomborero! For changing your course you have to connect with your admissions officer!
24/06/23, 12:50 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: you are welcome.ok thank you
24/06/23, 12:50 - Ananya: They will let you know everything about the course, college, duration dn fee structure.
24/06/23, 12:53 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: ok.which time period is best for me to make the changes now or when l get to India next year?
24/06/23, 12:56 - Ananya: Before making a final decision, it would be advisable to discuss your plans with your parents and seek their input. Once you have reached a decision, it is important to inform the admissions team within the next week.
24/06/23, 12:57 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: ok fine
24/06/23, 12:59 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: About being a licensed physiotherapist can l get a license after acquiring my degree or it needs a Masters degree?
24/06/23, 13:02 - Ananya: Zvikomborero, Having a degree can be seen as a license for your chosen field. However, if you need more information about this, it's best to ask the admissions team at your university. They are the experts who can give you the best advice and guidance on this topic.
24/06/23, 13:03 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: ok thank you
24/06/23, 13:04 - Ananya: Well, Zvikomborero I hope you are aware of an amazing grant opportunity coming up, and for that, Today, our team had a discussion with Mr. Angad Sir, Ms. Deepali, and Ms. Davi to evaluate students, and next week the evaluation process will begin.

I care about your success, and I don't want you to miss out on any important opportunities. I want you to be open to grabbing every chance that comes your way. That's why I'm thinking of focusing on helping you for a few days, so you can be well-prepared for this life-changing opportunity. Can I trust that you'll make the most of this opportunity and be willing to listen to my guidance?
24/06/23, 13:07 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: No l m not aware .Sure l will l will not disappoint you
24/06/23, 13:08 - Ananya: I had the idea of setting small daily targets for you, which will eventually help you reach a specific overall target. Is that something you're comfortable with?
24/06/23, 13:10 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: l can have a challenge on *daily* basis but maybe l have to know what it is and give a try
24/06/23, 13:16 - Ananya: There is no requirement for you to attend the session on a daily basis. You can work on your tasks at your convenience and submit them whenever you are available. I will respond to your submissions during my available time.
24/06/23, 13:16 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: ohh ok that will work
24/06/23, 13:18 - Ananya: For today, I have a task for you related to the community-building project. I would like you to approach only five students and ask them to fill in the forms and submit them to me by tomorrow evening.
24/06/23, 13:25 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0137: uhmm l have a challenge on that but l promise by Monday l can be able to do so
24/06/23, 13:30 - Ananya: Sure, I understand. You can expect to receive my input by Monday afternoon. Is that acceptable to you?
