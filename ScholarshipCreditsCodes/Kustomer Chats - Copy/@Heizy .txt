09/11/23, 13:10 - @Heizy : Diwali, the festival of lights, is a significant celebration in Indian culture, marked by fervent enthusiasm and vibrant festivities. It symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and good over evil, and is associated with the worship of Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity. Diwali holds profound spiritual significance, as it honors Lord Rama's return to Ayodhya after defeating Ravana, signifying the triumph of righteousness and the importance of upholding moral values. It also emphasizes the significance of gratitude and generosity, fostering empathy, kindness, and a sense of interconnectedness within society. Diwali underscores the significance of family and community bonds, encouraging people to come together and strengthen relationships. As the Edoofa student community immerses itself in the festivities of Diwali, they may carry its transformative teachings into their lives and endeavors.
