I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
22/06/23, 15:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.

Tell us if these were helpful for you in the comments below!
01/07/23, 15:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self‚Äîthe person you aspire to be‚Äîand consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!
01/07/23, 15:17 - Saloni Rastogi: I am sharing standard information with you for the grant document shared yesterday. Make sure you have your full attention.
01/07/23, 15:17 - Saloni Rastogi: In these 21 days, I want that we engage in the best possible manner to bring out fruitful results.

So this time you have to be *REGULAR IN YOUR SESSIONS*


Before we begin, let's go over what a complete session involves. üìö

‚ñ™Ô∏è First of all, you have to *come to the EWYL LINE every single day and tell me HOW PROUD ARE YOU being an Edoofian* (Including Sundays and even on days you don't have your session). This means _following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' without fail on the EWYL Line._

‚ñ™Ô∏è Secondly, It's essential to *arrive on time for the session*, as being late will not be considered as attending a session. _This brings the importance of being punctual for the session._

‚ñ™Ô∏è During our sessions, we'll cover two key topics: the *Wednesday Lesson or Weekend Activity* and *Project Updates*


To ensure your progress, I will ask for your Lessons or Activities submissions during the session. It's essential to be prepared and ready to share your work when prompted.üéì
01/07/23, 15:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Now, let's talk about a challenge that is included in the above-mentioned Project Update! ‚úàÔ∏è
I have set a target for the next 21 days, which involves sharing:


*45 Community Building forms*
and
*2 School Connect forms*


To mark a session as completed, your active presence is required throughout our session time. If you encounter any network or mobile issues, I recommend addressing them beforehand so that we can make the most of our time together.

Remember, excuses won't be accepted because I believe in your determination.
01/07/23, 15:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Coming to the point that you might have also noticed and something that brings a flavor to this challenge is Extra Curricular activity


When it comes to overall assessment and evaluation, we believe it's not just about projects and lessons. It's about how passionate you are about yourself. Therefore, there is another aspect for evaluation, which is extracurricular activities.

In the next 21 days, It's your turn to show your amazing talent and be better than all the other students in this thrilling competition. Show everyone what you can do and make them amazed by your skills.

As your mentor, I want you to tell me about what else you are good at besides academics and share your idea of how you will showcase that talent to us.
01/07/23, 15:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Please acknowledge if you are with me on this journey to obtain the Edoofa Grant and if yes, then do share about which extra curricular activity will you be taking forward.
03/07/23, 13:01 - Candice EWYL23E0182: Yes
03/07/23, 13:02 - Candice EWYL23E0182: I like public speaking, debate, quiz
03/07/23, 13:02 - Candice EWYL23E0182: Good morning
03/07/23, 13:02 - Candice EWYL23E0182: I am a proud Edoofian

03/07/23, 13:09 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Please share your progress on the following:

~ Weekend Activity
~ Project Update : No of form you will be sharing this week and how are you working towards it?
03/07/23, 13:22 - Candice EWYL23E0182: Safely saying I have made it is really a relief to most of us but what does it really take to reach there. It takes up all the determination, the energy and the sweat left in you. The secret of getting ahead is getting started.The main aim is to never give up even if the road seems long. I never thought that I would be part of the wonderful community. I quote "Success is not final, failure is not fatal;it is the courage to continue that counts" Winston Churchill. The words kept on ringing in my mind that even if I give up no one is going to finish the race that I started or me. I was inspired by a lot of people that if they can make it therm so can I. Bit by bit we are all going to get there after all the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step. Courage, faith and most of all hardwork can really get one where he/she wants to be.
03/07/23, 13:22 - Candice EWYL23E0182: Project update: People are really adamant that they have already planned out where they are going to university
03/07/23, 13:26 - Saloni Rastogi: I appreciate your thoughtful reflection and the motivation it carries. It's true that reaching our goals requires determination, energy, and perseverance. The journey may be challenging, but it's important to remember that the key to progress is simply getting started. It's inspiring to see your commitment to never giving up, even when faced with obstacles. The quote from Winston Churchill serves as a powerful reminder that success is not about reaching a final destination or avoiding failure, but rather about having the courage to keep moving forward.
03/07/23, 13:26 - Saloni Rastogi: I'm glad that my response resonated with you, and I'm here to support and provide motivation whenever you need it. Keep embracing courage, faith, and hard work, for they will guide you towards your desired destination. Remember, step by step, you will continue to progress and achieve your goals. Best of luck on your journey, and I'm confident that you will reach the heights you aspire to.
03/07/23, 13:27 - Candice EWYL23E0182: Thank you
03/07/23, 13:27 - Candice EWYL23E0182: I will üòä
03/07/23, 13:28 - Saloni Rastogi: What about the students who are still in A-Level?
03/07/23, 13:29 - Candice EWYL23E0182: They are the ones that I am talking about
03/07/23, 13:30 - Candice EWYL23E0182: There are a few that will get back to me though
03/07/23, 13:40 - Saloni Rastogi: Here is an audio of Persistance Muza, Edoofa's highest earner who has earned beyond $4,800 scholarship credits and this is his story
Have a look at how he has transformed his journey

06/07/23, 13:26 - Candice EWYL23E0182: Continuously performing a certain task helps one to yield better results in such a way that one becomes better and better by that. Once one gets used to a task it serves as a motivation to continue pushing hard because you know you can do it and there is also progress in that as where there is progress there is success

15/07/23, 14:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
I hope you're doing well. 

I regret to inform you that the Weekend activity was not shared with you because you did not follow today's daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

I want to share with you the essence of being an Edoofian. An Edoofian is a strong individual who stands up for those without a voice, a future leader dedicated to self-improvement and bringing positive change to their country. They put in the necessary effort to succeed, aiming to make their family proud. Edoofians are responsible, and sensible, and believe that the sky is the limit. As an Edoofian, you should feel a sense of pride and honor. Starting today, I kindly request that you text me first thing in the morning on the EWYL Line with the phrase "I am a proud Edoofian."

It's important to avoid being listed as a defaulter with the Academic Board of Edoofa‚ö†Ô∏è. Please consider this and share your feedback with me.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to hearing from you.
15/07/23, 14:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for this message Candice, shared with you by mistake.

17/07/23, 13:07 - Candice EWYL23E0182: One of the many people I admire in my life is Mr Strive Masiyiwa who is a philanthropist and a renowned business man.He is an inspiration to many and he has many achievements throughout his life and career. Mr Masiyiwa started his own electrical engineering company and soon he wanted to diversify into telecoms.He then faced problems with the government which did not want to give him a license to operate his business. Above all, he did not give up on his dream. After a five year old battle all ruled in his favour and he pursued his dream. In 2015, he was given named in the 10 most powerful men in Africa and the International Refugee Commitee(IRC) awarded him the Freedom Award which isannually given to an individual for an extraordinary contribution towards refugees and championing the causes of liberty, individual freedom and dignity. Mr Masiyiwa inspires me because he never gave up on his dreams and he continued pushing. I quote"Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time"Thomas Edison. Mr Masiyiwa's successes have always pushed me on because success doesn't just come at the moment but it takes time, patience, determination and hardwork.
17/07/23, 13:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy new week my proud edoofianüìö
