How are you doing today?
24/08/23, 13:11 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: I'm fine and you
24/08/23, 13:11 - Ananya: I am feeling better now. Please accept my apologies for not being able to join our last session. I was unwell and had taken a day off as a result.
24/08/23, 13:12 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: It is okay
24/08/23, 13:14 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.
24/08/23, 13:18 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: Yes I got it
24/08/23, 13:19 - Ananya: Now, I believe it is important to understand your priorities and interests. Therefore, I want to begin by asking which of those three EWYL projects, you liked the most?
24/08/23, 13:21 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: Wednesday wisdom
24/08/23, 13:24 - Ananya: No the projects dear! The community building, cooperate alliance or the school reform?
24/08/23, 13:26 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: Okay...the community building
24/08/23, 13:28 - Ananya: Now, I believe it is essential to understand your priorities and interests. Therefore, I want to begin by asking which of those three EWYL projects, you liked the most.
24/08/23, 13:29 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: The most is community building
24/08/23, 13:30 - Ananya: That's lovely! So why don't we begin with this project and I will be sharing some amazing tips and tricks! Are you excited?
24/08/23, 13:31 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: Yes I am
24/08/23, 13:31 - Ananya: So, may I ask if you were able to create a community-building group as we discussed in our group?
24/08/23, 13:35 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: No I was having a challenge there ...
24/08/23, 13:36 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: I just create the group and add you or I create then I talk to them before adding you
24/08/23, 13:37 - Ananya: Excellent, now let me help you increase the number of students in that group and thereby expand your community.
24/08/23, 13:39 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: Ok
24/08/23, 13:41 - Ananya: Another thing you can do is:
Go to Facebook and search for "Student Communities in Zimbabwe"

Join a relevant group from the appeared results.

Share information about Edoofa and include the WhatsApp group link.

Interested individuals can join the group and connect with you.

Communicate with them and provide further details about Edoofa.
24/08/23, 13:42 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: OK thank this is of much help
24/08/23, 13:46 - Ananya: So for community building:
1) Keep the group updated DAILY.
2) Try reaching out to students from different schools
3) Try reaching out to teachers from your school or others and ask them to share the link to your WhatsApp group with other school teachers from different schools
4) In the group just:
-please give 'only admins' access
-just ask the students/participants to DM you to know about Edoofa and to get the form
-once they DM you, share about Edoofa with them
-Before sharing the form, ask them to get you added to their school groups
-once they do that, then only share the form with them.‚Äã
‚Äã5) Use social media as your sword to tell people about Edoofa
24/08/23, 13:53 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: OK noted
24/08/23, 13:57 - Ananya: Now, Nostalgia, in order to maintain a specific credit balance in your account and ensure your active participation, I will create a personalized target table for you. Before doing that, I need to evaluate your performance. To accomplish this, I'm assigning you a small target, and I hope you will be able to excel at it. Are you up for this?
24/08/23, 14:03 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: Yes I am
24/08/23, 14:04 - Ananya: You have to submit 2 community-building forms with me by Saturday evening, is that alright?

31/08/23, 13:13 - Ananya: So may I ask if you were able to read the newsletter?

31/08/23, 13:16 - Ananya: That is alright, I understand. Now Nostalgia may I ask if you have a community building group?

31/08/23, 13:31 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: Ok thank you
31/08/23, 13:36 - Ananya: Now, may I ask if you were able to find the contact information of the school head?
31/08/23, 13:37 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: Yes I dis
31/08/23, 13:37 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: Did*
31/08/23, 13:40 - Ananya: So did you text him/her?
31/08/23, 13:41 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: Yes I managed to arrange a meeting with her
31/08/23, 13:42 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: I sent the form to this line
31/08/23, 13:43 - Ananya: Yes, that I have received. I am talking about other school heads!
31/08/23, 13:45 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: Not yet I'm working on it
31/08/23, 13:48 - Ananya: You know, recently we had a meeting with Angad Sir, and as a whole team, we were planning to introduce some external projects! I'm sharing this information with my students early because these external projects will be considered as valuable experience when they pursue their future dream jobs!
These projects will only be offered to students who have excelled in the EWYL journey and previous projects, as they demonstrate dedication and consistency. So, I think it's essential for us to start preparing as soon as possible. Together, we will brainstorm creative ways to maintain our positive reputation and excellent record. What are your thoughts on this?
31/08/23, 13:50 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: Yes it sounds great...so  what do you mean by external projects
31/08/23, 13:56 - Ananya: Projects other than edoofa projects.
31/08/23, 13:58 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: Okay I understand
31/08/23, 14:01 - Ananya: Indeed, last year when students came to India, only well-performing students were offered some amazing projects and had the opportunity to work with renowned brands like Sirona!
Therefore, I want you to be proactive and consistent with your EWYL projects so that you can uphold your reputation in the EWYL department. This way, when an external project comes up, your name will immediately come to mind as a top candidate. Keep up the hard work, and you'll create more opportunities for yourself in the future!
31/08/23, 14:03 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: Well noted ma'am
31/08/23, 14:04 - Ananya: So I hope you are ready for it.
31/08/23, 14:04 - Nostalgia EWYL23E0414: Does the project have to be in the same path as the career you studying for or it is just randomly
