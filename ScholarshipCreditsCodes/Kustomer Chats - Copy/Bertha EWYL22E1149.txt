Thank you so much
04/03/23, 18:51 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: What's for today ma'am?
04/03/23, 19:13 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Morning Bertha, Hope you are doing well. 
Well, that's great Bertha!
04/03/23, 19:14 - Jasmine Kaur: I have something very interesting for you today. 
Are you excited to listen?
04/03/23, 19:18 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Yes ma'am
04/03/23, 19:19 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: I hope you are doing well
04/03/23, 19:21 - Jasmine Kaur: I am absolutely fine dear. Thanks for asking.
04/03/23, 19:23 - Jasmine Kaur: First of all, I would like to congratulate you on being selected for the Community Service Project. I have been observing your active participation and interest in the EWYL program so I have chosen you to take part in a special project where you will be reaching out to hospitals, salons, and convenience stores.

From this project, you will learn how to collect relevant data and how this data can be used to help and analyze how the resources are consumed in a particular area and the relationship amongst them.

The scholarship credits that you can earn from this project are a total of $20, which you will get when you complete each and every task every day successfully. In the worst-case scenario, if you are not able to complete the task given to you before the deadline due to a genuine reason, you will only be given the credits for the tasks you have accomplished, so make sure not to miss out on any task to attain the maximum credits from this project.

Duration of project: 1 month
04/03/23, 19:28 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Can you please explain to me what exactly i do when i reach out to hospitals stores and salons?
04/03/23, 19:28 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: And thank you
04/03/23, 19:28 - Jasmine Kaur: Sure dear
04/03/23, 19:30 - Jasmine Kaur: I would like you to go through both documents and share your understanding of them with me by tomorrow. Remember this is the golden opportunity for you to earn the scholarship credits.
04/03/23, 19:37 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: I thought you do not work on Sundays 
Should i still submit my understandings tomorrow?
04/03/23, 19:40 - Jasmine Kaur: That's very well thought of you Bertha. 
Ummm in that case we can do one thing. If you manage to go through the document today, share your understandings and doubts.
04/03/23, 19:40 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Its the same document as the first 
Is it supposed to be the same document?
04/03/23, 19:40 - Jasmine Kaur: By today
04/03/23, 19:41 - Jasmine Kaur: No, both are different documents Bertha.
04/03/23, 19:43 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Ms Jasmine the documents you have sent me are identical i have checked them both
04/03/23, 19:45 - Jasmine Kaur: No dear, open the documents. Most things might be the same. But forms are different and credit distribution is also different.

One is for salons and convenience stores and the other is for doctors, clinics, and pharmacies.
04/03/23, 19:47 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Ohhhh let me go through the second one thoroughly
04/03/23, 19:51 - Jasmine Kaur: Sure
04/03/23, 21:24 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: According to my understanding 
I am supposed to get thorough information about these places of work then i will make a detailed account of the information i will obtain and later present it to you.
For the saloons and convenient stores i believe they have to be registered correct?
06/03/23, 04:20 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: I am a proud Edoofian
06/03/23, 04:24 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Am i not supposed to receive a newsletter?
06/03/23, 04:24 - Jasmine Kaur: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”
06/03/23, 04:31 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: On which platform is the newsletter supposed to be received?
06/03/23, 17:15 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Good morning
06/03/23, 17:15 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: I am a proud Edoofian

06/03/23, 17:35 - Jasmine Kaur: I appreciate your punctuality and dedication to our 8:30 am session today, Bertha. Your commitment is truly inspiring. As Thomas Jefferson once said, 'Punctuality is the virtue of the bored.'
06/03/23, 17:36 - Jasmine Kaur: How was your weekend? I hope it was great.
06/03/23, 17:37 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Thank you
06/03/23, 17:37 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Honestly it wasn't 
But i hope yours was better
06/03/23, 17:38 - Jasmine Kaur: Why is that? Do you want to share?
06/03/23, 17:40 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Its was honestly irritating 
I had a bad day yesterday and Saturday did not go as planned, i was supposed to go for a donation but plans changed at the last minute.
06/03/23, 17:40 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: All in all 
I don't want to let my weekend ruin my Monday
06/03/23, 17:42 - Jasmine Kaur: I'm sorry to hear that you had a rough weekend and your plans for donation didn't work out. It's understandable that it can be frustrating when things don't go as planned. However, I'm glad to hear that you don't want to let it ruin your Monday.
06/03/23, 17:43 - Jasmine Kaur: My  weekend was pretty boring too.
06/03/23, 17:43 - Jasmine Kaur: But, I still have high hopes from Monday??
06/03/23, 17:45 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: You probably were just home weren't you ?
My typical weekend when i have no plans.
06/03/23, 17:45 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Lets the Monday begin with grace
06/03/23, 17:49 - Jasmine Kaur: Woooh, How did you know that.
06/03/23, 17:49 - Jasmine Kaur: I was actually at home and that too alone.
06/03/23, 17:49 - Jasmine Kaur: This made my weekend boring.
06/03/23, 17:50 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Why?
Do you live alone or your family members had gone somewhere?
06/03/23, 17:52 - Jasmine Kaur: Currently I live with my friend. She also works here with me.
06/03/23, 17:52 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: I'm usually on books at home if I'm not donating and i remember telling you that you and i were alike ? in some way so i pretty much just guessed
06/03/23, 17:52 - Jasmine Kaur: Usually I go home on weekends but this time there was some change in the plan.
06/03/23, 17:53 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Ohhh that's pretty cool
06/03/23, 17:54 - Jasmine Kaur: Cool up to some extent. Sometimes it's tough also.
06/03/23, 17:54 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Is home far from work 
I bet you miss your parents  and siblings ?
06/03/23, 17:54 - Jasmine Kaur: I have to do everything on my own.
06/03/23, 17:54 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: How is living alone ever tough ?
06/03/23, 17:55 - Jasmine Kaur: Of course I miss my family a lot.
06/03/23, 17:56 - Jasmine Kaur: Haha, I use to think the same that living alone is fun but cooking on my own, and managing my expenses is tough.
06/03/23, 17:56 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: I was at a boarding school and i kinda got the feel of living alone 
Honestly going to India won't be bad for me even if I'm alone
06/03/23, 17:57 - Jasmine Kaur: Boarding School. That's fun
06/03/23, 17:57 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: I don't think i can even be eating if i were to live alone 
Fingers crossed my university has a cafeteria
06/03/23, 17:57 - Jasmine Kaur: Well you will not be alone in India. I will visit you often and you will make friends too.
06/03/23, 17:57 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: To some extent it was fun but i did get lonely at times
06/03/23, 17:58 - Jasmine Kaur: HAHAHA, Let me give you one good news then
06/03/23, 17:58 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Fingers crossed ?
06/03/23, 17:58 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Lay it on me?
06/03/23, 17:58 - Jasmine Kaur: Your university will have a mess in which they will serve you Breakfast, Lunch, Snacks, and  Dinner.
06/03/23, 17:59 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Sorry i do get carried away when I'm conversing
06/03/23, 17:59 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Thank God 
???
06/03/23, 18:00 - Jasmine Kaur: I think I too got carried away. But sometimes it's fine I guess.
06/03/23, 18:01 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: I've been meaning to ask 
My parents aren't currently financially stable as promised because of some court cases that arose n i didn't manage to pay the second part of the enrolment fee and its been bothering me 
Do you think it will affect anything ?
06/03/23, 18:01 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Its necessary ?
06/03/23, 18:02 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: I am working extra hard on the EWYL to try and cover but the fee but its taking some time
06/03/23, 18:05 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, You should do that.

I'm actually going to a clinic today for data collection ?
06/03/23, 18:07 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: There's no limit to how much I gain correct?
06/03/23, 18:08 - Jasmine Kaur: Well that's great Bertha. For the medical one, You have to submit a minimum of 5 complete forms which will be verified by our team.
06/03/23, 18:08 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes there is no upper limit to that.
06/03/23, 18:09 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: I'm excited to be at the clinic 
I enjoy learning and i feel I'll learn alot
06/03/23, 18:09 - Jasmine Kaur: If you will give 20 medical forms, you will get 20$ once the forms are verified.
06/03/23, 18:09 - Jasmine Kaur: If you will give 30 forms, you will get 30$
06/03/23, 18:09 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: As a bonus or just for submitting so many
06/03/23, 18:11 - Jasmine Kaur: No actually every medical form equals to 1$
06/03/23, 18:16 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: I thought every verified information on the form is a dollar ?
06/03/23, 18:16 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: That means i have a busy week ?
06/03/23, 18:17 - Bertha EWYL22E1149: Any way
