My name is Aaliyah Winnie James .
I am here to resume my EWYL journey and my group name is Aaliyah EWYL22E0311
31/07/22, 03:54 - Aaliyah EWYL22E0311: Hello .
I am a proud Edoofian
31/07/22, 03:55 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

03/08/22, 01:34 - Saloni Rastogi: I am so happy to see you following our daily ritual Aaliyah.
03/08/22, 01:35 - Saloni Rastogi: A timetable is a framework that lets individuals see specific activities lined up. In this framework, it shows the tie allotment among several tasks and courses. It ensures equal distribution of time among activities and subjects, creates a smooth workflow, prevents wasting of time and efforts, and aids in creating good habits.
The *weekend activity* asked you to draw a timetable for yourself and of course, have time for your scheduled sessions as well.
I am really excited to see your timetable on the EWYL Line and of course, we can discuss how we can manage our sessions accordingly.
In this session today, we will discuss:
1. your timetable (as a part of weekend activity)
2. progress on community building projects
03/08/22, 01:35 - Aaliyah EWYL22E0311: Thank you its my pleasure!
03/08/22, 01:35 - Saloni Rastogi: You can share your timetable in the given format with me.
03/08/22, 01:39 - Aaliyah EWYL22E0311: Okay l will share it as soon as lm done

The weekend activity was something different this time. It did not talk about any other person but rather it was a self-introspection for ourselves, identifying and realizing our strong and weak points.
I am very excited to discuss them, what can be done about the, how are you working on them, and what could be the best possible solution.
So the aim of today's session on the EWYL Line is:
1. sharing your views on weekend activity 
2. important discussion on the community building project.

06/01/23, 14:23 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

How are you doing today?

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. This week's Wednesday wisdom gave you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

In our session today, we will discuss:
▪️your understanding of persuasion
▪️targets for the projects for the month of January 2023
