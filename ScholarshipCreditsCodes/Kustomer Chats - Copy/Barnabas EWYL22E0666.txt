17/10/22, 23:02 - Saloni Rastogi: I want that you follow the daily ritual by just saying 'I am a proud edoofian', don't use any symbols Barnabas.
17/10/22, 23:03 - Saloni Rastogi: [5:26 pm, 17\/10\/2022] Saloni Rastogi: How are you?
[5:27 pm, 17\/10\/2022] Saloni Rastogi: This week I want you to reflect on your strengths and skills to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 
These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content, etc.

In the session on the EWYL Line, we will discuss:
1) your social media skill
2) video that can become the face of edoofa-information about the same will be given only after yu share the response with me.
17/10/22, 23:04 - Saloni Rastogi: I am sorry for the error Barnabas.

18/10/22, 21:43 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

I am excited to discuss both things with you!

25/10/22, 21:41 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!`
`How are you?`
``
`As a part of your weekend activity, you were supposed to write,`
`• mail stating your exam schedule and your date rejoining the EWYL sessions attaching your datesheet\/exam schedule as a part of mail`

`or`

`• mail addressing me about what has been my role in shaping your career so far and what you have learnt from me, being specific there.

`In our session today:`
`- mail drafted by you`
25/10/22, 21:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share the details of that edoofian who is going against it?
Also, may I know what do you need for the edoofa vision- like a poster or anything else?
25/10/22, 21:56 - Barnabas EWYL22E0666: I mean can you say this person is telling lies.
If so, can you defend yourself.
25/10/22, 21:56 - Barnabas EWYL22E0666: Noted.
25/10/22, 22:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Of course these must be lies Barnabas but before just declaring or stating that the person is telling lies, it is important that we clarify the concerns that this individual has as to what Edoofa is actually doing. The main issue is not posting something on the social media platform, the bigger concern is that we need to have a look at what the other person is thinking and what led him to think in that certain way.
25/10/22, 23:28 - Barnabas EWYL22E0666: Yes they need to understand his motive but I used to chart with him I see that he is not pleased with your services. It seems like you are after something hidden not after helping people with scholarships.

26/10/22, 04:41 - Saloni Rastogi: That is the reason I am asking that you share his\/her details with me so that I can clarify what is he\/she missing.
26/10/22, 05:40 - Barnabas EWYL22E0666: I don't have.... I don't know his\/her details.
This person introduces himself but I changed a cellular phone so the charts were lost, I don't remember the name. 
He is not telling me his\/ her name.
26/10/22, 05:44 - Barnabas EWYL22E0666: Sorry ma'am based on the context I send you, aren't you able to  analyse and conclude how true is this.
 *Knowledge is power* 
Don't take advantage of ignorance please.
26/10/22, 05:48 - Barnabas EWYL22E0666: Without threatening each other... I saw that this messages are straight forward. They don't need interpretation. The concern of this person is so clear.

Now I'm lost dear ma'am.
May you give me supportive points against this person if he\/she is telling lies.
27/10/22, 15:25 - Barnabas EWYL22E0666: I'm a proud Edoofian.

I wil kindly update you in time if I'm not able to conduct the session so that you could also schedule your time well.
I hope these are some of the things I wish to change so that we could swiftly move on with the EWYL syllabus.
27/10/22, 23:31 - Barnabas EWYL22E0666: I'm doing good dear Mentor.

What about yourself?
27/10/22, 23:31 - Barnabas EWYL22E0666: Acknowledged.
I'm glad to know that.
I learnt valuable skills and information that leads to success.

Thank you.
28/10/22, 01:35 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the kind of mindset a winner possesses, and about the person who carved his way from the bottom to the top, and even beyond. 

In this session on the *EWYL Line*, we will talk about:
1) your opinions on the Wednesday lesson
2) pending mail as a part of the weekend activity
28/10/22, 01:35 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, I completely understand what you have said Barnabas and I am happy with the affirmation that you have shared with me.
I want t add what I feel- Punctuality and showing respect in this growing stage of life are the foundation of success. Success is meaningless without them. I am always looking to pass these lessons on to the younger players, they are the secret to excelling and developing their game.
28/10/22, 01:35 - Barnabas EWYL22E0666: Noted.

How are you?
01/11/22, 21:05 - Saloni Rastogi: This week we had an amazing chance to showcase our gratitude towards the whole Edoofa team, how they helped you to aspire and dream BIG.

In our session on the EWYL Line, we will discuss:
1) two screenshots of Google review and Facebook review
01/11/22, 21:05 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' on the EWYL Line.
01/11/22, 21:39 - Barnabas EWYL22E0666: I'm a proud Edoofian
01/11/22, 21:39 - Saloni Rastogi: I see you have typed two, this means you are unclear as to who a proud edoofian is and what it denotes.
01/11/22, 21:40 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
01/11/22, 21:40 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
01/11/22, 21:40 - Barnabas EWYL22E0666: I'm doing well how are you.
01/11/22, 21:41 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride.

I'm finishing my exams on 16th of November , I will be happy if we continue with our EWYL journey soon after I finished my exams. This will give me the chance to put my special attention on the projects and smooth conversation with you. Thank you. ?
03/11/22, 23:23 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Barnabas!
How are you?
03/11/22, 23:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
03/11/22, 23:25 - Saloni Rastogi: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and Ms. Davi, Head Coach EWYL stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to  davi@edoofa.com, and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com.


Once done, please let me know.
