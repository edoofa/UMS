25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

26/07/22, 04:04 - Takudzwanashe EWYL22E0376: Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing. On the mindset of successful people, they have focus on their source of income and possible ways that can help them in the generation of more income. As an individual, I hereby cope with the same mindset so as to achieve successfully in life that is to be determined and self oriented to whatever vital towards my success. Furthermore, I will also have to be hardworking towards my goal and always be positive and always believe in myself.
Successful people also have a right attitude and they take all the responsibility either for their success or failure , they do not hold any blame to anyone. 

The key observations from the lesson is attitude. If one wants to achieve something in life they must get to work as things don’t happen magically.Hence, I have to get to work to get things happen.

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
