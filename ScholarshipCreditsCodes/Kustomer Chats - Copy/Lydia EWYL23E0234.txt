20/11/23, 12:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Good morning Lydia,
I trust this message finds you well.

I'm genuinely excited about our upcoming sessions scheduled for Monday from 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM. As we gear up for today's session on the EWYL Line, I've been giving some thought to ways we can enhance our engagement and involve your parents in the process.

After careful consideration, we've decided to shift our sessions to the *EWYL Group starting tomorrow*. This change not only allows us to keep your parents in the loop but also it will also remove the dependency on your following the daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

Starting *tomorrow*, our sessions will be held from *09:00 AM to 10:00 AM, Monday to Friday*, on the *EWYL Group*. This adjustment aims to streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this change to confirm your understanding.

I look forward to our continued collaboration!
20/11/23, 12:58 - Lydia EWYL23E0234: Understood
20/11/23, 13:08 - Saloni Rastogi: I'm thrilled about our academic journey! ðŸš€ Let's remember this quote:
ðŸ‘£ "1 Step Daily = 1 Step UP" ðŸ“ˆ ðŸš« "0 Step Daily = 1 Step DOWN" ðŸ“‰
We'll make each day count for your learning and earning goals. Let's get started! ðŸ’ªðŸ“šðŸ’°
20/11/23, 13:11 - Lydia EWYL23E0234: I agree.
20/11/23, 13:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Weâ€™re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once youâ€™ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
20/11/23, 13:18 - Saloni Rastogi: .
20/11/23, 13:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Have you read the document?
20/11/23, 14:06 - Lydia EWYL23E0234: Yes I have
20/11/23, 14:11 - Saloni Rastogi: Okay, thatâ€™s wonderful. Lydia- I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we donâ€™t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
20/11/23, 14:40 - Lydia EWYL23E0234: It is a document about the "Earn While You Learn" program how it helps young people gain work experience while they're still in school. It's designed to help them develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the workforce and a variety of other social benefits..It can be archived through 2 separate programs one archived through creating an LinkedIn account inorder to operate with those who will be interested in Partaking or investing in the Edoofa program....Then the second program can be done through having interactions with different schools influencing them to also have their students to be part of the Edoofa program...
20/11/23, 18:54 - Saloni Rastogi: This is amazing, we will discuss this tomorrow.
22/11/23, 13:11 - Lydia EWYL23E0234: Good morning
