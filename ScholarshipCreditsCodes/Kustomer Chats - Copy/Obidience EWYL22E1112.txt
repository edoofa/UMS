03/12/23, 02:26 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL

04/12/23, 01:59 - Obidience EWYL22E1112: Spirit  of competition  is the idea that a competitive environment can be a positive  and motivating rather  than  just being about winnig or losing. I remember i used to play with  intelligent  friends everytime we had a test they would make that they are always  at the top of everyone.  So this had me under  pressure to work so hard and try to compete with them, i ended up being able to at the top of the class after every exams we had. So thannks to them i was able to get out of my comfort zone. The spirit of  competition is  good because  it helped to have the ability to discover  more things. It had me believe  that i am not a failure.  So i always make sure  that i cease every given opportunity , i don't  let it got to waste

Kindly excuse me for any inconvenience. I'd like to inform you that I encountered a technical glitch due to which last week's activity was shared again with you. I appreciate your understanding and patience in this matter.

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.
Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.
Best Regards
