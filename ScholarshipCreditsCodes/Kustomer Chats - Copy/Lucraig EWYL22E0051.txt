14/07/22, 16:59 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
How have you been all this while?
16/07/22, 07:37 - Lucraig EWYL22E0051: Hello sir..
16/07/22, 07:37 - Lucraig EWYL22E0051: I am fine and you
16/07/22, 18:26 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian,
Also, edoofian you have not been following *I am a proud edoofian*
I am your mentor *Ms.Riva* and I will help you cover everything as well.
But, my proud edoofian you need to be consistent and loyal for me to trust you.
You have to work with me and you have to prove yourself because only then I would be able to help.
18/07/22, 19:03 - Lucraig EWYL22E0051: Good morning

I am a Proud Edoofian
18/07/22, 19:04 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

18/07/22, 22:03 - Unknown: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e, you will be having 2 sessions on selected days. On Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
Sounds interesting, right?

25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

10/08/22, 23:07 - Unknown: Today, if you go to New York, you will find hundreds of places where they learn chanting. People go for one hour in the evenings to chanting classes. They chant ‘Om Namah Shivaya’, which is originally an Indian Chant’. Of course, they have a different pronunciation .In China, they say, ‘Ladhe Ladhe’ .


Chanting brings us many medical, psychological and social benefits. In initial stages of chanting it may be difficult to recognise the benefits we derive from chanting. In later stages too, knowing the benefits of chanting can restore our faith after we have experienced them.

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

12/08/22, 22:50 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian,
So yes, did you do a quick research about Raksha Bandhan?
You know I had an amazing day yesterday. I am very excited to tell you how it all went.
First I put a red spot on my brother's forehead, it is called 'teeka'. Then we stick some rice to that spot and after that, I tied a beautiful decorative rakhi (a thread or ribbon) on this wrist.
Sisters do that for the long life of their brothers and to that, the brothers promise to protect their sisters.
Later we have delicious sweets and exchanged presents.
15/08/22, 21:35 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

16/08/22, 22:58 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian, How was your long weekend?
Let me educate you about the Indian independence day which was yesterday due to which we had a long weekend!
Independence Day, in India, is a national holiday celebrated annually on August 15. Independence Day marks the end of British rule in 1947 and the establishment of a free and independent Indian nation. It also marks the anniversary of the partition of the subcontinent into two countries, India and Pakistan, which occurred at midnight on August 14–15, 1947.
Isn’t this interesting?
16/08/22, 22:58 - Unknown: Can you tell me about one such national event in Africa?
23/08/22, 18:24 - Lucraig EWYL22E0051: Hello mentor
