How are you?
I am happy to see the updates that you have shared with me. This week and our upcoming weeks are all about achieving our targets for the projects. Some students achieved it, and some are still working. I want that you take a moment to realize that only if you *work on the project--->*then only you will earn credits--->then only you will be able to financially assist yourself and your family while paying your college fees*.
We have to think big, and work really hard.

Let's connect in your scheduled session next, till then:
1) Follow the daily ritual
2) Share your pending lessons+weekend activity understanding
3) Projects Update
04/03/23, 23:25 - Saloni Rastogi: I completely agree with you and I believe experiences make us feel alive: there are times when we live our lives and slowly let them pass us by. This can happen when you stick to the same routine day and night without doing anything new. Going through life in the same 'state' can be tedious, but an unforgettable experience will awaken your mind and soul.

06/03/23, 21:19 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

06/03/23, 21:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy Monday _my proud edoofian_!
How are you?

In today's session, we will discuss:
1) Weekend activity
2) Projects
06/03/23, 21:39 - Saloni Rastogi: You know the opinions of both questions will completely differ with students but one thing that is common is that they strive to move ahead in life and take this motivation to next level. I have heard one quote on it, let me share it with you:
''One of the best ways to achieve career success is to keep assessing your performance. Don't wait for your annual appraisal – do it yourself. An ideal way to do this would be to identify quantifiable goals and set a timeline for achieving them. Start with setting short-term goals when you're new to a job.''

Your response just reflects how passionate you are about your journey in the EWYL Program with me.
06/03/23, 21:39 - Sindisiwe EWYL22E0892: yes ma'am I am eager to learn a lot from you
06/03/23, 22:17 - Saloni Rastogi: That's great!
06/03/23, 22:17 - Saloni Rastogi: We last talked about forming the group, did you form one?
06/03/23, 22:18 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me go ahead from where I last left, we discussed the step where we form the WhatsApp Group.
06/03/23, 22:18 - Saloni Rastogi: STEP 2: We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

As for attracting the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 5, and Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
06/03/23, 22:18 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to STUDY IN INDIA with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
06/03/23, 22:18 - Sindisiwe EWYL22E0892: maam the candidates I have been talking to learn at boarding schools so they haven't been available for the past few days
06/03/23, 22:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

And in a very similar manner, you can repeat the same process with the Form 5 students as well.
06/03/23, 22:19 - Saloni Rastogi: The method I am sharing with you is to increase the number of participants, by this way you will be able to target bigger audience.
06/03/23, 22:20 - Sindisiwe EWYL22E0892: thank you for the method ma'am let me do that just now
06/03/23, 22:20 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you form the group, then only I will be able to share some crucial information that can be shared with the students.
06/03/23, 22:20 - Sindisiwe EWYL22E0892: alright ma'am .what should I title the grou

24/04/23, 16:32 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian, ready for a motivational monday?

In a remote village, there lives a hardworking farmer who owns a farm. Over the years his grapery yields rich crops, and the farmer is very successful. He has three sons, who are young and energetic but never worry about working. As the farmer grows older, he begins to worry about his sons’ future.

Then he becomes very ill and feels that his death is coming soon. He calls his sons and says,

“Dear sons, I see my death approaching, but I want to share a secret before you all leave. These areas have treasure hidden inside. Dig the whole area after my death, to find it. ”

The old farmer died. The sons start digging for money without leaving any part of the field but nothing is found. In any case, digging their fields leads to healthier crops and results in higher incomes. These earnings make the sons realize what their father means.

What according to you is the moral of the story?

a. Hard work always pays off. The fruits of hard work are always sweet.
b. Be Selflessly kind
c. both a & b
24/04/23, 17:36 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you please share your weekend activity response and project update?
02/05/23, 15:46 - Sindisiwe EWYL22E0892: I am a proud Edoofian
02/05/23, 15:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.

Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell:

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges.
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
 3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
