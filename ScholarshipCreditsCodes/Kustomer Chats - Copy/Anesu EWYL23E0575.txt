05/10/23, 16:45 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofians,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning

12/10/23, 16:50 - Anesu EWYL23E0575: Belongingness is a fundamental human need. But why is the senses of belongingness important for success?
It's important because they is motivation and inspiration, support system and knowledge sharing
According to my research Motivation it's like a push that leads someone to make greater goals
Inspiration its something that pushs ur achievement in everything you do
12/10/23, 16:53 - Aditi Kapoor: Certainly, motivation and inspiration play essential roles in personal and professional development. They can serve as driving forces, providing the impetus needed to set and achieve greater goals.
12/10/23, 16:57 - Anesu EWYL23E0575: That's true
