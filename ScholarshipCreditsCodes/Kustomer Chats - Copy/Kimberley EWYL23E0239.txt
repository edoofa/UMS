How are you?

You sessions will be held on Monday and Thursday from 09:30-11:00 AM.
09/09/23, 17:31 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù
09/09/23, 17:33 - Saloni Rastogi: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter

3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.


If you are ready then we can beginüéâ
09/09/23, 17:41 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings, Proud Edoofians,

I trust you are in good spirits.

I trust this message finds you thriving. As we continue our academic journey, I encourage you to consider an opportunity that holds the potential to become a lucrative income source in the coming 3-4 years.

I firmly believe that among your assignments and projects, there lie gems with the power to generate income. Whether it's a distinctive skill, a project close to your heart, or an inventive concept, the time is ripe for us to embark on this exploration together. Your commitment and creativity may pave the way for a prosperous financial future.

During our Wednesday session, we learned about a wedding planner who leveraged his expertise to become a sales consultant. What's more, he now hosts his podcast, bolstering his income. I'm eager to hear your reflections on this subject.

Please do not hesitate to share any opportunities you believe you can pursue. We will delve deeper into your responses in our forthcoming discussions.

Here's to an exciting journey of discovery!

Warm regards,
TEAM EWYL!
