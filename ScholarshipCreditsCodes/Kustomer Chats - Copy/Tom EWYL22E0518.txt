11/10/22, 22:19 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, I am glad to hear that edoofian
11/10/22, 22:23 - Tom EWYL22E0518: Great.
Just to inform you that I'm working on the projects you gave me. Really working on them
11/10/22, 22:28 - Aditi Kapoor: Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say
11/10/22, 22:34 - Tom EWYL22E0518: So nice to hear about this. And  i can say with alot of pride that I am a proud Edoofian.
11/10/22, 22:36 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride.

May I know what have you understood from this message, what is the intention behind the same?
11/10/22, 22:59 - Tom EWYL22E0518: Greeting each other and mentioning that i am a proud Edoofian every morning is something that should be practised furthermore it fills me will alot of pride when i say so. That phrase can help me keep pushing for success and believing in myself so that i can be the voice of the voiceless and future leaders so that i can bring change in the community.
11/10/22, 22:59 - Aditi Kapoor: You know what will happen when you every morning are saying that you are a proud Edoofian, you are sending a message to the universe that you believe in who you are, you are dedicated to this student community, you are part of the ambitious Edoofians.
I hope that you will be performing this ritual everyday on the *EWYL DEDICATED LINE* at 9 AM With help of the above text, can you define who an Edoofian is?
