01/09/23, 15:55 - Victoria EWYL23E0492: I like the last one the most
01/09/23, 15:56 - Victoria EWYL23E0492: I ran out of battery
01/09/23, 16:03 - Ananya: Alright, so May I ask which of the three projects you liked the most?
01/09/23, 16:18 - Victoria EWYL23E0492: I like the last one the most
01/09/23, 16:18 - Victoria EWYL23E0492: The one of approaching school heads
01/09/23, 16:18 - Victoria EWYL23E0492: My network
01/09/23, 16:18 - Victoria EWYL23E0492: It's a bit weak
01/09/23, 16:19 - Ananya: Is it working now?
01/09/23, 16:20 - Victoria EWYL23E0492: It's on and off, hence l apologize if it seems like l am giving late replies
01/09/23, 16:20 - Ananya: That's alright, I understand. We can connect in our next session.
01/09/23, 16:20 - Victoria EWYL23E0492: No ma'am
01/09/23, 16:21 - Victoria EWYL23E0492: May we kindly please continue
01/09/23, 16:22 - Victoria EWYL23E0492: I was really looking forward to being in touch with you.
I would be really disappointed if we were to cut it short
01/09/23, 16:22 - Ananya: Great, so the last one how will you connect with the school principle, do you have any ideas?
01/09/23, 16:23 - Victoria EWYL23E0492: Was considering sending emails to various school heads in my area and if they are interested they will surely give feedback
01/09/23, 16:24 - Ananya: Well, -Let me share with you how our star performer for the last week-Loice did complete her targets.
She shared three schools and you know she got to know about them through Google.
She simply searched on Google like 'School nearby'/'School in Harare'/'School in Manicaland' and so on. She was able to yield results.
So even without physically visiting them, she got to know about them through Google, got their contact details, and after that got in touch with them Via WhatsApp.
3)  please reach out to all your friends, peers, cousins, neighbors, school mates, to get their School Head's contact details.
4)  visit schools in your province, physical visits can add another touch to the conversations and make them a lot more impactful.
01/09/23, 16:25 - Victoria EWYL23E0492: Thank you üôÇ
01/09/23, 16:28 - Ananya: This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success
‚ñ™Ô∏èVisiting schools physically can put a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, leadership quality, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear to present himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.
01/09/23, 16:28 - Ananya: .
01/09/23, 16:29 - Ananya: Dear proud Edoofian,
I have urgent work that requires my immediate attention, and as a result, I must conclude our session a bit earlier than planned. Let's reconnect in our next session.
01/09/23, 16:29 - Victoria EWYL23E0492: Thank you ma'am.
Have a lovely day
