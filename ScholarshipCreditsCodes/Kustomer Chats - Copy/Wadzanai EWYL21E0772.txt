12/07/22, 21:13 - Wadzanai EWYL21E0772: Hello
12/07/22, 21:15 - Unknown: Good Afternoon, Wadzanai
I hope that you are in good health and spirits
12/07/22, 21:15 - Unknown: I hope that we can start with our session now?
12/07/22, 21:16 - Wadzanai EWYL21E0772: Yes we can
12/07/22, 21:17 - Unknown: Great!
Wadzanai, May I know what did we discuss in our last session?
12/07/22, 21:24 - Wadzanai EWYL21E0772: We were talking about Unity
Schools which are connected with edoofa does to every edoofa student out of love and passion for advancement.
12/07/22, 21:29 - Unknown: Yes!
And I also shared a message related to the Proud Edoofian Message with you, right?
12/07/22, 21:30 - Wadzanai EWYL21E0772: Yes that i should write everyday that im proud edoofian
12/07/22, 21:31 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
12/07/22, 21:31 - Unknown: Yes, You are right.
Did you understand the motive behind writing this message?
12/07/22, 21:34 - Wadzanai EWYL21E0772: Yes but can explain further
12/07/22, 22:12 - Unknown: Can you please explain the motive to me?
13/07/22, 16:55 - Unknown: Good Morning, Wadznai
?
I hope that you are good health and spirits
13/07/22, 16:55 - Unknown: I hope that we are connected?
25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:35 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off

13/07/22, 21:18 - Unknown: Wadzanai, In the past few days, I have observed that we have started to deviate from the goals that we wanted to achieve when we started our EWYL Program.
The only reason for this is the lack of connectivity.
13/07/22, 21:20 - Wadzanai EWYL21E0772: Yes sir I haven't been connecting with you frequently
13/07/22, 21:21 - Unknown: What do you think might be the reason for this, Wadzanai?
13/07/22, 21:27 - Wadzanai EWYL21E0772: Network problems Sir
13/07/22, 21:35 - Unknown: Wadzanai, I hope that you are aware of the opportunities that we are missing out on due to this.
13/07/22, 21:36 - Unknown: My system shows that from the past 3 months, You haven't worked on the EWYL Projects.
Is that true?
13/07/22, 21:36 - Wadzanai EWYL21E0772: I'll make adjustments and try to be online everytime
13/07/22, 21:36 - Wadzanai EWYL21E0772: Yes
13/07/22, 21:42 - Unknown: I am glad to hear that.
Before we start our discussion on your Project Progress Form, May I know if you have gone through the video link that I shared with you in your EWYL Group last weekend?
13/07/22, 21:52 - Wadzanai EWYL21E0772: I don't have data bundles but I'll do so?
13/07/22, 22:01 - Unknown: Do not worry, Wadzanai.
I will soon share the offline video in your batch group.
Now, Can you please share Project Progress Form with me?

The deadline to make the submission is *Thursday* *6 PM*. Please make sure that you submit your response before that because the *Academic Board* keeps a very strict check on these things. 
 
The aim of this activity is to make you aware of the life journey of Patrice Motsepe and how you can inculcate his traits in your daily life.
