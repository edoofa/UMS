It is true that keeping your head down and working consistently during student life may seem boring to some. However, it is essential for achieving academic success and laying the foundation for a successful career. In today's fast-paced world, there are many distractions that can hinder a student's progress, making it even more important to stay focused and committed to their goals. Read the Wednesday wisdom lesson in detail to know about Consistency. We certainly will discuss in detail about your learnings in our upcoming scheduled session. 

Happy Learning
06/04/23, 21:32 - Unknown: Here I have shared the Wednesday Lesson, share with me your understanding of the lesson for today
06/04/23, 21:37 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0050: Consistency and hardwork are two essential things in one’s success
06/04/23, 21:39 - Unknown: That's right but can you elaborate a bit more?
06/04/23, 21:48 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0050: Consistency helps children in developing life skills. Consistency in practice,studies is the key to one’s academic success and build a strong foundation for career growth. In studying students can achieve their goals through consistency because they find spare time to revise whatever they would have done. Consistency in practice helps students with their muscle memory and also improves their technique which later on help students to perform at a higher level
06/04/23, 21:53 - Unknown: Absolutely! Consistency is crucial for children's development of life skills and for academic success. It's great to see that you recognize the value of consistency in practice and studies, as it provides students with spare time to revise and solidify their learning. Additionally, consistency in practice can help students develop muscle memory and improve their technique, which can contribute to their ability to perform at a higher level. Keep up the great work!

10/06/23, 16:25 - Unknown: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

This weekend we go back to the basics of EWYL with our 3 important keys! 
 Link: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtPOMh0pgPs/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA== 

Share in the comments if you have known this before and why is it important!!
10/06/23, 16:25 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0050: Okay let me do so
10/06/23, 16:42 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week’s Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better—together. It’s why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger—as successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!
10/06/23, 18:38 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0050: Working together ultimately helps us to broaden our knowledge in term of education. Success cannot be achieved in isolation. As students we are urging each other to work together and never give up until we achieve our goals. I am also making sure that I surround myself with positive minded people as a constant source of motivation and support on our journey towards success. These people encourage us to work hard and inspire us to reach higher goals. By witnessing achievements of other students and their determination, as an Edoofian  one should be motivated to push his/ her boundaries and strive for excellence. As a way of building a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community, I am kindly inspiring others to learn through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which is affordable. After sharing, I also urge others to also tell their friends about Edoofa so that our community ultimately develops. Also as a way of developing a strong network for myself I am also striving to achieve my goals through working tirelessly. Dedication and hard work can develop my abilities towards success. I am also interacting with those individuals who have made in life so that they can teach me how to achieve my dreams.  I am also surrounding myself with those people who never give up until they fulfill their dreams. These people also provide me with encouragement and motivation. The EWYL is also helping me a lot in bullying a strong community through interacting with different people while doing my projects.
