01/10/22, 17:35 - Unknown: Kudakwashe, I am very glad to inform you that Our Team has decided to feature you in this week's newsletter.
We were all very happy after seeing the photos and videos that you shared.

I would like to know your views on the below-given questions as these will also be shared along side your photos from the event:

1. What motivates you to go beyond academics and participate in these extra curricular activities?
2. Your Motivating message for all the edoofians who will be reading this newsletter.
01/10/22, 17:35 - Unknown: Also, Please share if you have some good quality pictures from the event
01/10/22, 18:18 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0615: *Reason behind something is a secret to the owner unless explored to those very keen individuals.To participate in extra-curricular activities like the World Tourism Day l partook academically has a great significance.l did extrinsic motivational participation which  was goal orientated in showing the love for African culture at large.The modelling l did was basically representing Africa as a whole and not my residing country only since l designed many cultures on my body.What do you gain from this?Try it some day, now l have a feeling of higher self esteem because l mapped my culture to different people,l gained social skills on top of my interpersonal skills like relationship building, aslo extended social networks in the sense that some individuals became more eager to know what is behind the type of culture i presented so they came and still coming to me digitally.Confidence at large when l managed to tackle some questions infront of the mass disolved stage fright and increase in class participations.l shared my experience and benefits to all the Edoofians hope it will be classically applied in your life time.Thank you.*
01/10/22, 18:22 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0615: *The message is try it now and get experience early.Do not be shy but have positive self image in all*

a)Target- no. of credits you want to earn in the month of October
b)How many projects can you work upon
c)Number of hours that you can devote to your projects
d)Name of the projects that you want to be a part of
e)Plan of action with your mentors

You are required to submit these answers by Today 6 PM. Let me know in case you face any challenges in Submitting the responses.

04/10/22, 17:12 - Unknown: Proud Edoofian, May I know if you have submitted the Saturday Activity.
04/10/22, 20:32 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0615: Good planning and hard work lead to prosperity because of organized process planning and eager for hard work.In some cases the results my take long because of the inflexibilities or else.However, one can say hasty shortcuts lead to poverty but the point is about risk.What l believe is that short cuts depends on results since they can lead to untold profit or loss all should be considered.All and above, good planning has a much good quality success promises than short cuts
04/10/22, 20:32 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0615: I actually l disagree to some extend.Shortcuts as l say its a risk management, there is also a chance to achieve a goal but is endowed with very minimum percentage of success.However to larger scale, shortcuts are doomed to fail because they lack quality planning
04/10/22, 20:32 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0615: Likewise from the first quote about good planning, a short cut is a longest distance between 2 points because it is full of uncertainities.No clear future in shortcuts because its prone and inevitable to fail at any time.Shortcuts have not fixed hope to attain an  achievement
04/10/22, 20:39 - Unknown: Yes, You are right, Kudakwashe.
I like that you always have your own opinion.
This is what I look for in a student.

So we know, a lot of you have been keeping busy these days with your exams and academic curriculum. And while we wish you all the luck for it, we don't want you to miss out on your learning and skill building. In today's lesson, we will discuss how to build our capacity to multitask, manage our time and prioritize our daily tasks in order to have it all. 

Let's dig right in, and understand how if you follow these steps, you will be able to manage your exams, assignments, extra curriculars, and your EWYL projects all at one go. After going through this, you must discuss the plan of action to execute these steps with your mentors.

Happy Learning!

Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!

12/07/22, 17:55 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0615: *Skills a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits*

Some of us *students* lack skills to gain more scholarship credits because we lack important experience on the projects.Failure of fast replies and negative  responses let us throw in the towel and wait for a miracle to happen by any chance oh thats very unfortunate and time loosing.Project like reaching out to students needs *patients* - one should be in a position to wait and arrive at such incoming questions pertaining the programme.Not patients only but being *analytic* too can help because one can waste time of which he\/she doesnt even feel to join the programme so these should work hand in glove to succeed.Secondly the project of reaching out to school heads\/principals need one to be *competent*- competence here means time conscious whereby if one is given a date and time for the appointments from schools he\/she doesn't need to miss it.During the discussion too one should be focused and committed thus showing enthusiasm to the programme.*Confidence* should be there to show the authenticity of what you are explaining and by this you cant be a failure at all.We go on to the project of companies.This project seems to be more complicated than the previously mentioned because it needs *good communication skills*-this skill is so vital in trying to propose invited companies.Grammar and layout should be formal that you dont waste time and hope of connections.Even if the communication skills are good then one should be *orientated*.Being orientated with the good communication skills can make us grow bigger with accepted invitations because you will be focused on the main agenda of why you requested for a connection.If you are oriented you will be directed to the purpose.I wish if l can be able to grasp these skills to earn more credits

12/07/22, 18:55 - Unknown: Kudakwashe, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.
This way you will always be recognized by the Academics Board for new projects.

14/07/22, 16:52 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

The aim of this activity is to make you aware of the life journey of Patrice Motsepe and how you can inculcate his traits in your daily life.
15/07/22, 22:54 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0615: *Patrice Motsepe*

The named man made his dreams came true even far beyond.His passion was motivated by his father's mini business of selling liquor to the miners and as a lawyer specialized in business law that pushed his enthusiasm.So in mining sector he realised that successful mines didn't have to be the large one's but rather any one, especially small ones that better managed his finances and operations.Again he got lucky to be partnered by the Chief Executive officer of Anglos gold and uranium division in gaining the shafts which were to be payed in installations but then wise to wish for a big turnarounds.Those strategies made him ranked Johannesburg Stock Exchange and titled the First Black Entrepreneur in South Africa and all the stated net worth of billion were inevitable through his strategic efforts in grasping opportunities.

[07\/23, 09:08] Vilsha: Good Morning Kudakwashe. 
You are not supposed to book a flight ticket a day before your departure, it is to be shared at least 48 hours in advance with us so that we can arrange for your arrival.

Now that there is no time for you to join the batch on 25th July, you will have to book the *reschedulable ticket* for the arrival date of 1st August 2022. Kindly keep a note that the flight should land in India on the 1st of August and not depart from there. Are you clear with this?
[07\/23, 09:09] runtown: Yes maam thank you so much
25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
