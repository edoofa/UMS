18/03/23, 21:30 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings *my proud edoofian*!

Here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!
18/03/23, 21:30 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know the progress so far with the community building project?

20/03/23, 20:35 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

20/03/23, 23:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Also I see that there is no update on the group with reference to the information sharing and addition of new people after Wednesday. May I know why?

How are you?
22/03/23, 00:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you please share the responses to questions shared above?
22/03/23, 14:45 - Sibonginkhosi EWYL22E0928: 1.High value can instill a sense of urgency
Sometimes, offering value can instill a sense of urgency in your customers. Whenever this is the case, work to maintain customer interest in ways that keep customer value high. Particularly for established businesses, customers are accustomed to the value they receive.
And I strongly agree with Henry Fords words.A customer might offer more than you expected from the service you had provided and worked well either.

2.you build relationships and acquire customers for life. With value comes happiness and loyalty. Stay focused on adding value, the rest will follow.

27/03/23, 19:28 - Saloni Rastogi: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

27/03/23, 21:26 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

As informed earlier, I was not available last week from Thursday to Friday and the organization was closed on Saturday and Sunday. So let's focus today's session solely on these three things:

1) Wednesday lesson + Weekend activity understanding
2) Whether you were able to complete last week's Projects targets?
3) What are the challenges you are facing in the projects?

Also, this week will be visiting our _Proud Indian Edoofians_ from Wednesday to Saturday. So, the sessions will be held at that time. And I will be very happy to share the updates of our visit with you as the days go by?

29/03/23, 00:55 - Sibonginkhosi EWYL22E0928: Great ?
29/03/23, 01:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for the delayed response, I was occupied in an internal meeting with the team with was to be attended as a priority about our visit starting tomorrow till Saturday.
As informed, no sessions will be held during this time and we will begin afresh from next week onwards where I will be sharing some crazy and interesting insights with you.
But this will only be done, we you will NOT MISS these *THREE THINGS*:
1) Timely submission of the Wednesday lesson and weekend activity
2) Daily following the ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', the absence of which can lead to not sharing of weekly lessons and activities with you
3) and most importantly, *PROGRESS ON PROJECTS*

I will be tracking the progress on _Monday_.
I completely know that these two weeks, we might not have dedicated discussions on the projects. So in my absence, I want that you think in-depth about *the project you are doing, revising the targets for the same, and completing it*.
I would really be emotional and happy that in a few months, many of the new edoofians will be joining our Indian family here. And honestly, I will be happier that we start preparing now for the future because growth is not measured in one day. We need to work hard consistently and dedicatedly.

Like I always say ‘1 step daily means 1 step UP. 0 step daily means 1 step DOWN’.
I trust you, just believe in yourself.
29/03/23, 01:05 - Saloni Rastogi: I have noted the form shared, keep going!
29/03/23, 01:23 - Sibonginkhosi EWYL22E0928: Thank you for the kind words ?
29/03/23, 19:13 - Sibonginkhosi EWYL22E0928: Good morning I am a proud EDOOFIAN
29/03/23, 19:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Hey everyone! You won't want to miss our latest post on the Edoofa Instagram page. Head over to our page to check it out, and feel free to share your own thoughts in the comments.","transform":"

30/03/23, 21:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Dear Students,
I hope this message finds you well. As your EWYL progresses, it is important that you stay up to date with your assignments and coursework. In order to ensure that you are able to move forward with the new lessons, I want to remind you that you must complete all of your previous assignments by the end of this week.

It is essential that you take the time to thoroughly review and complete your previous assignments. Doing so will not only help you to understand the lesson better, but it will also prepare you for the upcoming lessons. Failure to complete the previous assignments may result in a delay of the new lessons, and ultimately, it may impact your EWYL progress.

Therefore, I urge you to make the completion of your previous assignments a priority. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to seeing your completed assignments and to sharing the new lessons with you soon.

Best regards,
Team EWYL","transform":"

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and let you know that I was overwhelmed by the response from students during my recent university visit. While I was thrilled to see so many of my students, I am currently working on performance evaluation of each one of them. Hence I would like to inform you that I will not be able to attend to your queries during the weekend that is tomorrow and day after. 

However, I would like to assure you that I will be available to connect with you in our upcoming session on Monday\/Tuesday. Please make sure you mark your calendars and plan to attend that session so we can address any questions or concerns you may have and proceed with our discussions then.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. I am looking forward to our next session and I hope to see you all there.

Till then take care and don’t forget to work on your pending activities from this month.","transform":"
