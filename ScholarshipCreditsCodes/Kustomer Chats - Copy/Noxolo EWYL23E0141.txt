Let's begin with our today's session.
24/08/23, 13:21 - Noxolo EWYL23E0141: Yes we can begin
24/08/23, 13:22 - Aditi Kapoor: So, we'll be beginning our new journey toward this earning and learning opportunity and I want you to commence with lots of enthusiasm and willingness to work hard to achieve your dreams as you wanted to build a community and I highly think of this as a great aspiration for giving back to the society and I am sure that this EWYL journey will not only help you to earn Scholarship credits but also upskill you and make you stand out from others and I want to make sure that you excel in all aspects of this journey.

24/08/23, 13:31 - Aditi Kapoor: This is great!
So Noxolo, may I know your updates on the projects that you are currently working on?
24/08/23, 13:41 - Noxolo EWYL23E0141: Okay l managed to get connected to two school heads one of them said that he is occupied till 30 September and l have not received response from the other one.
24/08/23, 13:42 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, I understand.
And what about the community-building project?
24/08/23, 13:45 - Noxolo EWYL23E0141: I'm not aware of it
24/08/23, 13:46 - Noxolo EWYL23E0141: Please explain about it

In this project, you shall approach your friends, brothers and sisters, and even classmates willing to study abroad and share your journey with Edoofa and your experience with your Mentor and counselor. Those who wish to apply will consult their parents so that they apply. I will share posters with you so that you can show them an offline application form they will fill out.

Subject Combination in A Level:-
Current Class (L5 / L6 / U6):

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:-
August 2023 or August 2024
24/08/23, 13:49 - Aditi Kapoor: And #2 ‚Äì Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here‚Äôs a quick recap of what‚Äôs the opportunity for you here-
1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university √† you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
24/08/23, 13:52 - Noxolo EWYL23E0141: Okay noted
24/08/23, 13:52 - Aditi Kapoor: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
24/08/23, 13:53 - Noxolo EWYL23E0141: Alright
24/08/23, 13:54 - Aditi Kapoor: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
*STEP 1*: You‚Äôre supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*

For eg: In your case, it will be-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*
24/08/23, 13:54 - Aditi Kapoor: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
24/08/23, 13:54 - Aditi Kapoor: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
24/08/23, 13:54 - Aditi Kapoor: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
24/08/23, 14:02 - Noxolo EWYL23E0141: So do l connect with students from schools which have not been connected to Edoofa only or from any school?
24/08/23, 14:05 - Aditi Kapoor: You can connect to any student who is interested in coming to India to study for their higher education.
24/08/23, 14:05 - Aditi Kapoor: And get this applicaton form filled.
24/08/23, 14:06 - Noxolo EWYL23E0141: Okay understood
24/08/23, 14:28 - Aditi Kapoor: That concludes my input for today! 

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
24/08/23, 14:31 - Noxolo EWYL23E0141: Okay ma'am
