Hello my proud hope you are doing well,. We are back with another Wednesday wisdom. I am sure you will agree to the fact that Attitude plays a major role in our day-to-day life. It is also a waste of time if the proper attitude and effective abilities are not developed. In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we discuss a crucial character quality that everyone should work on and make sure they have mastered the right attitude. Once you have read the full lesson, We will be having the discussion concerning the same in our next session. Write down if you have any questions or key observations from the lesson.

This week, we discovered that people who are successful don't hold the world responsible for their failures. They accept accountability for their own choices and results. To develop this mindset of taking responsibility for everything and avoiding the blame game takes time and focus. As your Saturday Assignment your are required to write a short write up, on the growth mindset of successful people and how will you make sure you develop the same mindset. The word limit for this assignment is 150-200 words. Kindly make sure you follow the word limit strictly, any responses less than the minimum word limit will not be marked.
You are required to submit the same by Monday 10 AM  on the dedicated EWYL line.

Happy learning !

25/07/22, 03:16 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

There are 2 questions in it, you must answer them now.
 I am waiting for your answer and then I will share my understanding \/ opinion about them.

27/07/22, 03:04 - Mercilyn EWYL22E0191: 1) To be an successful Edoofan like other students l would have to work hard and also respect the mentors because many of my age wanted this scholarship but l had an opportunity do l must use it wisely. I want to be an example of good by giving my fellow Zimbabweans information about Edoofa and also maintain its standard A+ credits thereby making Edoofa famous and always at top.


2) In order to create oneness l should encourage other Edoofans to take to heart every work that is given to them and apart from that they should feel proud of being part and parcel of Edoofa
27/07/22, 17:11 - Jasmine Kaur: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
Wake up and seize the day!
27/07/22, 17:12 - Jasmine Kaur: To add to your understanding Mercy,
Actions that are based on the principles of Oneness are rewarding in the sense that they fill us with happiness and joy, whether or not you get your desired results. Just the act of committing to the effort makes us feel connected to everything and can help heal isolation, loneliness, and helplessness.
Hence in edoofa you can show your commitment and efforts by working on the projects we have, also *as a mentor I understand that projects have a dependency on others for example if some school head is responding or not, whether a company is interested or not etc but for activities and lessons you should keep the focus on top to shine in the community*
27/07/22, 20:42 - Mercilyn EWYL22E0191: Thank you ma'am
27/07/22, 21:19 - Jasmine Kaur: You will be getting a fun filled *Wednesday lesson* today,

27/07/22, 21:52 - Mercilyn EWYL22E0191: Okay ma'am
27/07/22, 22:01 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my proud Edoofian, we are back with our Wednesday lesson.

I realised as soon as I started reading this lesson that most of my students needed to learn and grasp this. One person succeeding and one failing depends solely on how effectively they manage their time. Try to comprehend and apply the measures discussed in the lesson to your everyday life. I'll be here to help you, so that you can focus on learning how to manage your time effectively. In our following session, please explain in detail what you learned from the lesson.Also, do not forget to send *I am a proud edoofian* tomorrow.

Happy learning
