20/10/22, 18:47 - Unknown: Great!
20/10/22, 18:48 - Unknown: Yesterday because I was discussing the Testimonial Task with many students, I refrained from sharing the Wednesday Lesson because I thought it would be too much information for one session.

Therefore I am sharing the Wednesday Lesson with you Today.

Also, Since, I am sharing this one day late, I am extending the deadline to Saturday at 9 AM from Friday at 6 PM.
20/10/22, 18:49 - Unknown: Hello, My Proud Edoofian.


In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.


This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.


I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.


Happy Learning.
