27/03/23, 21:57 - Jasmine Kaur: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

28/03/23, 21:55 - Jasmine Kaur: Francine dear, are you following the ritual of coming to the EWYL Line every day and chanting I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN?
28/03/23, 21:57 - Francine EWYL22E1258: Yes I am
28/03/23, 21:58 - Francine EWYL22E1258: From the attachment you sent my assignment is supposed to involve me reflecting on the the topic and explaining to you my perspective of wealth creation right?
28/03/23, 22:00 - Jasmine Kaur: I think there is some confusion dear. You have to come to the EWYL Line every day and say that *I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN*.

Most of the information is given to only those students who are coming to the EWYL LIne every day.

3. Mindset and Habits: Wealth creation is not just about having a financial plan; it is also about cultivating the mindset and habits that will help you achieve your goals. In this section, identify the mindset and habits that are necessary for financial success. Explain how you will cultivate these qualities in yourself and develop strategies to overcome any obstacles that may arise.

01/04/23, 21:27 - Francine EWYL22E1258: Wealth acquired and used in a right way does not only create a path of success but also fulfillment based on its use.in order to achieve financial success one has to set goals, develop a financial plan and have a mindset and habits needed to achieve it.
Setting goal for financial success is a huge task because the goals you set keep you focused these goals should be clear and achievable. Long term goes give you an insight of things you can achieve over a long period of time my long term goals are paying off a mortgage, investing in a company, saving for my families such as money for education, saving for my retirement, paying of debt, improving my credit score too.
When making these goals one has to be specific,measurable, achievable, relevant and timely. Do not save for things you want but rather need.
Short term goals are achieved over or within a short period of time  my short term goals are avoiding debt, finding a source of income,creating a budget and spending with it’s range,learn more about personal finances.

My financial plan will state on how I plan to achieve my goals, first and foremost it will involve my money elevation such as my income, spending l, debt and most important savings my expectations will not miss in this plan. To ensure that all that is in my financial plan is achieved I will come up with a budget and a system of where half the salary will be spent on needs 50%, 20% will be saved, 30% invested or spent on wants! 
An income source will be created other than my job, come up with a business,
It’s an awesome idea to come up with ways of saving such as packing your own lunch than buying everyday at work or school, spending money to save by purchasing durable products, setting savin goals, save money to eliminate debts and avoid debts. Another best way to save is making us of banks and apps that help you follow your saving goals.
When it comes to investing one has to pick which strategies suit himself\/herself 
One has
