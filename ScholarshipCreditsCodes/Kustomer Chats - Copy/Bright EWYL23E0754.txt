04/11/23, 11:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Bright!
I hope this message finds you well. I would like to extend my sincere apologies for the inconvenience I may have caused over the past two days.

On Thursday, I experienced an unexpected deterioration in my health, which required me to be urgently taken to my home. Unfortunately, this left me in a situation where I was unable to inform you about my absence from our session.

Then, on Friday, I had the obligation to attend a grand orientation event at one of our partner universities. Given the importance of this event, I found it necessary to be present.

Once again, I deeply apologize for any disruption my absence may have caused, and I assure you that I value our commitments and responsibilities. I am committed to making up for any missed work or obligations in the coming days.
04/11/23, 11:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Thank you for your understanding and patience during this time. Please let me know if there is anything specific I need to address or catch up on.
04/11/23, 11:48 - Bright EWYL23E0754: Ok thus not a problem
04/11/23, 11:48 - Bright EWYL23E0754: There is nothing specific sor far
04/11/23, 12:14 - Saloni Rastogi: That is alright but you did not share your response to the Wednesday Wisdom, did you go through it?
04/11/23, 12:42 - Bright EWYL23E0754: Yes i go through it
04/11/23, 12:58 - Bright EWYL23E0754: From Wednesday Wisdom I learnt a lot which includes the following,,first I learnt that, journalling provides a dedicated space to explore and understand one's thoughts and emotions,,,it can also lead to heightened self awareness.I also learnt that journals cab serve as personal historical records, allowing individuals to look back on their life journey, experiences and personal growth. And on my view i see journalling as a good thing to practice.
04/11/23, 13:00 - Bright EWYL23E0754: I have learnt a lot but these are the few that i can list
04/11/23, 13:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

As part of your Saturday Activity, I encourage each one of you to dedicate some time to journaling for just one day. Let your thoughts flow freely onto the pages, expressing your feelings, ideas, and observations. Take this opportunity to delve deep within yourself and discover what truly matters to you. Your journal can be a canvas for your dreams, fears, aspirations, and daily experiences. When sharing your journal, feel free to discuss your insights, challenges, and any personal growth you may have experienced through the process.

I believe that this activity will not only enhance your writing skills but also nurture your emotional intelligence and self-awareness. I look forward to reading and discussing your journal entries during our upcoming session. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Happy journaling!

08/11/23, 13:39 - Bright EWYL23E0754: Today was a rollercoaster of emotions. I woke up feeling down and a bit overwhelmed, but I tried to take things one step at a time. I accomplished a few small tasks, and that made me feel a little better. But, as time moves , I started feeling anxious again. I took a moment to pause and breathe. I decided to reframe my thoughts and focus on the positive things in my life. I felt a bit better, and then I started setting some small goals for myself,
 My first goal is to exercise for at least 30 minutes each day. Exercise is important for my physical and mental health, and it's something I enjoy. My second goal is to make more time for reading each day. Reading helps me learn new things and relax my mind. Finally, my third goal is to spend quality time with friends and family. Connecting with the people I love is essential for my well-being.
