21/10/23, 14:21 - Unknown: Greetings of the day, Shumirai!☀️

We're excited to announce a new and inspiring opportunity for all of you! As part of our commitment to fostering a culture of learning and personal development through our Saturday Activity, we are launching the "Hard Work and Commitment Story week.”
Here's how it works:
*We invite each of you to share a story you've heard or would love to write on the timeless concepts of hard work and unwavering commitment to a goal. This is your chance to let your imagination soar and craft a tale that truly resonates with the values of determination and dedication*
Whether it's a personal experience, a fable passed down through generations, or a fictional narrative, we want to hear your stories. Let your creativity shine, and show us how hard work and steadfast commitment can lead to remarkable achievements.
Draft your story and submit it before our upcoming session. We will have the best stories featured in our student community for others to read and be inspired by.
So, start writing, and let your imagination run wild. Share your stories with us, and together, we can celebrate the values that drive success.
We look forward to reading your stories and sharing your creativity and wisdom.

Best regards,
Team EWYL!

They can help us achieve our goals and make our dreams a reality. But what does it really take to have this kind of unwavering commitment? And what does it feel like when we reach our goals?                                                    There was a man by the name Steve, who always dreamed of becoming a professional musician. From a young age, he was passionate about music and worked tirelessly to improve his skills. Despite facing many setbacks and challenges, he never gave up on his dream. He worked odd jobs and practiced late into the night, eventually landing a gig at a local club. Over time, his hard work and dedication began to pay off, and he was offered a record.Steve faced many obstacles on his journey to becoming a musician, but he never gave up. He continued to believe in himself and his abilities, even when others doubted him. Steve's love for music was what kept him going through the hard times, and it was ultimately what led to his success. Passion and dedication are essential ingredients for achieving any goal.Steve's story is an inspiring example of how hard work and unwavering commitment can lead to success.
