07/10/23, 16:48 - Unknown: Greetings my lovely student,

Happy Saturday! We hope you're all feeling fantastic today. As part of our Saturday activity, we have something special in store for you that's all about celebrating our Edoofian pride!

Today's activity is all about showcasing your pride as an Edoofian. We want you to flaunt your badge of honor, that feeling of being a proud Edoofian, and record a short video saying, "I am a proud Edoofian, and here's one reason why." This is your opportunity to share your Edoofian spirit and what makes you proud to be part of our community.

We can't wait to see your videos and hear your stories of Edoofian pride! Remember, this activity is all about celebrating our unique journeys and what makes our community so special‚≠ê

Best regards,
TEAM EWYL
