11/12/23, 15:56 - Saloni Rastogi: Hazel, I loved the idea that you shared above on how to do the community building project but I feel so amused that from 9th to 10th December, you did not follow the daily ritual on the EWYL Line as a result of which, you did not receive the Saturday activity.

13/12/23, 15:55 - Saloni Rastogi: *Happy Wednesday*üåª

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into ‚Äì the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work ‚Äì a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.üåü

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.ü§ù

14/12/23, 15:59 - Hazel EWYL22E0944: I understood that honesty and hardwork are the two pillars of hard work. These two help with not only the academics but also with personal and proffessional growth. Honesty fosters an environment of open communication which controbutes to the overall learning experience within a college student.
I also understood that being hardworking means setting goals for yourself  managing time efficiently and putting in the effort required for one to succeed. More hardwork leads to success and the habits cultivated through hardwork are discipline, resiliance and determination only to mention a few

14/12/23, 16:17 - Saloni Rastogi: I appreciate your emphasis on the importance of honesty and hard work as fundamental pillars for both academic and personal/professional growth. Your recognition of honesty fostering open communication and contributing to the overall college learning experience is insightful.
