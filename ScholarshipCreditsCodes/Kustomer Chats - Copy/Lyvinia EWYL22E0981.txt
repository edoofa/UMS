North Star Metric is a key business metric that reflects the core value a product delivers to its customers. It's a single, actionable metric that aligns all efforts towards achieving long-term growth. Let us learn about in greater detail, read the lesson carefully and we will connect in our upcoming scheduled session.

The feedback we have received from some of you on this week’s Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.
As part of this week’s Saturday Activity, you are required to share your written submission on : 
What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?
There is no word limit, so feel free to express your understanding in detail. The second answer requires some mental work, so sit with yourself, introspect, and share your honest answer with your mentor. 
Let this activity play an important role in your personal goal setting. We will connect soon in our upcoming session. 
Till then, happy learning and happy growing!

Ready for your dose of Wednesday wisdom?

I want to ask you a question: Have you Despised Wealth?

The concept of wealth has been a topic of much debate and discussion for centuries. While some view wealth as a means to achieve success and fulfillment, others may view it with suspicion or even disdain. However, it is important to understand that ethical wealth creation is possible and can be a force for good in the world. In this regard, it is essential to examine our own perspectives on wealth creation and consider how they may impact our relationship with money, status, and success.

Read today’s lesson in detail and let's have a detailed discussion in our upcoming session. I am sure today’s lesson will lead to many fruitful discussions and will assist you in planning better for your journey toward wealth creation.

REMINDER Make sure to complete this activity before our tomorrow's session and submit it when I will ask for it.
WE HAVE OUR SESSION TODAY FROM 8:30 am to 10:30 am
Kindly be on time!

I am pleased to observe that a majority of you comprehended well, the message  that was conveyed in this week's Wednesday wisdom. It brought me great joy to go through student’s perspectives on wealth creation and the mindset essential for embarking on this path.

I have a special Saturday assignment for you. The objective of this assignment is to help you understand the steps you can take to prepare yourself for wealth creation. The assignment will encourage you to identify their goals, develop a financial plan, and cultivate the mindset and habits needed to achieve financial success.

Here are some instructions to make it easy for you to work on this assignment:
1. Goal Setting: The first step towards wealth creation is to set clear and achievable goals. In this section, write down your short-term and long-term financial goals. Explain how each goal will contribute to your overall financial success.
2. Financial Planning: A financial plan is a roadmap that outlines how you will achieve your financial goals. In this section, develop a comprehensive financial plan that includes strategies for budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management. Identify the resources you will need to achieve your financial plan and explain how you will access them.
3. Mindset and Habits: Wealth creation is not just about having a financial plan; it is also about cultivating the mindset and habits that will help you achieve your goals. In this section, identify the mindset and habits that are necessary for financial success. Explain how you will cultivate these qualities in yourself and develop strategies to overcome any obstacles that may arise.
4. Conclusion: In this section, summarize your findings and discuss the importance of preparing yourself for wealth creation. Reflect on what you have learned throughout the assignment and discuss how you will apply these principles in your own life.

03/04/23, 19:43 - Jasmine Kaur: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

I hope this message finds you well. As your EWYL progresses, it is important that you stay up to date with your assignments and coursework. In order to ensure that you are able to move forward with the new lessons, I want to remind you that you must complete all of your previous assignments by the end of this week.

It is essential that you take the time to thoroughly review and complete your previous assignments. Doing so will not only help you to understand the lesson better, but it will also prepare you for the upcoming lessons. Failure to complete the previous assignments may result in a delay of the new lessons, and ultimately, it may impact your EWYL progress.

Therefore, I urge you to make the completion of your previous assignments a priority. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to seeing your completed assignments and to sharing the new lessons with you soon.

Best regards,
Team EWYL","transform":"
