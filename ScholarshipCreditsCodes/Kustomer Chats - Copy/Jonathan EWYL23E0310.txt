These things help one to be exposed to the environment inorder to be familiar with the people and it is easy to gain information if I have a positive relationship with the people am interacting with. It is also important to be responsible for my community. I have to know my community and help out where ever I can.

27/07/23, 13:35 - Jonathan EWYL23E0310: Actually, I have been like that ever since I was little
27/07/23, 13:37 - Aditi Kapoor: Be comfortable and just calm down and speak like you are talking to a friend or your near and dear ones, and I believe that if you start approaching and talking to new people, it gives you a confidence boost. 
And most importantly self-appreciation, as if you really love yourself, you would be dripping with confidence.
27/07/23, 13:38 - Aditi Kapoor: And for start, you try practicing daily, start small maybe a one-minute video, but start practicing, this will take you a long way.

With time and dedication, you'll become more confident in front of the camera.
