23/08/23, 17:55 - Tadiwa EWYL23E0496: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am Tadiwa Mabhena and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Tadiwa EWYL 23E0496
23/08/23, 18:01 - Tadiwa EWYL23E0496: Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am Tadiwa Mabhena and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Tadiwa EWYL 23E0496
24/08/23, 13:02 - Tadiwa EWYL23E0496: I am a proud Edofian
24/08/23, 13:05 - Ananya: Greetings, my Proud Edoofain!
How are you doing today?
24/08/23, 13:08 - Tadiwa EWYL23E0496: I am doing better and you
24/08/23, 13:09 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.
24/08/23, 13:13 - Tadiwa EWYL23E0496: Noted
24/08/23, 13:13 - Ananya: Now, I believe it is important to understand your priorities and interests. Therefore, I want to begin by asking which of those three EWYL projects, you liked the most?
24/08/23, 13:14 - Tadiwa EWYL23E0496: The third project
24/08/23, 13:15 - Ananya: That's amazing! So do you have any plans for doing it so gracefully!
24/08/23, 13:16 - Tadiwa EWYL23E0496: Yes
24/08/23, 13:19 - Ananya: Would you like to tell me those?
24/08/23, 13:24 - Tadiwa EWYL23E0496: Okay l have researched on different best schools in Zimbabwe 
I am going to start with the schools near George Stark High School for example Lord Malvern High School Harare High School and St Peters High School
24/08/23, 13:25 - Ananya: That's brilliant Tadiwa! I am impressed!
24/08/23, 13:28 - Tadiwa EWYL23E0496: Thank you very much
24/08/23, 13:29 - Ananya: This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success
‚ñ™Ô∏èVisiting schools physically can put a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, leadership quality, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear to present himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.
24/08/23, 13:29 - Ananya: .
24/08/23, 13:49 - Tadiwa EWYL23E0496: That's great
24/08/23, 13:50 - Ananya: Indeed, I want you to adopt this approach and connect with as many schools as you want. You know, you can also print some application forms and distribute it among the students.
24/08/23, 13:50 - Tadiwa EWYL23E0496: I wish to do that also
24/08/23, 13:52 - Tadiwa EWYL23E0496: Okay ma'am thank you very much
24/08/23, 13:55 - Ananya: Now, Tadiwa, in order to maintain a specific credit balance in your account and ensure your active participation, I will create a personalized target table for you. Before doing that, I need to evaluate your performance. To accomplish this, I'm assigning you a small target, and I hope you will be able to excel at it. Are you up for this?
24/08/23, 13:56 - Tadiwa EWYL23E0496: Yes
24/08/23, 14:01 - Ananya: You have to submit 2 community-building forms with me by Saturday evening, is that alright?

I really appreciate
28/08/23, 13:51 - Ananya: -Let me share with you how our star performer for the last week-Loice did complete her targets.
She shared three schools and you know she got to know about them through Google.
She simply searched on Google like 'School nearby'/'School in Harare'/'School in Manicaland' and so on. She was able to yield results.
So even without physically visiting them, she got to know about them through Google, got their contact details, and after that got in touch with them Via WhatsApp.
3)  please reach out to all your friends, peers, cousins, neighbors, school mates, to get their School Head's contact details.
4)  visit schools in your province, physical visits can add another touch to the conversations and make them a lot more impactful.
28/08/23, 13:54 - Tadiwa EWYL23E0496: Thank you ma'am
