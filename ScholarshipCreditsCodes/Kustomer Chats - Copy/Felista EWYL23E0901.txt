01/12/23, 16:53 - Felista EWYL23E0901: Two headmasters but non have responded yet
01/12/23, 16:58 - Unknown: If you've reached out to two headmasters and haven't received a  response,there are a few steps you can take  to follow up:
01/12/23, 16:59 - Felista EWYL23E0901: They usually respond over the weekend
01/12/23, 16:59 - Unknown: Wait a Reasonable Time: Sometimes, people are busy, and it may take a bit of time for them to respond. Wait for a reasonable period, considering their schedule and responsibilities.

Send a Polite Follow-Up Email: If a significant amount of time has passed, consider sending a polite follow-up email. Express your continued interest and restate the purpose of your initial communication. Keep the tone respectful and understanding.

Check Contact Information: Ensure that you have the correct contact information for the headmasters. Sometimes, messages may not reach their intended recipients due to incorrect email addresses or other contact details.

Phone Follow-Up: If email doesn't work, consider making a phone call. A brief and professional call can sometimes be more effective in getting attention.
01/12/23, 16:59 - Unknown: Consider Alternative Contacts: If there's a delay in receiving responses, you might explore contacting other staff members, such as assistant principals or administrative staff, who might be able to direct your inquiry to the appropriate person.

Visit in Person: If possible and appropriate, you may also consider visiting the schools in person. Face-to-face communication can sometimes be more impactful.

Be Persistent but Respectful: While persistence is essential, it's equally important to be respectful. People may have various reasons for delays, and understanding those factors can help in your approach.
01/12/23, 16:59 - Unknown: Remember, communication delays can happen for various reasons, and it's  crucial to maintain a professional and patient approach as you follow  up.

I was asked to contact the headmasters of my previous school and indeed I contacted them. I used both normal messages and via WhatsApp.  Both have not responded so far but I I'm still eager to get a response from them. I have learned that waiting for a response requires patience as people have different schedules and may respond at different times.
05/12/23, 16:45 - Unknown: Your initiative in contacting the headmasters demonstrates your proactive approach and dedication.

Understanding Response Time:It's insightful that you recognize the importance of patience in waiting for responses.

Mention your eagerness to discuss the potential benefits of the Edoofa scholarship program.

Let's kick off today's session with a quote from the tech maestro, Sundar Pichai:
"Success is not about the destination. It's about the journey."

üåü What it Means:
Imagine your favorite video game. Sure, finishing a level is awesome, but the real joy? It's in navigating the challenges, learning new skills, and enjoying the process.

12/12/23, 15:55 - Unknown: I am good too, thank you so much for asking.
12/12/23, 15:55 - Unknown: Let us now shift our attention, give me an honest update on the project work.
Have you started to work on both the Community Building and African School Reforms Project. ?

How many students have you interacted with so far? How are you planning to increase the number of students and the student application forms?


Answer the question explaining the progress of each project one by one.
12/12/23, 16:00 - Felista EWYL23E0901: Yes I have started working on the projects so far I have spoken to three teachers but no students yet.  As most are still in schools and have no access to phones in schools. But they are due to close next week.

I plan on creating a group with the school so that the school can add both parents and children as well as Edoofa there for easy access to the application and thereby growing it out
12/12/23, 16:16 - Unknown: Great to hear that you've started the project and have already spoken to three teachers‚Äîthat's a promising start! Your plan to create a group with the school is a strategic move. Here are some personalized tips to guide you further:
Collaborate with Teachers:Continue engaging with teachers and seek their support in spreading the word among students. Teachers can be powerful advocates and help you connect with more students.

Plan a Smooth Transition:As schools are due to close, plan a smooth transition for when students have access to their phones. Consider creating anticipation or excitement around the upcoming group.
12/12/23, 16:17 - Unknown: Highlight Parental Involvement:Emphasize the involvement of parents in the group. Parents play a crucial role in decision-making, and having them in the group can provide a platform for them to ask questions and understand the benefits of Edoofa.

Create Engaging Content:When you create the group, share engaging content about Edoofa. This could include success stories, testimonials, or brief information about the opportunities available. Make it visually appealing and easy to understand.
12/12/23, 16:17 - Unknown: You can also share the following posters.

Provide Clear Instructions:Clearly instruct parents and students on how to access and fill out the application. Make the process simple and straightforward, ensuring that everyone understands the steps involved.

Express Your Vision:When introducing the group, express your vision for creating a supportive community. Share why you believe in Edoofa and how it can positively impact both students and parents.

12/12/23, 16:20 - Unknown: What are the challenges that you are facing while working on the project? What is it exactly that is hindering you from submitting the application forms for students and for schools? we will figure it all out and will come up with possible solutions.
12/12/23, 16:22 - Felista EWYL23E0901: Most students need parents to make decisions for them as a result most parents seem to be afraid to take up this opportunity because of the devaluation in our country
12/12/23, 16:28 - Unknown: emphasizing the authenticity of the organization and the range of scholarship options is a powerful approach. Let's shift the focus:
Organization's Credibility:Highlight the organization's history, accreditation, and success stories of students who have benefited from its programs. This builds trust and underscores the authenticity of the opportunities offered.

Transparency in Processes:Emphasize the transparency in the application and selection processes. Share details about how students are chosen for scholarships, ensuring that it's a fair and merit-based system.

Diverse Scholarship Options:Showcase the range of scholarship options available, varying from 50% to 100%. This diversity ensures that students with different financial backgrounds can find a suitable and accessible opportunity.

Success Stories of Scholarship Recipients:Share success stories of students who have received scholarships and the positive impact it has had on their lives. Personal narratives provide a powerful testimony to the genuine support the organization offers.
12/12/23, 16:30 - Unknown: Interactive Information Sessions:Organize virtual information sessions where prospective students and parents can interact directly with current scholarship recipients. This allows for real-time questions and authentic experiences.

Accessible Support Channels:Communicate the availability of support channels for prospective students and parents to seek clarification. Knowing that there's assistance available reinforces the commitment to transparency and authenticity.
