08/12/23, 15:43 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!

Hope you're doing well!
I'm excited to catch up with you. Let's chat about the Wednesday lesson ‚Äì what stuck with you the most?

And, of course, I'm curious about how things are going with the projects.
Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and checking out your progress! üòä
08/12/23, 15:48 - Rivhathihi EWYL23E0275: right now lm trying to communicate with the head masters
08/12/23, 15:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Now, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?
08/12/23, 15:53 - Rivhathihi EWYL23E0275: yes
08/12/23, 15:55 - Saloni Rastogi: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?

Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.

Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
08/12/23, 15:55 - Rivhathihi EWYL23E0275: 1. Solusi Adventist High Schoo. Yes , the school is connected with Edoofa

2. l would like to share exciting information about the Edoofa program one of the reasons l am a Edoofian. 
Studying the Edoofa program has its own advantages such us scholarships,  gaining knowledge and skills about certain projects. The program teaches students about awareness   

3. Matebeleland South in Zimbabwe
08/12/23, 15:59 - Saloni Rastogi: TODAY, I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.
08/12/23, 16:00 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know if you have the other School Head‚Äôs Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.

There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head‚Äôs Contact.

Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head‚Äôs Contact.
08/12/23, 16:00 - Rivhathihi EWYL23E0275: l clearly understand
08/12/23, 16:00 - Rivhathihi EWYL23E0275: no.... l do not have them
08/12/23, 16:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Will you be able to find the contacts?
08/12/23, 16:14 - Rivhathihi EWYL23E0275: no.... l will have to visit the school's offices
08/12/23, 16:40 - Saloni Rastogi: There are two ways to work on the African School Reform project:
08/12/23, 16:40 - Saloni Rastogi: A. *Connecting with school virtually*-

‚ñ™Ô∏è In this you would have to find the contacts of the schools through your peers, friends, neighbors, cousins, school teachers, and school heads.
‚ñ™Ô∏èThen introduce yourself to them professionally and state the purpose of connecting with them along with their available time.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share information about Edoofa that I will be providing you in order to help them understand the Program deeply and with more clarity.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share the school form with them, and if they are interested in connecting with us, then our aim should be to get the form filled.
08/12/23, 16:41 - Saloni Rastogi: B. *Visiting schools physically*


‚ñ™Ô∏è Now by this, as it clearly says, you have to visit schools nearby and inform them about Edoofa.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Visiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏è With this, you will surely gain a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, overcome the fear of presenting yourself and your family Edoofa, spontaneously in front of anyone at any point.
08/12/23, 16:41 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share what do you think about this?
08/12/23, 16:54 - Rivhathihi EWYL23E0275: l think this is a good way of connecting with other school heads as it helps me gain confidence and compelling skills
09/12/23, 14:14 - Rivhathihi EWYL23E0275: good day Ms Saloni
09/12/23, 14:14 - Rivhathihi EWYL23E0275: l am a proud Edoofian

09/12/23, 19:00 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!
