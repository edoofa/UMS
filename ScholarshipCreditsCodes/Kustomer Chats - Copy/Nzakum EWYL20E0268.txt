25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

03/08/22, 21:43 - Unknown: Good evening Nzakhum!
How's your day going?
03/08/22, 21:44 - Unknown: I see you have typed 3, may I know what confusion are you facing?
03/08/22, 21:46 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
03/08/22, 21:55 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
03/08/22, 21:58 - Unknown: I am happy to see you following our daily ritual.
03/08/22, 22:52 - Nzakum EWYL20E0268: Thank you ?

10/08/22, 22:30 - Unknown: Nzankum you have been such a bright student of mine and I give your example to so many other kids that you are so consistent but today I observed that you have not followed the proud edoofian ritual. Is everything all right?
10/08/22, 22:31 - Unknown: Along with this, I am very excited to hear what have you learned from the weekend activity.
I would like to share what your fellow edoofians have shared, their response added so much knowledge to me.
10/08/22, 22:32 - Unknown: `SATURDAY TASK RESPONSE. ``
``
``Eugene Gilbert Peters became a successful Zimbabwean superstar through his efforts to work towards his passion. ``
``
``To start with, he is evidence in the way he speaks refusing to be a silent observer. This determined his present level of success. ``
``
``In addition, throughout his society, he is set apart by his genuine love for the next generation of interpreters. He hungers for every young person with a dream to get an opportunity to pursue it.``
His aspiration is to achieve beyond the borders of his country into the continent all over the world. I take away that throughout the journey of entrepreneurship, Gilbert Eugene Peter� had a long way to go so as to achieve. Others discouraged him to stop, pulling backward but he never gave up. He stifled his confidence and growth to proceed.``

``He also educates himself to become a recognized professional of the new generation doing Bachelor's degree of BCA at his tertiary level education and a post-graduate qualification.``

``Summing up, his way of success was focusing on the dream and ignoring destroyers. He looks for a good and genuine friend with a positive attitude toward life for instance her wife.
10/08/22, 22:33 - Unknown: I was so impressed by listening to his understanding and the way he expressed his opinions. 
You know Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi were also praising not just his response but the way he is so consistent and punctual with his sessions.
I want our sessions and interaction to be similar and want you to be outshining other students.

11/08/22, 22:06 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

How's your day going?
12/08/22, 19:38 - Unknown: So yes, did you do a quick research about Raksha Bandhan?
You know I had an amazing day yesterday. I am very excited to tell you how it all went.
First I put a red spot on my brother's forehead, it is called 'teeka'. Then we stick some rice to that spot and after that, I tied a beautiful decorative rakhi (a thread or ribbon) on this wrist.
Sisters do that for the long life of their brothers and to that, the brothers promise to protect their sisters.
Later we have delicious sweets and exchanged presents. ?
12/08/22, 19:38 - Unknown: Along with this, since our session was scheduled yesterday, and we had our festival, so we would have our session tomorrow in the missed session. Till that time,

I hope you are doing well.

So we know, a lot of you have been keeping busy these days with your exams and academic curriculum. And while we wish you all the luck for it, we don't want you to miss out on your learning and skill-building. In today's lesson, we will discuss how to build our capacity to multitask, manage our time and prioritize our daily tasks in order to have it all. 

Let's dig right in, and understand how if you follow these steps, you will be able to manage your exams, assignments, extracurriculars, and your EWYL projects all at one go. After going through this, you must discuss the plan of action to execute these steps with your mentors.

Happy Learning!

How are you doing?

As students, we constantly learn and expose ourselves to situations that help us learn anything and everything, but we must remember that each of us has the same number of hours in a day. Hence we must treat it important that we treat our Time as the currency of life. *Time Management* is essentially Priority Management.

In our session today on the *EWYL Line*, we will discuss:
1. How managing time is necessary
2. pending session on the weekend activity
