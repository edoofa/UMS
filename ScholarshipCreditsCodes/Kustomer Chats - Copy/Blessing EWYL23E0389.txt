17/09/23, 01:07 - Blessing EWYL23E0389: Afternoon to you Madam, I'm doing well here. I thank you for giving me this opportunity. Firstly on the techniques of studying, most people pressurize themselves studying when exams are around the corner to the extent of sleeping less than 4 hours per day however this is not healthy at all and it also disturb your understanding. People should sleep at least 8 and above hours per day .
Also others uses drugs or other substances to stimulate themselves to be able to read for a long time however this is not health again. 
For a study to be effective one should try to create his/ her time table to follow , this motivate him . 

Besides taking care of your study, there is what we call exam fever. This is a serious issue that makes more candidates to fail to express what they know in exam and sometimes ended up giving information which is not required. I think the best solution on that is to practice to write past exam papers on the exam conditions .
The another thing that  students must take not is to avoid malpractice. Malpractice can be referred to as any form of cheating on exam. This leads to disqualification if student caught cheating.
18/09/23, 00:08 - Blessing EWYL23E0389: Good afternoon
