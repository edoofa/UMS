19/12/23, 15:42 - Ananya: Good day, Tatenda! üéÑ‚òÄÔ∏è

Did you know that the tradition of hanging stockings by the fireplace comes from the legend of St. Nicholas? According to the story, St. Nicholas dropped gold coins down the chimney of a poor man's house, and they landed in the stockings that were hanging by the fire to dry. From then on, the tradition stuck, and now many of us hang stockings as part of our Christmas celebrations. üß¶‚ú®

Now that we've kicked off with a festive fun fact, how can I assist you in today's session? üòäüéÅ
19/12/23, 15:46 - Tatenda EWYL23E0627: Good day how are you

Here's to the memories etched in the canvas of 2023, a testament to resilience, growth, and the power of education.
02/01/24, 15:41 - Tatenda EWYL23E0627: Okay
02/01/24, 15:48 - Ananya: How are you Tatenda, how was your new year?
02/01/24, 15:48 - Tatenda EWYL23E0627: It was not that bad
02/01/24, 15:58 - Ananya: Well, I want to gently remind you about the importance of submitting your Saturday activity. It appears that you did not receive your Saturday activity as you did not follow your ritual that day!

I understand that life can get busy, and sometimes deadlines slip our minds. However, let's view this as a fresh start and an opportunity for growth. Instead of scolding, I encourage you to reflect on this as a chance to improve your time management and organizational skills.

Mistakes happen, and what's essential is how we learn and grow from them. If there are any challenges or concerns you're facing, please feel free to discuss them with me. Together, we can work towards a successful and productive year.
02/01/24, 15:59 - Tatenda EWYL23E0627: Sometimes I am facing network challenges
02/01/24, 16:11 - Ananya: I understand that; however, it has been more than a week now! Were you facing network challenges throughout the week?
02/01/24, 16:15 - Tatenda EWYL23E0627: Here and there
02/01/24, 16:20 - Ananya: Alright, Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
02/01/24, 16:20 - Tatenda EWYL23E0627: Okay go ahead
02/01/24, 16:22 - Ananya: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey‚Äîhow he initiated and scaled his business to such heights.
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
02/01/24, 16:24 - Tatenda EWYL23E0627: üòÇnot good at guessing
02/01/24, 16:32 - Ananya: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn‚Äîhe started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
02/01/24, 16:33 - Tatenda EWYL23E0627: Okay
02/01/24, 16:33 - Tatenda EWYL23E0627: So interesting
02/01/24, 16:36 - Ananya: You know, we are working on financing our education through the our projects and we will improve, but being your mentor I also want to ensure that you pass out not only with traditional peace of paper but with a lot of exposure and success.

So, for today, let's take a page from Raghav's book. Be proactive, build connections, explore opportunities, and turn LinkedIn into a tool that propels your dreams. If he can, why not you?
02/01/24, 16:37 - Tatenda EWYL23E0627: Yeah I can
02/01/24, 16:50 - Ananya: For Raghav, LinkedIn was about connections but you know you can do more with this tool, like :

*Career Exploration:*
Students can use LinkedIn to explore various career paths by following companies, organizations, and professionals in their chosen industries.
Access to diverse profiles and career journeys can help students make more informed decisions about their own career paths.
*Job and Internship Opportunities:*
Employers often use LinkedIn to post job and internship opportunities. Students can leverage the platform to find relevant openings and apply directly.
Building a strong LinkedIn profile increases the likelihood of recruiters discovering and reaching out to students for potential opportunities.
*Showcasing Skills and Accomplishments:*
LinkedIn allows students to showcase their academic achievements, skills, and extracurricular activities on a professional platform.
This can be an effective way to differentiate oneself from peers and demonstrate qualifications to potential employers.
02/01/24, 16:51 - Tatenda EWYL23E0627: Okay
02/01/24, 16:51 - Ananya: *Researching Companies and Industries:*
Students can use LinkedIn to research companies and industries they are interested in. Following companies provides updates on their activities, culture, and job openings.
Staying informed about industry trends and company developments is crucial for making informed career decisions.
*Learning from Professionals:*
Following industry leaders and professionals on LinkedIn allows students to stay updated on industry trends, insights, and thought leadership.
Engaging with relevant content can contribute to continuous learning and provide valuable perspectives.
*Building a Personal Brand:*
Crafting a professional LinkedIn profile helps students build a personal brand online.
A well-curated profile, including a professional photo, a compelling headline, and a well-written summary, can make a positive impression on recruiters and potential connections.
*Recommendations and Endorsements:*
LinkedIn allows users to receive recommendations and endorsements from professors, colleagues, or supervisors.
Positive recommendations and endorsements can add credibility to a student's profile and provide evidence of their skills and work ethic.
*Joining Professional Groups:*
LinkedIn offers various professional groups and communities where students can engage in discussions, ask questions, and stay updated on industry news.
Joining these groups can expand a student's network and provide valuable insights into their chosen field.
02/01/24, 16:59 - Tatenda EWYL23E0627: How can I have Linkedln
02/01/24, 18:44 - Ananya: Now that we are concluding today's session, I want you to create a LinkedIn profile before our next session so that we can discuss it further! Meanwhile, do not forget to follow your EWYL ritual tomorrow to receive your Wednesday lesson! üöÄ

16/01/24, 15:54 - Tatenda EWYL23E0627: Ok
16/01/24, 15:56 - Ananya: Good afternoon!
I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:
Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! üòÑ
16/01/24, 15:57 - Tatenda EWYL23E0627: üòÖ
16/01/24, 15:59 - Ananya: For today, I have planned something special! Do you know about a resume or a CV?
16/01/24, 16:00 - Tatenda EWYL23E0627: Yeah a CV is a form that is needed when applying for a job
16/01/24, 16:12 - Ananya: You know, a resume is like a super important paper for students. It shows all the cool things you've done in school and outside. When you want to get into a good school or get a job, you give them your resume so they can see how awesome you are. It's like your personal advertisement that says, 'Hey, I'm really good at these things, and I can do great stuff for you!' So, having a good resume helps you stand out and get cool opportunities.
16/01/24, 16:14 - Tatenda EWYL23E0627: Okay
16/01/24, 16:19 - Ananya: Well, yesterday I was updating my little brother's resume and took help from this video. I thought to share this with you as well, as he is suggesting some really good things!

https://youtu.be/QnUI3sLZ4hc?si=HTbUElM6TNHZaPlN
16/01/24, 16:21 - Tatenda EWYL23E0627: I will watch the video
16/01/24, 16:28 - Ananya: Alright! Well, I know we still have 30 minutes left for the session, however, due to bad health, I am unable to move forward. So, let us wrap our session early today. However, remember, every effort you put in is a step closer to success. Keep participating, stay motivated, and earn those credits! You're all doing great, and I look forward to our continued journey together. See you next time!
