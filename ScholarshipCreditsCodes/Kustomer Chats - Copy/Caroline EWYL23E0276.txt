11/08/23, 13:35 - Caroline EWYL23E0276: 
11/08/23, 13:35 - Caroline EWYL23E0276: 
11/08/23, 13:35 - Caroline EWYL23E0276: 
11/08/23, 13:35 - Caroline EWYL23E0276:

11/08/23, 13:36 - Aditi Kapoor: I would also like to inform you Caroline that the form you sent for Mr. Mandebvu Takesure who wanted to pursue PhD in India has been reached out by our Senior Career Counselor.
11/08/23, 13:37 - Caroline EWYL23E0276: Well l have been interacting with students mam and l sent some of the students offline applications in the group yesterday. From what the students told me it seems like the biggest challenge is to convince their parents only but they seem to want this opportunity.
11/08/23, 13:37 - Caroline EWYL23E0276: That Is wonderful mam
11/08/23, 13:41 - Aditi Kapoor: So Caroline, may I know if you have shared the video where the First Lady of Zimbabwe has acknowledged Edoofa's work for African students affordable quality education and also she personally requested us to reserve a few seats for some students of her NGO.
11/08/23, 13:46 - Caroline EWYL23E0276: Yes mam i did because that video also proves the legitimacy of the program and how it also interacted with the first Lady of Zimbabwe
11/08/23, 13:49 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, that is great.
So may i know why is it difficult to convince their parents, is there any other confusion or issue that they are facing?
11/08/23, 13:50 - Caroline EWYL23E0276: Well some of them question the the legitimacy of the program and some do not understand the payments mam
11/08/23, 13:50 - Caroline EWYL23E0276: And others are also worrieed about their children moving into a new continent
11/08/23, 13:51 - Aditi Kapoor: So here are a few means by which bloggers earn money:

Ad Revenue: Vloggers can monetize their videos through platforms like YouTube by allowing ads to be displayed before or during their videos. They receive a share of the ad revenue generated based on factors like views, engagement, and ad type.
Sponsorships and Brand Deals: Vloggers can collaborate with brands to create sponsored content. They promote products or services in their videos in exchange for payment or free products. These deals are often tailored to the vlogger's niche and audience.
Affiliate Marketing: Vloggers can include affiliate links in their video descriptions or use referral codes to promote products. When viewers make purchases through these links, the vlogger earns a commission.
Merchandise Sales: Some vloggers create and sell their own merchandise, such as clothing, accessories, or digital products, related to their brand and content.
11/08/23, 13:52 - Aditi Kapoor: Caroline, please excuse me I sent this message in the wrong window, as I was explaining this to my other student about ways to earn money from vlogging.
11/08/23, 13:53 - Caroline EWYL23E0276: It's okay mam I understand
11/08/23, 13:54 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, I get the issues of the parents.
In this case there is a way I can help you out.
11/08/23, 13:55 - Caroline EWYL23E0276: Oky mam how so
11/08/23, 13:56 - Aditi Kapoor: But first I need you Caroline to change the Community Building group name as you need to update the mentor's name there, alright?
11/08/23, 13:58 - Caroline EWYL23E0276: Oky mam so i shoud write tou name right
11/08/23, 13:59 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes.
11/08/23, 13:59 - Caroline EWYL23E0276: Oky mam let me do so right away
11/08/23, 14:01 - Caroline EWYL23E0276: I have changed the name mam
11/08/23, 14:03 - Aditi Kapoor: Great, so to help you out I would ask our senior career counselor Mr. Piyush to take up a counseling session in the group so that parents' and students doubts can be resolved and they could look up to Mr. Piyush for any issue.
11/08/23, 14:04 - Aditi Kapoor: So for that, I would like you to make me the group admin so that I can add Mr. Piyush.
11/08/23, 14:04 - Caroline EWYL23E0276: Oky mam let me do so
11/08/23, 14:05 - Caroline EWYL23E0276: I have done so mam
11/08/23, 14:06 - Aditi Kapoor: Also, for any additional forms that you get after this, you would have to follow the same procedure and send those to me in the EWYL Group so that Ms. Deepali can also evaluate your performance and see your progress.
11/08/23, 14:06 - Aditi Kapoor: Great!
11/08/23, 14:07 - Caroline EWYL23E0276: Oky mam l Understand
11/08/23, 14:11 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, great!
So may I know if you have any doubts or you are facing any issues regarding any project?
11/08/23, 14:15 - Caroline EWYL23E0276: For now im not Mam
11/08/23, 14:16 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay that is great!
