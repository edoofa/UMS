03/11/23, 14:37 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0795: Thank you
04/11/23, 11:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Tadiwanashe!
I hope this message finds you well. I would like to extend my sincere apologies for the inconvenience I may have caused over the past two days.

On Thursday, I experienced an unexpected deterioration in my health, which required me to be urgently taken to my home. Unfortunately, this left me in a situation where I was unable to inform you about my absence from our session.

Then, on Friday, I had the obligation to attend a grand orientation event at one of our partner universities. Given the importance of this event, I found it necessary to be present.

Once again, I deeply apologize for any disruption my absence may have caused, and I assure you that I value our commitments and responsibilities. I am committed to making up for any missed work or obligations in the coming days.
04/11/23, 11:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Thank you for your understanding and patience during this time. Please let me know if there is anything specific I need to address or catch up on.

Hope you are doing well.

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼

15/11/23, 15:08 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0795: Apologies, my network tripped
15/11/23, 15:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy Wednesday! 🌟
Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

18/11/23, 13:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Mr Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one – it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!

23/11/23, 15:33 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0795: Good afternoon
23/11/23, 15:37 - Saloni Rastogi: Good afternoon,
I hope this message finds you well. 

Today, let's delve into our exciting and innovative Wednesday lesson, exploring new perspectives and discussing our progress on various projects. I'm eager to hear your insights and contributions during our session.
23/11/23, 15:38 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0795: I am well thank you.
23/11/23, 15:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share Tadiwanashe what you learned from the Wednesday lesson?
23/11/23, 15:49 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0795: Well it is true that a competitive spirit brings about excellence. It becomes the drive and source of motivation for a student to bring out the best of their effort. It helps the student to surpass their limits; however to some limited extent it may promote selfishness in a student.
23/11/23, 15:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Your acknowledgment of the positive impact of a competitive spirit on fostering excellence in students is insightful. Indeed, competition serves as a powerful driving force and motivation for students to push their boundaries and unleash their full potential. Your astute observation about the potential downside, acknowledging that excessive competition may, to a limited extent, promote selfishness, demonstrates a balanced perspective.
23/11/23, 15:51 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0795: 😊😊😊But since the positivity outweighs the negativity by far, the notion stands.
23/11/23, 15:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, that will always stay true!
23/11/23, 15:53 - Saloni Rastogi: So can you share what we last discussed about the projects?
23/11/23, 15:57 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0795: Uhm I believe we talked about how the projects are going to help others other than myself.
23/11/23, 16:01 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0795: I believe that's the summary of it all.
23/11/23, 16:10 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0795: May we continue please
23/11/23, 16:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for the delay Tadiwanashe.
23/11/23, 16:16 - Saloni Rastogi: So you talked about community building project, may I know how have you planned to work on it?
23/11/23, 16:17 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0795: I had intended to do the second project where I join groups of some scholars then I tell them about Edoofa and finally giving them the forms to fill in.
23/11/23, 16:21 - Saloni Rastogi: That is great, can you share how will you try to do that?

After you share your ideas, I will also share how my bright students have done it.
23/11/23, 16:24 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0795: I simply make a follow up in groups that are school related especially study groups on WhatsApp for a particular subject. Most of the participants in those groups are going to wrote their A levels next year so it will be easy. I then try to teach them about the Edoofa program, I would then send the forms to those that will b interested.
23/11/23, 16:34 - Saloni Rastogi: That is great Tadiwanashe, so before moving ahead, may I know if you have formed a WhatsApp group amongst students?
23/11/23, 16:34 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0795: No, not yet.
23/11/23, 16:37 - Saloni Rastogi: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
23/11/23, 16:37 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0795: Yes please.
23/11/23, 16:37 - Saloni Rastogi: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*

For eg: In your case, it will be-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*
23/11/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi: *Tadiwanashe/Saloni/23NOV2023*

You will name the group this
23/11/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
23/11/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
23/11/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
23/11/23, 16:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
23/11/23, 16:43 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0795: I understand, I will try that
23/11/23, 16:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Today I want you to form the group and add as many students as possible.
23/11/23, 16:58 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0795: I will try my best. If I receive a filled form where do I send it?
23/11/23, 16:59 - Saloni Rastogi: Send it in the EWYL Group.
23/11/23, 17:00 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0795: Okay thank you
23/11/23, 17:17 - Saloni Rastogi: We will conclude the session for today but for you to be a proud edoofian, you need to be in touch with your mentor and share the updates daily.
Please take care and make the most of today!
23/11/23, 17:18 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0795: Noted thank you.
