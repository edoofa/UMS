25/04/23, 09:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, ready for a motivational monday?

In a remote village, there lives a hardworking farmer who owns a farm. Over the years his grapery yields rich crops, and the farmer is very successful. He has three sons, who are young and energetic but never worry about working. As the farmer grows older, he begins to worry about his sons‚Äô future.

Then he becomes very ill and feels that his death is coming soon. He calls his sons and says,

‚ÄúDear sons, I see my death approaching, but I want to share a secret before you all leave. These areas have treasure hidden inside. Dig the whole area after my death, to find it. ‚Äù

The old farmer died. The sons start digging for money without leaving any part of the field but nothing is found. In any case, digging their fields leads to healthier crops and results in higher incomes. These earnings make the sons realize what their father means.

What according to you is the moral of the story?

a. Hard work always pays off. The fruits of hard work are always sweet.
b. Be Selflessly kind
c. both a & b

Last week we learnt about first 6 principles from the book- Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. Today‚Äôs Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the remaining principles. Ready to learn in detail?

The book outlines specific principles and strategies that successful people have used to achieve their goals. By following these principles, readers can create a roadmap for their own success. I believe, reading "Think and Grow Rich" can provide readers with the mindset, motivation, and strategies needed to achieve success in any area of life. Let us discuss in detail about your learnings in our upcoming scheduled session.


Happy Learning

We organized an outing to Cyber Hub in Gurgaon, where they were able to experience various popular establishments such as McDonald's, Domino's, Decathlon, Marc and Spencer's, and Archies. They also had a chance to see the offices of some of the big companies like Toshiba, Kia etc.

It was a pleasure getting to know them outside of the sessions and having the opportunity to connect with them on a more personal level.

Furthermore, the students had the opportunity to spend time with our team at our office, participating in enjoyable activities.

Given the excitement of the experience, I feel compelled to share a glimpse of the event with you.

I am excited to announce that today‚Äôs Wednesday Wisdom will be talking about the spirit of belonging and the feeling of being part of the Edoofa student community. As a member of the Edoofa family, it is important to understand the significance of being part of a community that fosters personal and academic growth. We will explore the benefits of being part of the Edoofa student community, including the sense of belonging and unity that it creates, the opportunities for networking and mentorship, and the development of essential skills such as leadership, teamwork, and communication.
The Lesson also delve into the idea of belonging as an ability, and how we can develop this ability to connect with others, build relationships, and establish a sense of belonging that allows us to feel valued, appreciated, and accepted.

Let's come together to learn, grow, and build a stronger sense of community.
Best regards,
Team EWYL
