From the Wednesday Wisdom l learnt that curiosity, perseverance and the urge to exploit great opportunities as they come can determine how successful l can become. So in everything perseverance and determination will enable any individual in becoming successful.

Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time.

We must know why is a Personal Brand Statement Important.
- For networking, job searches, and overall career development, having a personal brand statement provides a lot of benefits. People will search for you online and check out your reputation when they are evaluating whether to hire you or partner with you.

- Your brand statement is the first thing that people will associate with you so you want to start on the right foot.

- A strong personal brand can open up doors to speaking engagements, job interviews, promotions, client relationships, and overall business success.
