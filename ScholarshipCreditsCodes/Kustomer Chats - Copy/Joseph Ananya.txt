17/06/23, 11:53 - Joseph Ananya: So what time will be starting today's session
17/06/23, 11:55 - Aditi Kapoor: Let's begin now. It has been quite a while since we last connected. May I ask how you and your family are doing?
17/06/23, 11:57 - Joseph Ananya: I'm doing great. I'm so hopeful of studying in India soon.
My family is in good health and sound. Always there to support me

17/06/23, 12:01 - Joseph Ananya: I'm currently processing my Visa
17/06/23, 12:02 - Aditi Kapoor: And what about your packing?
17/06/23, 12:03 - Joseph Ananya: Pardon, What do you mean by packing
17/06/23, 12:04 - Aditi Kapoor: Have you started shopping and keeping your clothes and other stuff?
17/06/23, 12:05 - Joseph Ananya: Ooh i get it. I'm doing some extra jobs here and saving towards that and other necessities
17/06/23, 12:08 - Aditi Kapoor: That is very responsible of you! May I know what kind of job are you doing?
17/06/23, 12:09 - Joseph Ananya: General shop keeping.  I will be organizing stocks on shelves and reStocking.
At times cleaning.
17/06/23, 12:14 - Aditi Kapoor: That's really hardworking! Now, may I ask if would you like to share which project is your favorite?
17/06/23, 12:16 - Joseph Ananya: Project 2 which is about Community building
17/06/23, 12:18 - Aditi Kapoor: Wonderful, so may I know about your progress in this project?
17/06/23, 12:19 - Joseph Ananya: I'm still working on that. Right now i have been reaching out to students from my former school creating connections. But I'm making progress
17/06/23, 12:22 - Aditi Kapoor: That's great! I've got an amazing idea that I think will help you get the most out of your efforts and earn even more credits! Trust me, you won't want to miss this one.
17/06/23, 12:23 - Joseph Ananya: Really.  I would love to hear more about that
17/06/23, 12:25 - Aditi Kapoor: I assume you already know that every school class has an informal WhatsApp group.

You can request to be added to the group and share information. Additionally, you can share the group's WhatsApp link and invite others who might be interested in joining. You can also add me to the group, and I can assist you in engaging the students.
17/06/23, 12:26 - Joseph Ananya: Yeah that's a wonderful plan. I will make use of this to engage the students
17/06/23, 12:29 - Aditi Kapoor: Now, to create a group you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
17/06/23, 12:30 - Aditi Kapoor: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
17/06/23, 12:30 - Aditi Kapoor: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
17/06/23, 12:30 - Aditi Kapoor: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
17/06/23, 12:30 - Aditi Kapoor: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
17/06/23, 12:32 - Joseph Ananya: That's wonderful and workable. I understand the steps
17/06/23, 12:33 - Aditi Kapoor: Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
17/06/23, 12:33 - Joseph Ananya: Definitely i will add you.

17/06/23, 12:34 - Aditi Kapoor: .
17/06/23, 12:36 - Joseph Ananya: Noted with thanks. Will relay the information to them
17/06/23, 12:37 - Aditi Kapoor: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,

1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
17/06/23, 12:37 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe.
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5‚ÄôS which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5‚ÄôS of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
17/06/23, 12:37 - Aditi Kapoor: .
17/06/23, 12:40 - Joseph Ananya: I understand
17/06/23, 12:44 - Aditi Kapoor: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
17/06/23, 12:44 - Aditi Kapoor: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!üéâ
17/06/23, 12:44 - Aditi Kapoor: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countriesüìç
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
17/06/23, 12:45 - Joseph Ananya: Well Noted
17/06/23, 12:46 - Aditi Kapoor: Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above. After you are satisfied with the student‚Äôs response, you will share about Edoofa‚Äôs Meet and Greet Session that happened in Harare. I am sharing the messages regarding that below:
17/06/23, 12:46 - Aditi Kapoor: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa‚Äôs Meet and Greet session where Edoofa‚Äôs founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.
