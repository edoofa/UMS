19/09/23, 13:37 - Mercy EWYL23E0136: To effectively plan for an examination l have these tips and strategies that l think would help someone preparing for an examination. To effectively plan for an exam, l would advise someone to map out a study plan which can be 2 or three weeks before an examination. This will allow someone to avoid cramming and also help in alleviating stress. One has to make a revision schedule that is realistic and that suits him or her. The person has to personalize his or her notes in a way that is understandable. one of the best way to do so is to look at the past exam papers so that you familialize yourself with exam questions. After reading one also need to sit down and relax so as to freshen up the mind. Lastly, reward yourself to keep going.
19/09/23, 13:37 - Jasmine Kaur: Till the time, I read your activity I would like to tell you that this week we will be focusing on Project 2 i.e. Community Building. So, first of all, I would want you to update me on your performance so far in this project.

22/09/23, 12:52 - Mercy EWYL23E0136: The Wednesday wisdom was all about freelancing. Freelancing refers to a work arrangement in which individuals, often called freelancers or independent contractors offer their services to clients or other companies on a project by project basis without being fully employed. The freelancers are self employed and work independently, providing services in various fields for example writing, design, programming, marketing and consulting. The freelancers are of benefits to us students who are looking forward to earn while persuing our studies. The characteristics of a freelancer include being independent, remote working, self employed, variable income , networking and freedom. It is a reward to the people who value flexibility, indep3ndence and the opportunity to work on diverse projects however it comes with its own challenges including need for self discipline, responsibility of managing all aspects of one's business and potential for income fluctuations. Successful freelancers often develop a strong online presence, market their services effectively and continuously upgrade their skills to stay competitive in their chosen field.

22/09/23, 14:14 - Jasmine Kaur: Why Mercy?
22/09/23, 14:15 - Mercy EWYL23E0136: Because students get advise from their parents so since they are at school they may not be able to communicate with their parents
22/09/23, 14:24 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, So don't you think it would be better if you talk to the parents directly?
22/09/23, 14:26 - Mercy EWYL23E0136: Not really but somehow it is important but the students have to influence their parents so we should also discuss the matters with both the student and parents
22/09/23, 14:28 - Jasmine Kaur: That is true but if you talk directly to the parents and share the benefits with them. Don't you think this will be better?
22/09/23, 14:28 - Mercy EWYL23E0136: Yes it will be better
22/09/23, 14:29 - Jasmine Kaur: That is great. It was lovely talking to you Mercy. All the Best!
