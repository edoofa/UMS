11/01/23, 22:20 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello My proud Edoofian, 

Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals towards achieving this goal. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

I would appreciate you sharing your learnings from today’s lesson. 

Happy learning!
11/01/23, 22:48 - Michael EWYL22E0926: Ok so i understood that the first thing to do is to simplify your situation  and attend to the biggest hurdles first 
Secondly math is also an important notion as it adds to your numerical fluency. Thirdly invert problems to make them less challenging and also think in reverse like Pythagoras and Carl Jacobi.
The fourth notion is to study the basics as they aid you in understanding your biggest flaws and you also need to rely more on yourself than others
The last factor was the Lollapalooza effect which combines big things for bigger effects
