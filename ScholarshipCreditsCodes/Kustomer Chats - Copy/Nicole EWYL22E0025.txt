Rituals¬†motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending ‚Äú I am a proud Edoofian‚Äù even on Sundays!

Best wishes for the new day!
Team edoofa has arranged a *webinar*  for you all, 
The webinar would be taken by *Ronard Kachage.*
Designation  at Success Magazine.

*Date  August*

*Takeaways from the webinar.*
The topic will be along the lines of how Mr. Kachaje went on to pursue a career in real estate by having a degree in the same field and eventually figured out his calling which was building the media brand  Magazine. One of the many benefits of starting a business or pursuing your passions when one is a bit older is that they bring all of the experience and wisdom to the table. 
The journey of Mr. Kachaje is certainly inspiring, growth-oriented, and a wonderful example for the youth of today, not only in terms of being passionate about what you believe in but also having a consistent outlook towards learning on the way and figuring things out at the same time.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off

14/07/23, 14:33 - Nicole EWYL22E0025: Here what exactly do l need to comment on
14/07/23, 17:35 - Tenzin: You need to read and share your thoughts and understanding and any research you did.
14/07/23, 17:36 - Nicole EWYL22E0025: Okay
14/07/23, 18:41 - Nicole EWYL22E0025: *A person who is happy is not happy because everything is right in his life, he is happy because his attitude towards everything in his life is right.* this is one of the most famous inspirational quotes of Sundar Pichai that l discovered.

In addition to his focus on collaboration, innovation, and transparency, Pichai is also known for his commitment to diversity and inclusion.He has worked to create a workplace at Google that is inclusive and welcoming to people of all backgrounds and experiences.  Bill Gates had said - If you are born poor, it's not your mistake but if you die poor, it is your mistake. Pichai's journey is proof of this - he did not let his background determine his future. He constantly encourages people to dream big, break boundaries and follow their passion. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai is too soft when it comes to leadership and handling people at all levels. He doesn't reportedly have a good hold on top-level people across company. A living legend that Puchai is,humility is one characteristic that never left his side.Easily approachable and soft spoken,he let's his work speak for himself,maintains a calm demeanor and strives to stay patient and live a drama free life.Despite his growing popularity,he believes in keeping a low profile.
14/07/23, 18:47 - Tenzin: I completely agree with you. Sundar Pichai's famous quote about happiness reflects his understanding of the importance of attitude in one's life. It emphasizes the power of having a positive mindset and approaching challenges with the right attitude.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend.
17/07/23, 15:36 - Nicole EWYL22E0025: I am fine,thanks and how are you
17/07/23, 15:43 - Tenzin: I am good, Thank you.
17/07/23, 15:48 - Tenzin: Please submit you activity.
17/07/23, 15:51 - Nicole EWYL22E0025: Okay
17/07/23, 16:07 - Tenzin: Nicole, I am waiting for the submission.
17/07/23, 16:18 - Nicole EWYL22E0025: Yes I'm still typing my research
17/07/23, 16:19 - Tenzin: Okay, Nicole.
17/07/23, 16:23 - Nicole EWYL22E0025: The most influential businessman of my country is Strive Masiyiwa. He grew up in a poor family in what was then Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and he faced a lot of discrimination and hardship in his life. He got his start in business by selling chickens and vegetables, and he used the profits to start other businesses. Eventually, he started Econet Wireless, which became a huge success. Masiyiwa has also been very generous with his wealth, and he's used it to support education, healthcare, and other causes.Strive Masiyiwa has had a huge impact on Zimbabwean society. Through his businesses and philanthropy, he's helped create jobs and opportunities for people. He's also been a champion of education, providing scholarships and building schools. He's helped improve healthcare by building clinics and supporting programs that train healthcare workers. And he's been an advocate for social justice, speaking out against corruption and working to improve human rights. He's also been a role model for many young people, showing them that they can achieve their dreams through hard work and perseverance.I think Strive Masiyiwa is inspiring for many reasons. First, his story of overcoming adversity and succeeding against the odds is very inspiring. He didn't have an easy start in life, and he's faced many challenges, but he never gave up and he always found a way to succeed. Second, his focus on giving back and helping others is inspiring. He's used his wealth and influence to make a difference in the world, and he's shown that it's possible to use business as a force for good. Third, he's a very humble and down-to-earth person, despite his wealth and success.
17/07/23, 16:25 - Tenzin: Nicole, Give me a few minutes to go through your essay.
Please give me your progress on the project in the meantime.
17/07/23, 16:31 - Tenzin: I completely agree with you on the tremendous impact and inspiration that Strive Masiyiwa, the influential businessman from Zimbabwe, has had on society. His journey from humble beginnings to achieving remarkable success is truly inspiring.
 His journey of triumph over adversity, his dedication to philanthropy, and his commitment to social justice make him an inspiration to many. May his continued endeavors inspire more individuals to follow in his footsteps and make a positive difference in their communities and beyond.
17/07/23, 16:38 - Nicole EWYL22E0025: Which project ma'am

20/07/23, 16:11 - Nicole EWYL22E0025: *Wednesday wisdom*
An influential student leader is someone who has the ability to motivate and inspire other students. They're often passionate about making a difference and fighting for change.There are many qualities that make a student leader influential. First, they should be passionate about their cause and have a clear vision for what they want to achieve. They should also be able to communicate their ideas clearly and effectively. They should be able to build relationships and work with others to achieve their goals. They should be willing to take risks and stand up for what they believe in, even if it's unpopular. They should be willing to learn and grow, and they should be humble and open to feedback. Finally, they should be resilient and determined, even in the face of challenges and setbacks.
20/07/23, 16:17 - Tenzin: agree wholeheartedly with the Wednesday wisdom on influential student leaders. Your description of such leaders highlights the essential qualities that set them apart and enable them to make a significant impact on their community.
The passion and dedication of influential student leaders in making a difference and driving positive change are truly admirable. Their clear vision and ability to communicate effectively allow them to inspire and motivate their peers effectively.

Embrace learning like Samuel, a poor but determined boy. Passing a library every day, he couldn't resist its allure. With borrowed books, he studied relentlessly, earning a scholarship to a prestigious school. Hard work won him a scholarship to a renowned university. But Rahul's journey didn't end there. He built libraries in his village, offering free education to underprivileged children. Let his story inspire you to never stop pursuing knowledge. Education is a powerful tool to transform your life and help others. Believe in yourself, embrace every opportunity to learn, and make today a day of growth.
