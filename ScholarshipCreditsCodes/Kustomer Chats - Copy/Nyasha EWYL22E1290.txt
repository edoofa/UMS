4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate\/Construction

04/03/23, 22:01 - Nyasha EWYL22E1290: Thank you ma'am
04/03/23, 22:15 - Saloni Rastogi: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
04/03/23, 22:15 - Nyasha EWYL22E1290: Following ma'am
04/03/23, 22:15 - Saloni Rastogi: A] Through WhatsApp community groups:


STEP 1: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME\/(slash)MENTOR NAME\/(SLASH)DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED
For eg: a student named Tendai who formed the group on 1st February will name it-
Tendai\/Saloni\/1FEB2023
04/03/23, 22:16 - Saloni Rastogi: STEP 2: We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

As for attracting the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 5, and Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
04/03/23, 22:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
04/03/23, 22:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to STUDY IN INDIA with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

And in a very similar manner, you can repeat the same process with the Form 5 students as well.
04/03/23, 22:17 - Nyasha EWYL22E1290: Following.thank you ma'am
04/03/23, 22:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Today, I would want that you work on this plan, rest we will discuss on Monday from 11:30-02:30 PM.
04/03/23, 22:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Add me also so that I see your progress.
04/03/23, 22:59 - Nyasha EWYL22E1290: Oky.thank you ma'am

06/03/23, 20:32 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”
