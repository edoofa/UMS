Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

12/11/22, 18:05 - Saloni Rastogi: Well, on Wednesday Wisdom, I got reminded of one quote:

“There comes a time when you look into the mirror and realize that what you see is all you will ever be. And then you accept it. Or you kill yourself. Or you stop looking in mirrors.”
― J. Michael Straczynski

It touched me completely.
It means we should not think of ourselves as anything when we look in the mirror. And if we are thinking of ourselves as something, then it should be worthy and competent enough.
12/11/22, 18:28 - Tatenda EWYL22E0576: Yes that's true indeed
12/11/22, 18:28 - Tatenda EWYL22E0576: I'm good Ms Saloni

16/11/22, 21:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, my dear proud Edoofian. I hope all is well with you.

Another insightful Wednesday Wisdom is presented here. The lesson today teaches us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, disability. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition. A few questions near the end of the session will ask you to reflect and have an open dialogue with yourself. After you finish your lesson, as your mentor, I'd like to have a thorough conversation about your key take aways, in our upcoming sessions.

Enjoy the article and keep in mind that success does not come to you suddenly; rather, it can be attained over time by making modest, daily improvements.

Happy learning!
