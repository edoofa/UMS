04/10/23, 13:35 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofians,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning

10/10/23, 15:43 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Afternoon,
How are you doing? IT'S TIME FOR THE SESSION
10/10/23, 16:17 - Cleopatra EWYL22E1223: Am online how are you
10/10/23, 16:19 - Jasmine Kaur: I am very well Cleopatra, How are you?
10/10/23, 16:21 - Cleopatra EWYL22E1223: Am gud and you. It's very hot today
10/10/23, 16:34 - Jasmine Kaur: I am very well dear. Summer can be quite the sizzler. Just remember to stay hydrated and find some shade. The heat won't last forever! 🌴
10/10/23, 16:37 - Cleopatra EWYL22E1223: Thank you so much for the advice
10/10/23, 16:37 - Jasmine Kaur: Before we dive into our session today, could you kindly confirm whether you were able to complete your Saturday activity?
10/10/23, 16:43 - Cleopatra EWYL22E1223: I have shared the activity with Cleopatra and she seems to be busy with her preparations for the exams
10/10/23, 16:44 - Jasmine Kaur: Could you please clarify who I am currently conversing with?
10/10/23, 16:44 - Cleopatra EWYL22E1223: Cleopatra's father
10/10/23, 16:46 - Jasmine Kaur: I apologize for any confusion. Can you please confirm if Cleopatra is currently enrolled in the boarding school?
10/10/23, 16:47 - Cleopatra EWYL22E1223: Yes she's
10/10/23, 16:51 - Jasmine Kaur: I'd like to propose a temporary pause in our sessions, as I believe they are most effective when I am directly communicating with Cleopatra. The goal is to ensure that Cleopatra is benefitting from our sessions, and if I delegate tasks to you but Cleopatra isn't actively engaged, it might not serve the intended purpose. Do you agree with this approach, and do you have any thoughts or suggestions regarding this matter?
10/10/23, 16:58 - Cleopatra EWYL22E1223: I think that's a great idea
