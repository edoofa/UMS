22/07/22, 18:37 - Tinotenda EWYL21E0867: My takeaways from the lesson is that we don't have to blame anyone for our failure because sometimes our failure is self inflicted.I also learned that it easy to put a blame on someone that he\/she is behind our failure.  I also learned that people who put blames on others I those who argue that failure is unavoidable. Moreover the most crucial point that inspires me is that if you want something to happen that Is if you Want to succeed get to work, put effort in everything.

The matrix seems to be crucial as it allows us to use our time wisely.  It also helps us to do the specific task at its good time.  It also helps us to plan on our projects.  Like which project am our going to do in the coming hours and also when will I move to other project.

From Peter's my takeaways are 
Firstly the way he managed his business seemed to be very inspirational to me because if you take a very close look at his business you will note that there is coherence in his business.  That is I noted that the segments in his business are not separate from each other eg copyright and design. Secondly I also noted that he starts his business at early age.  This is inspirational as it inspires us that is putting a spirit of commencing our own business at early ages. Furthermore ,  I also noted that there is need to hell each other in business as evidenced by how peter and his wife supported each other despite the plights they face in their business. Moreover I also noted that Peter encouraged us to believe in ourselves.

My takeaways from the Wednesday wisdom are we have to live by intent not by luck because if we live by intent we will have  the ability to control each and every aspect in life.  Secondly  we are also supposed to  stop fixating on failure. In.life we don't have to accept failure.  If we fall 100 times on the hand we will have 100 lessons learnt.  Lastly we have to find our  your inspiration because being  conscious of your contribution  will keep you inspired.

11/08/22, 22:06 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off

Let me share about myself…
24/08/22, 22:01 - Tinotenda EWYL21E0867: You are welcome
24/08/22, 22:02 - Tinotenda EWYL21E0867: Noted.
24/08/22, 22:03 - Aditi Kapoor: I have shared something on the EWYL group, once you have a look at it and let me know here once you see it.
24/08/22, 22:05 - Tinotenda EWYL21E0867: Ok
25/08/22, 17:45 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Tinotenda!
How are you doing today?
The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of those depths.
The three said sharing their stories should inspire youths to work hard toward achieving their goals and shun a life of drugs.
This lesson was something that added so much to my knowledge and yes, took me one step ahead in this stage of learning:
So in our session today, we will:
1. discuss how these three brains inspired you
2. discussion on the community building project (I am sharing audio and revised form with you, have a look at it and then we will discuss it along with our lesson discussion)
25/08/22, 17:46 - Aditi Kapoor: Also, I see you have not followed the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', please do that Tinotenda.
25/08/22, 17:47 - Aditi Kapoor: Let me define an Edoofian for you Tinotenda: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
25/08/22, 17:47 - Aditi Kapoor: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
26/08/22, 16:39 - Tinotenda EWYL21E0867: I'm proud edoofian.

Along with this, what I am concerned more about is our scholarship target for this month that you have set, how are we going to achieve that?
We need to plan that and work on it from today onwards.
I don't expect any late back attitude from you, I want to work very hard for you but it will only fructify when you will put equivalent and solid efforts into that.

- how are you working on it

In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. Those unfamiliar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.
Responses will be accepted on the *EWYL Line* only.
_Till then keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'_.

Happy learning and enjoy your weekend!
