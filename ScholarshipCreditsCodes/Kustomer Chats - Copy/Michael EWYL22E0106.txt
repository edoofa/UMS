12/07/22, 18:55 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

On Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
Sounds interesting, right?

I am sure you will agree to the fact that Attitude plays a major role in our day-to-day life. It is also a waste of time if the proper attitude and effective abilities are not developed. In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we discuss a crucial character quality that everyone should work on and make sure they have mastered the right attitude. Once you have read the full lesson, We will be having the discussion concerning the same in our next session. Write down if you have any questions or key observations from the lesson. 

Happy learning!

25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
