01/02/23, 00:32 - Aditi Kapoor: Awesome!
01/02/23, 00:33 - Aditi Kapoor: Proud Edoofian, This week, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
01/02/23, 00:33 - Aditi Kapoor: May I know if you have Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead tomorrow.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him\/her for your School Head’s Contact.
01/02/23, 19:41 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

Happy Learning!

03/02/23, 22:41 - Aditi Kapoor: So the best time to create a Linkedin account is during your final years of school and build a strong profile on your college days.
03/02/23, 22:42 - Genius EWYL22E0649: Well understood my mentor
03/02/23, 22:45 - Aditi Kapoor: So can you recover your account or is it better making a new one?
