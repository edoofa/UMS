28/12/23, 15:46 - Unknown: Good afternoon Magreth

üåå "Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning." - Albert Einstein üåü

As we delve into Einstein's insightful words, we're reminded of the dynamic journey of learning and growth. "Learn from yesterday" encourages reflection on past experiences, "live for today" emphasizes the present moment, and "hope for tomorrow" instills a forward-looking mindset.

In the context of your academic pursuit, this quote beckons you to embrace the continuous cycle of learning, applying knowledge in the present, and fostering hope for the future. Each question you pose becomes a stepping stone to new discoveries and personal development.

So, how are you doing today? üåà I'm buzzing with excitement to explore, learn, and grow together in our session.
28/12/23, 15:46 - Magreth EWYL22E0838: thank you
28/12/23, 15:51 - Magreth EWYL22E0838: I'm doing good and you
28/12/23, 15:57 - Unknown: I am glad to know that, you are very welcome please.
28/12/23, 15:57 - Unknown: *I am now looking forward to reading your understanding of the Wednesday Lesson.* The lesson was shared with you yesterday.
28/12/23, 15:58 - Magreth EWYL22E0838: ‚òùüèª
28/12/23, 16:21 - Unknown: Okay Magreth. 
Your understanding of the relationship between a growth mindset and goal  setting is insightful. A growth mindset indeed empowers individuals to  embrace challenges, view problems as opportunities for learning, and  handle difficulties effectively. Combining this mindset with goal  setting provides focus and direction, guiding individuals toward  specific achievements in life.
28/12/23, 16:36 - Unknown: Are you there in the session ? Kindly respond.
28/12/23, 16:47 - Magreth EWYL22E0838: Okey
28/12/23, 16:47 - Magreth EWYL22E0838: Yed
28/12/23, 16:48 - Magreth EWYL22E0838: Yes
28/12/23, 17:30 - Unknown: So, you've filled out those student application forms for the Community Building Project or you plan to fill and submit the application forms.


Now, it is your responsibility to explain to these interested students about what Edoofa is and how it can benefit you.
28/12/23, 17:33 - Magreth EWYL22E0838: I pla to fill and submit
28/12/23, 18:05 - Unknown: Authentic and real exchange of information will ensure you are not connecting these students to Edoofa but also connecting with them on a humane and personal level. It will speak volume about your integrity.

Imagine this: If any of this interested student answers the career counselor, "*Nope, my friend (you)  never told me about Edoofa*."

In such a scenario - you won't get any scholarship credits.


Hence, in order to avoid such a mishap, let's be smart.
28/12/23, 18:06 - Magreth EWYL22E0838: Noted
28/12/23, 18:26 - Unknown: To be on a safer side. Connect with the students on WhatsApp personally. Once they fill the form. Then *give them resources and information about Edoofa*.

*Train them about the process* so they are informed completely when the admission counselors will contact them and also, *we will have proof that yes you have explained it all.*
28/12/23, 18:27 - Unknown: Now that the time is over, we are wrapping up our today's scheduled session.
28/12/23, 18:27 - Unknown: Have a wonderful day and keep me updated about the progress in the project work.
28/12/23, 18:37 - Magreth EWYL22E0838: Will do
28/12/23, 20:17 - Unknown: Okay.
03/01/24, 14:27 - Magreth EWYL22E0838: Greetings of the day
03/01/24, 14:28 - Magreth EWYL22E0838: I'm here for my wednesday lesson
03/01/24, 15:55 - Unknown: _Welcome to the *first Wednesday Lesson* of the year 2024_
I hope this message finds you well and ready for an enlightening session.

22/01/24, 17:07 - Unknown: okay Magreth. That can surely be there. But it does not mean you will give up. Since there must be a few schools that are not a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. you can very well begin identifying those schools and then you can reach out to them.

01/02/23, 19:29 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

Happy Learning!
