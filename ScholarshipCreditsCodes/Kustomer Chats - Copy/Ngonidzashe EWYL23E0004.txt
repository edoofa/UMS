28/03/23, 20:10 - Ngonidzashe EWYL23E0004: Interesting notes.
28/03/23, 21:56 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Ngonidzashe!
How are you?
28/03/23, 21:57 - Ngonidzashe EWYL23E0004: I'm doing well, Ms. Saloni.
28/03/23, 22:00 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
28/03/23, 22:00 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
28/03/23, 22:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
28/03/23, 22:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
28/03/23, 22:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
28/03/23, 22:01 - Ngonidzashe EWYL23E0004: Yes.
29/03/23, 00:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for the delayed response, I was occupied in an internal meeting with the team with was to be attended as a priority about our visit starting tomorrow till Saturday.
As informed, no sessions will be held during this time and we will begin afresh from next week onwards where I will be sharing some crazy and interesting insights with you.
But this will only be done, we you will NOT MISS these *THREE THINGS*:
1) Timely submission of the Wednesday lesson and weekend activity
2) Daily following the ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', the absence of which can lead to not sharing of weekly lessons and activities with you
3) and most importantly, *PROGRESS ON PROJECTS*

I will be tracking the progress on _Monday_.
I completely know that these two weeks, we might not have dedicated discussions on the projects. So in my absence, I want that you think in-depth about *the project you are doing, revising the targets for the same, and completing it*.
I would really be emotional and happy that in a few months, many of the new edoofians will be joining our Indian family here. And honestly, I will be happier that we start preparing now for the future because growth is not measured in one day. We need to work hard consistently and dedicatedly.

Like I always say ‘1 step daily means 1 step UP. 0 step daily means 1 step DOWN’.
I trust you, just believe in yourself.
29/03/23, 00:50 - Ngonidzashe EWYL23E0004: Okay. Thank you.
29/03/23, 00:51 - Ngonidzashe EWYL23E0004: Have a wonderful time visiting the Edoofians.

03/04/23, 18:54 - Saloni Rastogi: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

07/04/23, 21:03 - Ngonidzashe EWYL23E0004: From the Wednesday Lesson, I understood that consistency is the very trait that is implied when we talk about not giving up. Having goals and consistently and determinedly working on them is the path to success. One who would succeed in life has to have consistency. It is because of consistency that we get ahead in any area of our lives, be it our education our careers and the market. We can actually achieve more with consistency. And as we regularly do a task, we gain muscle memory to do actions and tasks that we need to lay the foundation for our future success.
07/04/23, 21:06 - Ngonidzashe EWYL23E0004: As for the project, I had reached out to one of the school heads. However, I could not proceed with the scheduled meeting because I didn't have the resources required to communicate with him. I had rescheduled our conversation for during the day, that is today, but he might get more occupied during this Easter holiday.
07/04/23, 21:09 - Ngonidzashe EWYL23E0004: So I need to move quickly to at least not miss my window for this week.
07/04/23, 22:27 - Saloni Rastogi: I completely agree with you and I am happy to see the consistency in your sharing your response.

Let me summarize the lesson for you.
▪️Consistency is the key to success in any aspect of life, and the same applies to a
student's skill development and career growth. 
▪️Firstly, consistency in studies is crucial for a student's academic success. This not only helps students to cover the syllabus in time but also ensures that they have a clear understanding of the concepts. 
▪️Secondly, consistency in practice is vital for developing skills. 
▪️Lastly, consistency in learning is crucial for career growth. 

Consistent studies, practice, and learning are essential for achieving academic success, developing skills, and staying ahead on the job market
07/04/23, 22:27 - Saloni Rastogi: With this, I would dedicate the session today on the EWYL Line for the discussion of:
1) Wednesday's lesson on consistency
2) Project discussion
07/04/23, 22:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Okay, don't worry, let me share the resources with you.
07/04/23, 22:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy Good Friday⛪!
Hope you are doing well.
On this day, the Lord made a great sacrifice and freed us all from sins. Let us all take a moment and thank our Lord for all the love He has blessed us with. I am sure this might be a big day for you, hope to worship Him with all your heart and soul⚡
