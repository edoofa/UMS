 As we witness the remarkable progress in AI, we ponder its potential to transform our lives and simultaneously question if it will replace us
15/11/23, 12:53 - Thrive EWYL23E0678: Im good and you
16/11/23, 11:36 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are well,

I hope you are all excited for this journey, on this note since you completed your initial orientation yesterday, I am sharing this week's Wednesday wisdom with you so that you do not miss out on anything.
16/11/23, 11:36 - Aditi Kapoor: Wednesday wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

18/11/23, 14:47 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one â€“ it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!

21/11/23, 13:15 - Thrive EWYL23E0678: Eyes pain
21/11/23, 13:15 - Thrive EWYL23E0678: My eyes are itching

21/11/23, 13:25 - Thrive EWYL23E0678: I think the only challenge I can talk about ,when I was form 5 first term I was at government school and teachers were not attending lessons sort of strike but it was not because they stayed in their base rooms the whole day ,So I decide to read alone ,doing researches and going to extra lessons until the day I transfered from government school to private school
21/11/23, 13:29 - Aditi Kapoor: t's commendable that you took the initiative to continue your studies independently by reading alone, conducting research, and attending extra lessons. Self-directed learning can be a valuable skill, and it seems like you made the most of a difficult situation.
21/11/23, 13:34 - Thrive EWYL23E0678: Yes it was ,but I'm happy for that because made me to know as for me I must not rely on a person 100%  because we don't know what will gonna happen tomorrow
