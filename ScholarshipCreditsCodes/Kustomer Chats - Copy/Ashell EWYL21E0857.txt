11/10/22, 19:57 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Therefore I am sharing the Wednesday Lesson with you Today.
Also, Since, I am sharing this one day late, I am extending the deadline to Saturday at 9 AM from Friday at 6 PM.
20/10/22, 16:09 - Unknown: Hello, My Proud Edoofian.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

16/07/22, 19:25 - Ashell EWYL21E0857: The story of Patrice the successful south African entrepreneur had moved me to edges .
It taught me not much in words to explain but has managed to change the mindset
Though Patrice had a degree in law , he had the zeal to learn more about an area which was out of his specialized job 
He read books and research more about mining 
While he was working as a lawyer , He committed himself to the growth of the firm and made him recognized which one outstanding fact about himself 
Excellent Management of operations and finance can go a long way in making a business a success regardless of it's size 
Moreover despite the challenges faced by patrice such as lack of funding and the banks couldn't give loan to him because of race, He did not give up _patience

Question 1 
Is it possible and learn programing at 29 from sratch and search for descent job 
It has come to the best of my understanding that enormous is the difference between impossible and difficult.
It is possible to learn programing at 29 years old from scratch and search for a descent job nevertheless it is difficult in the sense that it learning on its own takes its own time and looking for a job might be time consuming 
 

Question 2
Whre can I learn programing 

In such events whereby one wishes commence with programing Especially coming from a background with no idea of programing , it will be wise to consider a more dedicated and experienced platforms for  such skills 
Which is a more reason why I would personally recommend skooqs .dedicated and experienced to give one a set skill which can accommodate him years down the line 
To take you from the dust to reach the highest star in programing u need a rocket which can take you there safely and secured , skooqs
20/07/22, 05:00 - Unknown: Ashell, Can you please share this to the Skooqs group?

21/07/22, 20:45 - Unknown: Let me share one sample answer with you.
This does not contain Skooqs but make sure that your answer does, okay?
21/07/22, 20:45 - Unknown: AE isn't difficult, as such, it's just fiddly and time-consuming. Obviously you need to know what to do because you do it but there's not a whole lot more than 'applying effects, in a certain way, to certain frames or parts of a frame of a video'. Improving Motion Graphics (Cough cough, Youtube) However, After Effects opens many more doors for typography, visuals, and 3D animations that are leaps and bounds cooler than anything you can do in Premiere. Using After Effects for graphics alone is worth the time spent learning the software
21/07/22, 20:53 - Unknown: Also, Ashell, Can you please share the photo of your EWYL certificate with me?
21/07/22, 20:57 - Ashell EWYL21E0857: Ok sir

Feedback on Wednesday wisdom lesson 

My father always tell mi that always be a student in any arena of ur Life so tht you will be an all rounder in any arena of ur life 
So I always take every chance of learning as a turn around 
Very wise and moving words from Ms Davi which people should consider in their journey to strive for success
Complaining and blaming are not evidence of special insight or wisdom nor a pointer towards analytic rigour rather they are evidence of weakness and irresponsible 
Moreover , the way to success is always not a paved road rather it is filled with ups and downs which must as individuals overcome to give a testimony
Adversity is always pregnant with opportunities and challenge is a channel to greater things.Your misery could be trampoline tht you can use to bounce to your greater station 

This has been a wonderful lesson to me sir which I hope to implement for long term benefits towards my journey of educational and professional success
23/07/22, 18:16 - Unknown: Good Morning, Proud Edoofian ?
I hope that you are doing well
23/07/22, 18:21 - Unknown: I am very glad to see your submission.
If you have to point out one major learning from this lesson.
May I know what it would be?
24/07/22, 03:31 - Ashell EWYL21E0857: I am a proud edoofian 
The major lesson I learnt was tht I shouldn't complain and blame others for my failures rather they should be a learning curve
