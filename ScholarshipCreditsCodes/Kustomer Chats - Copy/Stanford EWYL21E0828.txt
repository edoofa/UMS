04/08/22, 17:44 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: I'm a proud edoofian
04/08/22, 17:45 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: Hello. How are you today ?
04/08/22, 17:46 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

07/08/22, 21:01 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride.

10/08/22, 00:49 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: Weekend activity...
 1. How am I planning not to forget those 4 steps.
I will make those sticker that you attach on your door. That's what I usually do when I have some important information that I don't want to forget. Those stickers helps me because every time I woke up that's the first thing I see that's the first thing I read so I will never forget that information.

2. I think teaching can improve learning because obviously the person teaching you have more information to offer and have researched alot about the he or she is going to give you

14/07/22, 04:04 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: Hie. How are you?
14/07/22, 17:50 - Unknown: Hello Stanford!
How are you?
14/07/22, 17:50 - Unknown: I am doing absolutely fine, thanks for asking.
14/07/22, 18:00 - Unknown: Standord I am so happy with your response on the task and you know what Ms. Sanjana was also applauding your work. I felt so proud and grateful. Thank you for being such a bright student that every mentor would cherish.
14/07/22, 18:01 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: I'm doing okay
14/07/22, 18:01 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: From all the stories about successful people Ms. Davi have given us I noticed something, all those people have something common, they are all hard working sometimes things will not work as planned but they will never give up they keep on going until they make it. You know sometimes you have to learn from others mistakes or problems to avoid facing the same problems that person faced or you will know how to copy with that same situation why? because you will be strong and have the courage to keep on going since you know you are not the first person to face problems, like what someone said before, behind every successful person there is a story, most of these successful people they had to go through alot to get where there are right now. People tend to be only motivated by what a person own right now but that is not it you have to also learn from all the struggles successful people went through to be successful and this will keep you strong when ever you think of quiting. Like what Patrice Motsepe went through, he wanted to buy a money but he did have the money so he had to run around in a bid to source the money before the opportunity slip away, he went to the bank and they refused because he was the first black man to own a mine maybe they didn't believe in him I guess, but he did not give up just because someone is not supporting your dreams. Whenever you try to do something some people will oppose you and some will support you and you have to keep on believing in yourself you have to remain with a positive mind and you will definitely make it.
14/07/22, 18:02 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: Thank you for the compliment
14/07/22, 18:08 - Unknown: I will look forward to your response very soon Stanford.
14/07/22, 18:13 - Unknown: Stanford I am sharing tasks for today under your skooqs project.
14/07/22, 18:15 - Unknown: Now Stanford, each day I will be sharing two quora questions with you and you have to write answers to them.
14/07/22, 18:16 - Unknown: Content ✍

1. Why digital literacy is so important?2

? Make sure that follow the document given below before you write any answer
14/07/22, 18:22 - Unknown: ✅ `Content ✍`

2. How are game graphics developed?

`? Make sure that follow the document given below before you write any answer`
14/07/22, 18:25 - Unknown: If you have any doubt, please let me know.
14/07/22, 20:13 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: I have a question.
You are saying my answers should be reference to skooqs like are we advertising skooqs to the world I mean I visited the skooqs website and they have courses for kids(5 -18)yrs and I'm way above that but before you said skooqs is going to teach me a free course and I'm way old than the age group that they want and may I ask what kind of course skooqs going to provide for me.
15/07/22, 01:33 - Unknown: Stanford Inam very well aware of that. The reason I chose you for the course is that you are willing to pursue Btech in computer science and I am sure this will bring so much knowledge and will prove to be very insightful for you. Don't worry about the age.
15/07/22, 01:33 - Unknown: And I will inform you about the course ver soon.
15/07/22, 01:35 - Unknown: Do you have doubt as to what the task is that I have shared with you?
15/07/22, 02:54 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: To be honest I really don't know how to answer those questions but I will try and just to confirm you said doing those task will help me gain schoolarship credits right?
15/07/22, 02:54 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: Digital literacy is important because it boost one's engagement when trying to explain something e.g project, people will have a better understanding since your presentation will be clear and straight forward and digital literacy really helps one to have a creative mind, to be able to evaluate any information in a critical way and taking technology courses from online websites e.g skooqs can help you have codings skills and designing skills and that help you to be able to adapt to new technology.
15/07/22, 02:54 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: Game graphics are developed by creating 3D models of characters, environments and props, these models are then used to create images and animation for the character movements also 2D assests are used such as textures. If you have a vision or you want to create video games you should pursue technical courses across animation and game development and I encourage you to use E-learning websites like skooqs they offer more courses and you are guaranteed to be so experienced after each and every course you do.
15/07/22, 03:01 - Unknown: Yes Stanford, they will surely help you earn scholarship credits.
15/07/22, 03:04 - Unknown: Thanks for these amazing response Stanford.
15/07/22, 03:09 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: That video I gave you, you said edoofa will edit it can you please share with me the edited video
15/07/22, 03:09 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: You are welcome
15/07/22, 20:50 - Unknown: Hello, my proud EDOOFIAN!
Hope you are doing well.

From his dad’s small foray into entrepreneurship, Patrice Motsepe got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe’s success story is a remarkable one showing how curiosity, doggedness, perseverance, and the knack to exploit great opportunities as they come, can determine how successful or not, any individual could become. 
And this was all about our WEDNESDAY WISDOM.
Hope you have gone through it.
I am so excited to listen to your thoughts and views HERE.
15/07/22, 20:51 - Unknown: I will share the edited video as soon as they get approved, don't worry.
15/07/22, 21:05 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: Okay
15/07/22, 22:13 - Unknown: Till then Stanford please share your response to the Wednesday wisdom, I am very excited to discuss it with you.
15/07/22, 23:13 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: I did share my response yesterday
16/07/22, 01:02 - Unknown: Stanford I am asking for your response on the Wednesday lesson. I might have skipped them, can you please help me by resharing your response again?
16/07/22, 01:04 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: From all the stories about successful people Ms. Davi have given us I noticed something, all those people have something common, they are all hard working sometimes things will not work as planned but they will never give up they keep on going until they make it.

Whenever you try to do something some people will oppose you and some will support you and you have to keep on believing in yourself you have to remain with a positive mind and you will definitely make it.
16/07/22, 01:07 - Unknown: I read your response Stanford and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a WAY. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. We can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.

16/07/22, 18:53 - Unknown: I have seen in our conversation that you were so actively involved and followed the daily ritual of 'I am a proud EDOOFIAN' with so much enthusiasm and zeal but for the past few days, you have not done it. I hope everything is fine Stanford, I am very concerned.
16/07/22, 18:54 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: I'm fine thanks for asking
16/07/22, 18:56 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: I'm a proud edoofian but I have a question like do I have to say it everyday
16/07/22, 18:58 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

16/07/22, 19:00 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: I am a proud edoofian
16/07/22, 19:01 - Unknown: Yes Stanford, you have top say it everyday.

16/07/22, 19:02 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today Stanford, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
16/07/22, 19:02 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
16/07/22, 23:30 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: Okay now I get the sense and I will make sure to say I'm proud edoofian every morning
16/07/22, 23:31 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride.

19/07/22, 20:24 - Unknown: What about you?
19/07/22, 20:58 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: I want to discuss about the weekend task, I was able to do it I didn't have anyone to ask about fast growing industry\/sector\/business in Zimbabwe, you what no one in my family work in industries or have any knowledge about that and also I didn't have data bundles to research about the same so it was really difficult for me to do the weekend task.
19/07/22, 20:58 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: I'm fine thanks for asking
19/07/22, 22:27 - Unknown: No worries Stanford, I completely understand that.
If not a SWOT analysis of any growing industry, you can share a SWOT analysis of yourself. You are a growing leader of the future and before you start leading this ship towards your bright future, you should know what are your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities that you can utilize and threats that should look after.
20/07/22, 16:03 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: Hie. How are you today?

23/07/22, 20:08 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Stanford!
How's your day going?
23/07/22, 20:11 - Unknown: Stanford I am extremely sorry, I did not acknowledge your understanding to the last wednesday's lesson.
23/07/22, 20:11 - Unknown: I was going through our conversation and I guess it just got missed.
23/07/22, 20:14 - Unknown: I am really glad to hear your understanding of the Lesson. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY* . They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost up, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.
23/07/22, 20:15 - Unknown: Also Stanford you have not submitted your own SWOT analysis as a part of last weekend's activity since you were unable to research on any fast-growing industry around you. I hope you remember that.
23/07/22, 20:20 - Unknown: Along with this Stanford, Ms. Sanjana was giving me feedback on the quora answers that you submitted and she shared with me a few things that were missing in your responses:
1. the length of the answers has to be from 150 words to 180 words, they can not be less than 150 words
2. a mention of skooqs in all your answers is a must, please make sure you mention skooqs in all the content you write

As for your previous quora answers that you have submitted, I have corrected and updated all 6 answers from my end so that you don't have any backlog and I can evaluate all your answers in depth.
23/07/22, 20:21 - Unknown: I am sharing the tasks for today Stanford. From today onwards, we will have to increase the number of questions so that we have finished early and have enough time to evaluate our content. I hope you are okay with this.

24/07/22, 17:03 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: 1. How can you start learning programming. 
The best way to start program if you have reliable Internet access is by doing online lessons. Using E learning is quick way because you will have access to much information like basic programming tutorials you find them online and these tutorials are really helpful and you can grasp every concept not to mention that you will also have access to many programming questions and answers that you can evaluate yourself and improve you programming skills. The best way to learn online is through YouTube watching tutorials and also using online learning websites like skooqs you can get a lot of information from that website because they began from basic program upto a level which you will be the best.
24/07/22, 17:03 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: 2. The best way for kids to start learning kid coding classes is by firstly teaching the kid how to use a laptop or a computer before moving to coding. After that the kid can now start to do one on one lessons with mentor that will teach the kid from basic programming. After a while on face to face with mentors the kid can now start to look for websites that can improve his or her skills preferably Skooqs since it have a lot to offer in terms of technology especially to kids of age 9-18 years.
24/07/22, 17:03 - Stanford EWYL21E0828: 4.Good website for online learning : 1. Babble - Popular language learning program with live and app-based courses. 2. Lingopie - Experience immersive language learning through TV and movies.
3. Skooqs - provide online courses for kids especially on the age range of 9-18 years they can learn some technical courses across coding, animation, game development etc. And also provide the kid with the best tutors that make sure every kid grasp every important concept and be successful in every course that he or she will be doing.
24/07/22, 17:05 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation.
