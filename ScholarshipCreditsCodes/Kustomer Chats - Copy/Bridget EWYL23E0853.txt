To ignite our spirits for today's session, let's reflect on these powerful words by Maya Angelou: 'You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.' Let's draw inspiration from these words as we embark on a journey of discovery and growth. Welcome, and let's make the most of our time together!

Let's dive in with a fresh motivational quote to ignite our enthusiasm:
"The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs
May these words fuel our passion and creativity as we delve into today's agenda. Excited to collaborate and make progress together!
27/11/23, 13:07 - Bridget EWYL23E0853: Good morning.
27/11/23, 13:07 - Unknown: I wanted to bring to your attention a technical glitch that occurred last week, resulting in a repetition of the Saturday activity.
To ensure clarity and provide you with the most relevant content, I'll be sending the updated activity for this week shortly. You can take today's time in completing the task. I would appreciate your response before 9:30 am tomorrow. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
27/11/23, 13:09 - Bridget EWYL23E0853: Most welcome
27/11/23, 13:22 - Unknown: Now, let's shift attention to the three projects we've been discussing, particularly the

Community Building and African School Reforms initiatives.
27/11/23, 13:22 - Unknown: Could you provide an  update on the Community Building project? What progress have you made?


How many community-building forms have you successfully completed, and what is the typical number of students you have engaged with on average?
27/11/23, 13:27 - Bridget EWYL23E0853: I have tried reaching out to a number of students but non of them seem to be interested and some they said even though the scholarship is 50-100% off they still think that they won't manage.
27/11/23, 13:33 - Unknown: Okay Bridget. Thank you for sharing your response.
27/11/23, 13:34 - Bridget EWYL23E0853: Sure thing
27/11/23, 13:39 - Unknown: Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. I understand that some students may be hesitant despite the scholarship opportunities offered, expressing concerns about managing even with a 50-100% reduction.
It's crucial for us to address these concerns and provide clarity to help students make informed decisions. I suggest organizing an open discussion or information session where we can:
Clarify Scholarship Details:Clearly outline the benefits of the 50-100% scholarship, emphasizing the comprehensive support it provides and how it can significantly ease the financial burden.
Highlight Success Stories:Share success stories of students who have benefited from similar scholarships. Real-life examples can inspire confidence and demonstrate that it's indeed possible to manage and succeed.
27/11/23, 13:41 - Bridget EWYL23E0853: Your right.
27/11/23, 14:00 - Unknown: Have you encountered any other challenges that require my attention? I'm curious to hear your perspective on the project's current status.
27/11/23, 14:09 - Bridget EWYL23E0853: Alright, I have a certain corncen about the Idea culture, at first I did not put much attention into this issue but now that many are talking about this even the head teacher of the school I attended secondary education brought this to my attention, they said the country India as a whole does not value weman but they value men and if a woman is been harassed in front of people they do not do anything (like it's non of their corncen) So is this true?
27/11/23, 14:15 - Unknown: I understand that you have concerns about the treatment of women in India, and it's important to recognize that perceptions can vary based on individual experiences and perspectives. India, like any other country, is diverse, and cultural attitudes can differ across regions and communities.
27/11/23, 14:15 - Unknown: t's crucial to recognize that while challenges exist, India has made significant strides in promoting gender equality and respecting women's rights.
India has a rich cultural heritage that includes strong, empowered women throughout history. In recent decades, there have been substantial legal and social advancements aimed at safeguarding women's rights. Legislation addressing issues like dowry, domestic violence, and workplace harassment demonstrates a commitment to creating a safer environment for women.
27/11/23, 14:16 - Unknown: India's commitment to women's empowerment is evident in movements  promoting gender equality and encouraging open dialogue. Efforts are  ongoing to raise awareness, educate communities, and foster a culture  that values and respects women.
27/11/23, 14:21 - Bridget EWYL23E0853: Alright, thank you.
27/11/23, 14:23 - Unknown: You are welcome please!
27/11/23, 14:23 - Unknown: Now, turning our attention to the African School Reforms project. Could you share your insights on the current state of this project? What milestones have you reached?
27/11/23, 14:32 - Unknown: *So, we're wrapping up our session*.

Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.
27/11/23, 14:34 - Bridget EWYL23E0853: Most of the local schools around here are government institutions and most of them does not pay more than the amount you adviced so they said most of them will not manage and it was about the issue of not taking women as the they add value to the country, but I won't stop there I will keep on reaching out to different schools.
27/11/23, 16:41 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL
