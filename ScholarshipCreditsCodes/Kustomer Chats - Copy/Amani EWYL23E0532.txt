11/09/23, 15:58 - Amani EWYL23E0532: I was working on my own projects; I apologise if you got me wrong!
11/09/23, 15:59 - Ananya: Okay, I thought you were talking about EWYL projects.
11/09/23, 16:01 - Amani EWYL23E0532: I love working on projects because they keep me occupied, and I gain more skills along with practising my discipline.
11/09/23, 16:05 - Ananya: That is lovely, May I know if you worked on the EWYL projects?
11/09/23, 16:15 - Amani EWYL23E0532: Yes; from where we stopped by, we were waiting for the school leader to give me a time so that I could take him through the program.
11/09/23, 16:16 - Amani EWYL23E0532: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.

 üìöSolo Scholar vs. Group Guru - What's your study style? üí°We're curious about how our community learns best.

Drop a comment below and share your preferred study method
15/09/23, 14:31 - Amani EWYL23E0532: Precisely what time is it in CAT?
15/09/23, 14:33 - Amani EWYL23E0532: Group study can be a lot of fun because I get to work with others and learn from each other. I can share ideas, ask questions, and help each other understand the material better. Plus, it's a great way to stay motivated and accountable. However, in some cases, I prefer studying alone because I can focus better without distractions; especially when I'm doing some reading and so forth.
15/09/23, 19:45 - Ananya: It sounds like you have a balanced approach to studying. Group study can indeed be enjoyable and productive for collaborative learning and motivation. Yet, recognizing the need for solitary study to maintain focus and reduce distractions, especially for tasks like reading, is equally important.

18/09/23, 15:38 - Ananya: How's your day going so far? Did you have a nice weekend?

Your session is about to start, and during it, we'll be assessing your participation and progress.
18/09/23, 15:40 - Amani EWYL23E0532: My day is going quite fast. I'm currently on my visa process, which can be very overwhelming. But so far I'm great.
18/09/23, 15:40 - Ananya: Okay, How is it going so far?
18/09/23, 15:43 - Amani EWYL23E0532: So, I was given a list of the documents that are required for the visa application, and so far, I have some, but I'm still looking for the rest.
18/09/23, 15:43 - Amani EWYL23E0532: Lately, I've always been receiving emails from the school which I'm grateful for.
18/09/23, 15:45 - Ananya: That is wonderful to know.
18/09/23, 15:45 - Amani EWYL23E0532: Thank ma'am!
18/09/23, 15:45 - Amani EWYL23E0532: Thank you *
18/09/23, 15:46 - Ananya: May I know why did you not come on Saturday to collect your activity?
18/09/23, 15:48 - Amani EWYL23E0532: I thought I needed welcome remarks to start a session, ma'am.
18/09/23, 15:50 - Ananya: Amani, You have not followed your daily ritual on a daily basis.
18/09/23, 15:52 - Amani EWYL23E0532: Apparently, I misunderstood the rules; my apologies. I take full responsibility for my inconsistency.
18/09/23, 15:55 - Ananya: Every morning you need to follow the ritual okay?
18/09/23, 15:58 - Amani EWYL23E0532: Every day?
18/09/23, 16:01 - Ananya: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.
18/09/23, 16:01 - Ananya: May I know if you remember this point?
18/09/23, 16:06 - Amani EWYL23E0532: Yes, ma'am, I've recalled the point.
18/09/23, 16:11 - Ananya: It says you need to perform everyday right?
18/09/23, 16:12 - Amani EWYL23E0532: Yes, yes, very well noted.
18/09/23, 16:13 - Ananya: I would now like to know where we are on the projects.
18/09/23, 16:20 - Amani EWYL23E0532: Yes, of course! The projects are on hold for now due to a very tight schedule. I want to work on these projects with all my consciousness on board. So far, I'm simply doing reposts from Edoofa posts and stories, only to gather the audience. Meanwhile, I have contacted 5 of my friends who graduated recently.
18/09/23, 16:42 - Ananya: Do you mean you have kept it on hold/
18/09/23, 16:44 - Amani EWYL23E0532: I have not yet created the group. That's the point I'm highlighting; the reason being, I need to follow it up. 

Please let me know if I'm on the wrong lane.
