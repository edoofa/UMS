17/11/23, 16:35 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: Alright this week was a very hectic week for me l was preparing for my last Examinations  but starting from Monday l will be free and l will open up community groups so as to inform other students who wants to fulfill be their dreams. 

I am also thinking of doing the print outs messages about Edoofa Scholarship Program which will have all the necessary information of Edoofa that l learnt from the directors , my counsellor and my mentor . I think this will be easy for the students or Headmasters to read and have full knowledge about Edoofa Scholarship program    as compared to read the information on the phone where there will be different social media disturbing activities .
17/11/23, 16:40 - Aditi Kapoor: I appreciate your hard work and dedication, especially during your hectic week of preparing for your last examinations. It's great to hear that starting from Monday, you'll have the time to open up community groups and share valuable information about Edoofa with other students aiming to fulfill their dreams.
17/11/23, 16:41 - Aditi Kapoor: Your idea of creating printed messages with comprehensive information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program is fantastic. It provides a tangible and easily accessible resource for students and headmasters to gain a full understanding without distractions from social media activities. If there's anything specific you'd like assistance with or if you have further plans you'd like to discuss, feel free to share. Wishing you much success in your community outreach efforts!
17/11/23, 17:00 - Aditi Kapoor: Wrapping up our discussion, I'd like to express how wonderful our conversation has been, and I'm eagerly anticipating our next interaction.
17/11/23, 17:05 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: Thank you so much , have a great day

18/11/23, 14:47 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one – it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
18/11/23, 18:58 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: Thank you so much 

I am very sorry for late responses l don't know what is happening with our lines , network is tripping . They said they are upgrading the econet lines' system
18/11/23, 19:26 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: During my ordinary level's Zimsec Examinations.l wrote mathematics with a lot of confidence, knowing that l was very good when it comes to this subject. Unfortunately , when the results came l had failed mathematics with a  very worst symbol. I cried each and every day, isolated myself from other children, depressed and very stressed . I even lost my weight . My family comforted me every day , counselling me with warm messages but at that point my mind was not responding to those messages . I had contradicting ideas and views towards my parent's advices . My father told me that he is there to support me and to pay for my examination fees even if l was to write mathematics several times . This message showed me that  my family is the best and my dad is my human diary . My family advised me to write mathematics again saying that it wasn't the end of my life . I wrote mathematics again, working very hard , praying to God , doing group discussions with my lesson mates.Suprisingly , l passed mathematics . I learnt that in life we are here on earth to be corrected from our mistakes. I also learnt that failure is a temporary condition what makes it permanent is giving up .

21/11/23, 15:39 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: Greetings to you! 

Yes l am ready for the session
21/11/23, 15:43 - Aditi Kapoor: Overcoming a significant setback in failing a mathematics exam, I faced depression and isolation. Despite family support, it was a personal struggle. My father's unwavering support and encouragement motivated me to try again. Through hard work, prayer, and group discussions, I succeeded in the retake, realizing that failure is temporary and perseverance is key to success. The experience taught me the value of learning from mistakes and the importance of not giving up in the face of challenges.
21/11/23, 15:45 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: Wow l admire the way you express my challenge
21/11/23, 15:48 - Aditi Kapoor: Thank you for your kind words.
21/11/23, 15:49 - Aditi Kapoor: So let's now dive into the session with the updates on your project's please.
21/11/23, 15:51 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: I opened a group today KUDZAI/ADITI/21NOV with 17 participants . So l am still adding other students so that the group will have 20- 25 students .
21/11/23, 15:52 - Aditi Kapoor: That's amazing, so have you started sending messages in the group for community building?
21/11/23, 15:54 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: Not yet, in the evening l will introduce my self to the students not forgetting my mentor .l will also inform the students to abide with the group's rules so that the information that l will start sharing with them in the evening will not be disturbed by different student' s messages
21/11/23, 15:56 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: I am also planning to start by defining what is really meant by the term Edoofa Scholarship Program and also  comparing universities in Zimbabwe with that under the Edoofa Scholarship Program so that they will have a better understanding .


Is this good ?
21/11/23, 15:59 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay so I would recommend that you do not introduce me as your mentor and you yourself take charge of the whole group and be the guide that the students need.
21/11/23, 16:00 - Aditi Kapoor: It's an amazing idea of comparing universities under the Edoofa scholarship program.
21/11/23, 16:02 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: Alright , thank you for this information
21/11/23, 16:03 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: Sure!
21/11/23, 16:09 - Aditi Kapoor: Sure!
Also, may I have an update on the School's project please.
21/11/23, 16:17 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: Maam l just heard like you said there is no sequence which is to be followed when doing the projects so l just decided to start with the community building then l will go to different schools and l believe they will be done with their Examinations . I went to my former school twice but the headmaster said it will be very much good for me to come and discuss with him about Edoofa Scholarship Program having face to face interactions. So l just thought of starting   community building project
21/11/23, 16:19 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: My headmaster said l will come after the ZIMSEC Examinations and also when the signing out of the 2023 candidates is done so that he will understand everything without any pressure or disturbances
21/11/23, 16:19 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, I understand and surely it's a great idea but please ensure that after the exams you surely reach out to the headmaster after the exams.
21/11/23, 16:20 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: Alright, l will definitely do so
21/11/23, 16:22 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, great!
21/11/23, 16:23 - Aditi Kapoor: So Kudzai, may I know if you are facing any issues regarding your projects?
21/11/23, 16:25 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: So far so good Maam

24/11/23, 15:32 - Aditi Kapoor: Are you excited to begin today's session✨
24/11/23, 15:34 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: Greetings to you Maam , yes l am very excited to begin today's session.
24/11/23, 15:35 - Aditi Kapoor: Amazing, so let's begin  the session with your understanding of the Wednesday Lesson.
24/11/23, 15:37 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: Alright Maam
24/11/23, 15:38 - Aditi Kapoor: Great!
24/11/23, 15:43 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: I understood that to fulfill your goals or wants you go through difficult phases in life , some of the challenges they can even stop you from fulfilling your goals for example Michael Jordan , he was sent away from the school' s basket ball team right ,but this didn't stop him from fulfilling his goal to be a basket ball player but he kept on working hard until he won the best awards of being the best basketball player right . 

In other terms ,this means despite the challenges we face as students they should not stop us from following our dreams . We should find ways to overcome all the problems .
24/11/23, 15:47 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: I also learnt that even the successful people l know , they passed through many challenges right .Those challenges made them to be who are they now . They were being corrected from their mistakes and problems right . For example Michael Jordan 

Sorry for just using Michael Jordan as an example , l love basketball a lot right😊
24/11/23, 15:51 - Aditi Kapoor: Your understanding is insightful and inspiring. Recognizing that fulfilling goals often involves navigating through challenging phases is a valuable perspective. The example of Michael Jordan's resilience, being initially removed from the school's basketball team but persistently working hard to become one of the best basketball players, illustrates the importance of perseverance in the face of obstacles.
Your takeaway about not allowing challenges to deter us from pursuing our dreams is profound. It's true that many successful individuals, including those you admire, have faced and overcome numerous challenges. These challenges, as you rightly pointed out, contribute to their growth, correction of mistakes, and ultimately shape them into the successful individuals they are today.
Using Michael Jordan as an example is a great way to convey the message, especially if you have a passion for basketball.
24/11/23, 15:54 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: This is totally true
24/11/23, 16:00 - Aditi Kapoor: Great, so now let's move onto the project discussions and I must say you are doing well also I would like to have updates on the School's project as well.
24/11/23, 16:05 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: Yes Ma'am l told you about the Examinations of different schools right , today is the final Examination day . So on Monday l will make sure that l have spread the Edoofa printouts messages to at least three schools and also not forgetting to explain this program to them .
24/11/23, 16:12 - Aditi Kapoor: Superb Kudzai, great idea and a great initiative.
24/11/23, 16:14 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: Thank you Ma'am 😊
24/11/23, 16:18 - Aditi Kapoor: Also Kudzai, may I know if you follow Edoofa's page on Instagram?
24/11/23, 16:19 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854: Not yet on Instagram Maam , l follow it on Facebook
24/11/23, 16:20 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, so make sure you follow it on Instagram as well.
