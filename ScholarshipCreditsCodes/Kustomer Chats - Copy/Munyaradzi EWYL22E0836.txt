I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
16/01/23, 23:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.

- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.

So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
18/01/23, 21:05 - Munyaradzi EWYL22E0836: I believe communication is key.In this i have created a WhatsApp group to inform any friends or parents about Edoofa. Unfortunately i realised that   most of my friends had already been engaged to other organizations and some even with Edoofa.So i decided to create a page on Facebook that would reach out to more than a thousand friends i have on Facebook which is more than the numbers on my contact list or in the group.
18/01/23, 21:06 - Munyaradzi EWYL22E0836: With this i decided to use both ends as a way to reach out to people even without destroying the group
18/01/23, 21:07 - Munyaradzi EWYL22E0836: I'm looking forward to create Ads through WhatsApp business account.
19/01/23, 22:32 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Munyaradzi!

20/01/23, 00:21 - Munyaradzi EWYL22E0836: The material i have set out on the WhatsApp group
20/01/23, 00:28 - Munyaradzi EWYL22E0836: This has been my responses in the group
20/01/23, 00:35 - Munyaradzi EWYL22E0836: About the Wednesday Wisdom
I have to admit this has been such an interesting piece.I got to understand how best it is to give an ear so that you get to comprehend what's around or being sayed around one's self by listening.This only doesn't go without the right deliverance in choice of words better stated as using the right wording in the document.Most of all i understood what is building a hierarchy in asking good questions. I'll say from this i have learned and can clearly state when i was wrong before for example first time I interacted with my Edoofa counsellor ,it was hectic as i bolstered one question after the other but now i remember how he replied me with saying one question at a time and this created more  room to which bow we can say we chose the decision of studying abroad
21/01/23, 21:02 - Munyaradzi EWYL22E0836: Greetings of the day Ms Saloni!

23/01/23, 21:30 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings to all!
How was your weekend?

We gained knowledge on how to ask intelligent questions. I'd like you to share with us any two questions you'd like to ask yourself as part of your Saturday submission. The questions that you may have been hesitant to make, the questions that put you in a difficult situation, the inquiries that will have a significant impact on your career and future.

In our discussion today, we will talk about:
1) the two questions you will raise
2) your progress on projects
23/01/23, 21:31 - Munyaradzi EWYL22E0836: The weekend we as great thank you
23/01/23, 21:32 - Saloni Rastogi: I completely agree with you that Ms. Leah Nduati's webinar will be very learning and interesting.
23/01/23, 21:39 - Munyaradzi EWYL22E0836: I will be in touch
23/01/23, 21:52 - Munyaradzi EWYL22E0836: Question i have for myself are as follows

1.Now that i have heard an understood how best i can ask questions, I'm asking myself how do i get to be the best in asking the right questions in line of topics and be able to deliver even if I'm the one asked . Secondly I consider others before me so I'm asking myself how as well can I deliver the same knowledge to others and make the world a better place
23/01/23, 22:32 - Munyaradzi EWYL22E0836: For the project i can say I was focusing on community building since results have come out and many will be on the verge of deciding what they'll do with their career  ,later i then assessed and saw you as the EDOOFA team might be held up with work right now of admission and many more the time period of them approaching the application of new students might be delayed so i switched to focus some energy on Meeting the African Schools Principals until we start to pursue the application forms of the new students
23/01/23, 22:53 - Saloni Rastogi: So how do you think you can best educate people on basics and why is it important?
23/01/23, 22:54 - Munyaradzi EWYL22E0836: That i can deliver to people
23/01/23, 22:55 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, that should be known to people.
23/01/23, 23:00 - Munyaradzi EWYL22E0836: Apart from this as my mentor Ms i have a question
24/01/23, 17:27 - Munyaradzi EWYL22E0836: Good morning Ms?
The ritual of us as proud EDOOFIANS is one i have found to be a necessity since i felt being welcomed and comfortable to the Edoofa family after the Webinar yesterday with Ms Leah Nduati.Much has been learned on the skills required in finding jobs on the market and how one is expected to be.Once again after all this with a smile I'm delighted to say I am a proud EDOOFIAN.
24/01/23, 17:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up.
