01/08/22, 17:11 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times pere week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these att

You know I had an amazing day yesterday. I am very excited to tell you how it all went.
First I put a red spot on my brother's forehead, it is called 'teeka'. Then we stick some rice to that spot and after that, I tied a beautiful decorative rakhi (a thread or ribbon) on this wrist.
Sisters do that for the long life of their brothers and to that, the brothers promise to protect their sisters.
Later we have delicious sweets and exchanged presents.

How was your long weekend?

Let me educate you about the Indian independence day which was yesterday due to which we had a long weekend!
Independence Day, in India, is a national holiday celebrated annually on August 15. Independence Day marks the end of British rule in 1947 and the establishment of a free and independent Indian nation. It also marks the anniversary of the partition of the subcontinent into two countries, India and Pakistan, which occurred at midnight on August 14–15, 1947.

your mission in the professional world. We all know high-profile individuals with a personal\r. It is important to build a personal brand ecause it is a representation of you that others are presented\r
with when they look for you online, as well as the image that you choose to project in face-toface interactions.So actively creating a personal brand for yourself allows you to have a say in how you market\r
yourself and gives you control in crafting an accurate picture of your identity, rather than it\r
happening purely by default.it’s essential that your brand is\r
genuine and an accurate depiction of who you are.\r
There are several steps one should follow when building a personal brand , firstly figure out what you are passionate at Your personal brand must align with, and reflect, your likes and interests. What is it that you\r
want to do, and what attributes and qualities express your passion.One should grow  social footprints.Create profiles that reflect your passions on social networking platforms. Maximising your\r
LinkedIn profile to reflect your interests, skills and ambitions is essential. If you are active on\r
Facebook and Twitter.also make a plan for yourself How will you use your personal brand? Just as any commercial or corporate brand has plans,\r
goals and targets . The last step you should tell a story .One of the most effective ways to build a compelling personal brand is through narrative.
