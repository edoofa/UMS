I'm now sharing my understanding on the Wednesday Wisdom lesson.

I was greatly inspired by the lesson on the Think and grow rich book by Napoleon . His 13 principles are very important in one's life and they need to be maintained in one's journey to success. I liked the first , second , fifth and seventh most and they greatly inspired me. The lesson was very interesting to me. 

Have a good day ahead! 
Thank you

24/04/23, 16:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian, ready for a motivational monday?

In a remote village, there lives a hardworking farmer who owns a farm. Over the years his grapery yields rich crops, and the farmer is very successful. He has three sons, who are young and energetic but never worry about working. As the farmer grows older, he begins to worry about his sons‚Äô future.

Then he becomes very ill and feels that his death is coming soon. He calls his sons and says,

‚ÄúDear sons, I see my death approaching, but I want to share a secret before you all leave. These areas have treasure hidden inside. Dig the whole area after my death, to find it. ‚Äù

The old farmer died. The sons start digging for money without leaving any part of the field but nothing is found. In any case, digging their fields leads to healthier crops and results in higher incomes. These earnings make the sons realize what their father means.

What according to you is the moral of the story?

a. Hard work always pays off. The fruits of hard work are always sweet.
b. Be Selflessly kind
c. both a & b
