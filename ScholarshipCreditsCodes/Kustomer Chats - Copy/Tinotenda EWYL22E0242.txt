25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

28/07/22, 04:36 - Tinotenda EWYL22E0242: My name is Tinotenda Mandova
28/07/22, 19:47 - Unknown: \" Don’t worry about failure. Worry about the chances you miss when you don’t even try.\"

Hello my proud Edoofian! Greeting of the day.
28/07/22, 20:43 - Tinotenda EWYL22E0242: Am good sir and you
28/07/22, 21:20 - Unknown: I am also well Tinotenda. I just shared with you the yesterday's Wednesday wisdom on the EWYL group. Did you receive it?
28/07/22, 22:03 - Tinotenda EWYL22E0242: Yes l did
28/07/22, 23:49 - Unknown: Please share with me what you have understood from the lesson Tinotenda.
28/07/22, 23:56 - Tinotenda EWYL22E0242: Time management is the ability to use time effectively and productively
It is an art of having time to do everything you need without being stressed
It is working productively and prioritizing your time
 One has to understand the difference between urgent and important
 Urgent tasks demand immediate attention while important tasks matter
A priority matrix is used to best review a task of ur daily activity
 That is what I understood
29/07/22, 00:15 - Unknown: Really good to receive your work on the Wednesday wisdom. I am sure you enjoyed it and learnt how you should manage your time in order to get the best outcome right?
29/07/22, 00:18 - Tinotenda EWYL22E0242: Yes l did
29/07/22, 00:22 - Unknown: Tinotenda, the  distinction between urgent and important is the key to prioritizing your time and your workload, whether at work, at home or when studying.
It enables you to work out what to do first, and what can be left either until later, or not done at all. For example, if you leave an urgent but unimportant task, you may find that it becomes unnecessary.
29/07/22, 00:23 - Tinotenda EWYL22E0242: Thank you noted
29/07/22, 00:29 - Unknown: So Tinotenda, how do you believe you should put in your effort in making a schedule for your work on EWYL projects ?

Good day my proud Edoofian!! How are you today?
04/08/22, 20:00 - Unknown: Since you have selected 3, let me help you understand better the meaning of proud Edoofian. An Edoofian is a  strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian” 

This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
04/08/22, 22:27 - Tinotenda EWYL22E0242: Noted sir thank you

05/08/22, 00:30 - Unknown: Now Tinotenda, Did you read the super interesting story of 19 year old Gilbert Eugene Peters from Zimbabwe that I shared with you yesterday?

06/08/22, 02:01 - Unknown: Good to read your understanding of the lesson Tinotenda. The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years. The price is knowing that time is working on your side even when the results don’t show it.

11/08/22, 22:07 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
