Hope this message finds you in high spirits! üåü As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting‚ÄîI'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me‚Äîit's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! ü™î‚ú® If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! üéâ

Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head‚Äôs Contact.

18/03/23, 21:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings *my proud edoofian*!

Here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!
18/03/23, 21:52 - Saloni Rastogi: I am happy that you have got the contacts.

It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
18/03/23, 21:52 - Saloni Rastogi: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
18/03/23, 21:52 - Saloni Rastogi: So, This is what the First message should look like:
18/03/23, 21:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Mr.\/Mrs *School Head Name*

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result\/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

20/03/23, 21:45 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he‚Äôd received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he‚Äôd paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

‚ÄúYour honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,‚Äù he replied.

‚ÄúHow do you weight the butter then?‚Äù Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

‚ÄúYour honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I‚Äôve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it‚Äôs the baker.‚Äù
20/03/23, 23:02 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you please share your response on the weekend activity?
20/03/23, 23:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, now that the headmaster have responded you, let me share some crucial information that can be shared with the headmaster.
20/03/23, 23:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me tell you beforehand that the information sent below can be a lot to grasp at once. So I would suggest reading them gradually would help yu understand it better.
20/03/23, 23:05 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education   All.
20/03/23, 23:05 - Saloni Rastogi: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of lack of affordability and of employability in higher education. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!
20/03/23, 23:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Edoofa is a social for-profit organization that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready.

20/03/23, 23:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Now, It is time to explain with examples How Edoofa is revolutionizing the Education System on the African Continent. Examples create clarity. This is why they are used in all contexts as a tool to provide further understanding. When it comes to your conversation, examples play a significant role in your ability to effectively communicate the elements that you want the School Head to understand.
20/03/23, 23:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year.

27/03/23, 19:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn‚Äôt hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!
","transform":"
27/03/23, 21:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

As informed earlier, I was not available last week from Thursday to Friday and the organization was closed on Saturday and Sunday. So let's focus today's session solely on these three things:

1) Wednesday lesson + Weekend activity understanding
2) Whether you were able to complete last week's Projects targets?
3) What are the challenges you are facing in the projects?

Also, this week will be visiting our _Proud Indian Edoofians_ from Wednesday to Saturday. So, the sessions will be held at that time. And I will be very happy to share the updates of our visit with you as the days go by?
27/03/23, 22:03 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL22E0646: Ma'am on Wednesday you gave me our targets per week
27/03/23, 22:04 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL22E0646: And i didn't get the weekend activity
27/03/23, 22:05 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL22E0646: At the moment some headmasters are not responding some are suggesting time and not being available
27/03/23, 22:06 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL22E0646: And some of the head's contacts are a little bit hard to get but am working on it
27/03/23, 22:24 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL22E0646: The Wednesday lesson was so touchy as it   made me rethink and be wise on how to create wealth. Yes some people despise wealth and see it as something to be avoided but i see wealth as something that one should thrive to have for them to be somewhere in the world. As Wednesday Wisdom states , wealth should be created ethically as improvised and it should help others be of value. Yes some gain it at the expense of others , like what is currently happen world wide but instead people should be helped and see the ethical creation of wealth at another angle by having some sessions or seminars and the like
27/03/23, 22:44 - Saloni Rastogi: You have summed up your understanding really well, it reflects a lot of maturity and aspiration to excel in life.
I have read in-depth all your responses and I am glad to say that you have got the crucks of the lesson and activities super well.‚ú®
27/03/23, 22:46 - Saloni Rastogi: You did not receive the weekend activity because on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday you have not followed the daily ritual. May I know the reason behind this Tanyaradzwa?
27/03/23, 22:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share the screenshots of the chats with me where the headmasters are saying so?
27/03/23, 22:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, for every week, the targets are set. that is.
5 Company Connect forms in 1 week
or 
15 Community Building forms in 1 week
or
2 School forms in 1 week

29/03/23, 00:59 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for the delayed response, I was occupied in an internal meeting with the team with was to be attended as a priority about our visit starting tomorrow till Saturday.
As informed, no sessions will be held during this time and we will begin afresh from next week onwards where I will be sharing some crazy and interesting insights with you.
But this will only be done, we you will NOT MISS these *THREE THINGS*:
1) Timely submission of the Wednesday lesson and weekend activity
2) Daily following the ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', the absence of which can lead to not sharing of weekly lessons and activities with you
3) and most importantly, *PROGRESS ON PROJECTS*

I will be tracking the progress on _Monday_.
I completely know that these two weeks, we might not have dedicated discussions on the projects. So in my absence, I want that you think in-depth about *the project you are doing, revising the targets for the same, and completing it*.
I would really be emotional and happy that in a few months, many of the new edoofians will be joining our Indian family here. And honestly, I will be happier that we start preparing now for the future because growth is not measured in one day. We need to work hard consistently and dedicatedly.

Like I always say ‚Äò1 step daily means 1 step UP. 0 step daily means 1 step DOWN‚Äô.
I trust you, just believe in yourself.
30/03/23, 07:11 - Saloni Rastogi: The correct answer is A. Zambezi

The Zambezi River is the fourth-longest river in Africa, the longest east-flowing river in Africa and the largest flowing into the Indian Ocean from Africa.","transform":"

30/03/23, 20:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Dear Students,
I hope this message finds you well. As your EWYL progresses, it is important that you stay up to date with your assignments and coursework. In order to ensure that you are able to move forward with the new lessons, I want to remind you that you must complete all of your previous assignments by the end of this week.

It is essential that you take the time to thoroughly review and complete your previous assignments. Doing so will not only help you to understand the lesson better, but it will also prepare you for the upcoming lessons. Failure to complete the previous assignments may result in a delay of the new lessons, and ultimately, it may impact your EWYL progress.

Therefore, I urge you to make the completion of your previous assignments a priority. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to seeing your completed assignments and to sharing the new lessons with you soon.

Best regards,
Team EWYL","transform":"
