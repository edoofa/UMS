Hello sir how are you
13/08/22, 18:14 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

10/11/22, 17:52 - Unknown: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian,

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
