Ready for today’s Wednesday Wisdom?

Have you ever wondered what the one governing principle that governs all businesses might be? What is the name of the one value that every company considers to be crucial? Have you ever heard of something called the North Star Metric?

North Star Metric is a key business metric that reflects the core value a product delivers to its customers. It's a single, actionable metric that aligns all efforts towards achieving long-term growth. Let us learn about in greater detail, read the lesson carefully and we will connect in our upcoming scheduled session. 

Till then Happy learning!
09/03/23, 01:25 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: Thank you
09/03/23, 18:35 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: I am a proud Edoofian.
09/03/23, 18:37 - Aditi Kapoor: Dear Proud Edoofian,

I hope you are doing well. This message serves as a gentle reminder for your Wednesday lesson. It is important to continue learning and developing your skills in order to advance in your career. Please take some time to go through the lesson, take notes on any important information, and complete the assigned tasks. Remember, investing in yourself is always a wise decision.

Happy learning!","transform":"
09/03/23, 20:51 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: Thank you
09/03/23, 20:55 - Aditi Kapoor: Please share:
1) Wednesday lesson understanding
09/03/23, 20:56 - Aditi Kapoor: We will discuss the projects after you share your understanding of the lesson with me.
09/03/23, 21:02 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: I understood that North Star Metric is very crucial and important in  business as well as to a student because it helps to motivate and remind them goals.
09/03/23, 21:03 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: Not only that buh it also helps the both to achieve and accomplish their goals and leads to success
09/03/23, 22:17 - Aditi Kapoor: When setting direction to success you must make good choices on the path you are going to choose. 
Setting goals is the most important thing you can do in your life.
For us, the North Star Metric is achieving the target of 15 community-building forms at least a week and earning about $50 a month.
09/03/23, 22:18 - Aditi Kapoor: Coming to the project, So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
09/03/23, 22:19 - Aditi Kapoor: A] Through WhatsApp community groups:


STEP 1: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME\/MENTOR NAME\/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED
For eg: a student named Tendai who formed the group on 1st February will name it-
TENDAI\/MENTOR NAME\/1FEB2023
09/03/23, 22:19 - Aditi Kapoor: STEP 2: We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
09/03/23, 22:19 - Aditi Kapoor: As for attracting the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 5, and Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).


Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
09/03/23, 22:20 - Aditi Kapoor: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to STUDY IN INDIA with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

And in a very similar manner, you can repeat the same process with the Form 5 students as well.
09/03/23, 22:24 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: Alright
09/03/23, 23:22 - Aditi Kapoor: Have you formed the group?
09/03/23, 23:26 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: Yes I have
10/03/23, 00:36 - Aditi Kapoor: Let's have the discussion on Saturday, till then please keep working on the PROJECTS!

How are you?
11/03/23, 22:42 - Aditi Kapoor: Let me share some information that you can use to accelerate participation in the group.
11/03/23, 22:48 - Aditi Kapoor: Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of more than 3000 students from different countries.
11/03/23, 22:48 - Aditi Kapoor: Edoofa receives applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
11/03/23, 22:48 - Aditi Kapoor: Speaking specifically about your country Zimbabwe, Edoofa has more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. They are partnered with 150+ schools across Africa where they help the students get access to the scholarship seats. Edoofa is also associated with more than 250 Headmasters from different provinces, Chairman SDC, and other Educationists.
11/03/23, 22:49 - Aditi Kapoor: Their associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and was the Principal of Hartzell High School,  Mutare. Edoofa has collaborated with them for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already.
11/03/23, 22:49 - Aditi Kapoor: The Child of the DEO, Manicaland Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. United College of Education, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA and Respected Sir Adam Luthuli has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

12/03/23, 00:26 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: So in other words I can send this information on the group I created ?
13/03/23, 16:37 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: I am a proud Edoofian
13/03/23, 16:39 - Aditi Kapoor: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”
13/03/23, 20:49 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: 1. A North Star Metric is a single key performance indicator that represents the most important goals of a business. It helps businesses to drive their overall success and serves as a guidepost fir decision making and prioritisation.Hence this helps the business to stay focused in their goals 


2. My North Star Metric would be \"Educational Inquisition\" . This is because it would always remind me of the curiosity I have towards learning and would act as a main key in helping me to stay focused on my academics which would lead to personal growth.
13/03/23, 21:23 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Agnes!
How are you?
13/03/23, 21:23 - Aditi Kapoor: I am so happy to hear what you think about the _North Star metric, I am sure that we will be able to apply the same __motivation, enthusiasm, and zeal_ towards our *EWYL Program* and the *PROJECTS* . And channel all our energy into the right direction, that is in the _completion of our weekly target of getting *15 Community Building Forms* ._
13/03/23, 21:23 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, you can share all this information in the group.
13/03/23, 21:27 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: Im fine and urself
13/03/23, 21:27 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: Alright
13/03/23, 22:01 - Aditi Kapoor: So far Agnes, I see two major challenges:
1) you are not updating the group on the daily basis
2) Low number of participants in the group

May I know the challenges associated with this?
13/03/23, 22:16 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: Well it's really difficult to convince people to join the group because most people aren't really interested in the scholarship stuffa and they claim that they don't think Edoofa is real despite myself sending them evidence.
13/03/23, 22:20 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, tell me a few things.
13/03/23, 22:20 - Aditi Kapoor: Have you reached out to everyone in your school?
13/03/23, 22:20 - Aditi Kapoor: Are you a part of all form 5 and form 6's unofficial class groups?
13/03/23, 22:24 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: Well I went to a boarding school so those in Form 6 and 5 are currently at school
13/03/23, 22:25 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: I managed to talk to my classmates but most people say they can't afford and would rather go to the universities here
13/03/23, 22:25 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: And that's why I'm failing to have many participants in the group
13/03/23, 22:40 - Aditi Kapoor: I can understand that but in such a case you still have various ways:
1) please reach out to all your friends, peers, cousins, and neighbors, to help you get added to their schools' Form 5 and Form 6 class groups
2) Use social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram to spread word about Edoofa
3) Use Facebook groups, I am sharing a screenshot that will help you understand that their are various groups on Facebook that you can join  and share information about Edoofa and also forward the link of your WhatsApp group their.
13/03/23, 22:45 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: Thank you but I'm actually a Malawian not a Zimababwean but I'll surely research on Malawian groups
13/03/23, 23:08 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: Thank I will surely work on it
13/03/23, 23:09 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, reach out to all these group and start rigorous campaigning.
13/03/23, 23:10 - Aditi Kapoor: Even before that, consider the first two point out of the three.
13/03/23, 23:11 - Agnes EWYL22E1276: Alright I'm working on it
13/03/23, 23:23 - Aditi Kapoor: I would want that at the nd of the day you share a report with me on how it went and what will be your plans for tomorrow.

This week's Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the topic of \"Seeking Wealth, not Money or Status.\" This is an important lesson that will provide valuable insights into the pursuit of financial stability and success. During this lesson, we will explore the concept of wealth and its importance in building a sustainable financial future. We will discuss the difference between wealth, money, and status, and how each of these concepts plays a role in our lives.
I encourage you to read the lesson in detail and take notes to fully understand the material. It is important to engage with this topic and think critically about your own financial goals and aspirations.
By understanding the importance of seeking wealth over money or status, you can develop a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial success. I look forward to exploring this topic with you in more detail during our upcoming lesson.
