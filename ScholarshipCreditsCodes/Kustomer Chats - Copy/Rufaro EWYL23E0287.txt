13/07/23, 16:55 - Jasmine Kaur: While I go through your Wednesday Lesson, I would want you to update me on your progress on

1. Community Building -

2. African School Education Reform Mission project -
13/07/23, 17:01 - Rufaro EWYL23E0287: 1. Community Building: I have managed to only contact a few individuals who are still to send in their forms(I will do a round of follow ups after our session) 

2. African School Education Reform Mission project: I have managed to only inform the headmaster at my former high school over WhatsApp but i am still to head to the College and have a face to face conversation. I have also managed to get the contacts of the heads of other schools in my region such as Masiyephambili College as well as Speciss College(for these two i am yet to receive response via email and WhatsApp).
13/07/23, 17:07 - Jasmine Kaur: Why is the Progress so slow Rufaro?
13/07/23, 17:11 - Rufaro EWYL23E0287: I believe I am not being aggressive enough Ms Jasmine and i hope to tackle that. My apologies I will work harder ma’am.
13/07/23, 17:16 - Jasmine Kaur: You don't have to be aggressive Rufaro.
13/07/23, 17:18 - Rufaro EWYL23E0287: Aggressive may be the wrong word, but i feel I am approaching my projects in a casual manner
13/07/23, 17:19 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, that can be the reason. I can see this from the sessions also. 
You are supposed to submit your lesson and activity before your session. But you took almost an hour to write your lesson during the session.
13/07/23, 17:21 - Rufaro EWYL23E0287: I apologize ma’am this will all change
13/07/23, 17:24 - Jasmine Kaur: Well, I am very happy to hear this. As we conclude our session, I would like to appreciate your hard work and acknowledge that I can see that you are working very hard. Remember I am with you and you can share any challenge that you face without any hesitation.

19/07/23, 17:15 - Rufaro EWYL23E0287: Ms Jasmine, Lorent’s story has made me realise how the importance of consistency and hard work pays off. I am glad to know that through the projects, he has managed to gain a number of skills but the one that caught my eye was of self confidence. I do struggle with that and if knowing that pushing and working harder on my projects can tackle this obstacle that often discourages me to head for goal, then I certainly will do so. I carry Lorent’s message to the Edoofians with me that if effort is applied and I am diligent and enthusiastic about my education and everything i do, then i will definitely achieve my goals. Another thing is, I appreciate and find it absolutely wonderful that you put a tremendous effort towards Lorent and the Edoofians Ms Jasmine, it is wonderful to know that we are in good hands.

20/07/23, 14:31 - Rufaro EWYL23E0287: Wednesday wisdom 

For today's Wednesday Wisdom, I embarked on Student Leaders. The key to becoming an influential leader is to be dedicated, passionate and committed to making a positive impact in my community. 

I understand that to become a Student Leader, one must, Lead by example. The statement “Practice What You Preach” comes to mind. Being a role model to my peers will in turn inspire them to follow the same path and create a  culture of positive behavior.

I also understand that Building Relationships is another key strategy. Developing positive relationships helps to gain trust and respect, which enhances my influence as a student leader.

By expressing my ideas clearly, listening attentively to others, and adapting my communication style to different situations , i can gain the skill of effective communication. This is also essential to becoming a student leader. 

I learnt that being proactive and taking initiative shows essentiality of being a student leader and motivates others to get involved as well. This can be done by organizing events, initiating projects, or advocating for positive change in my community. 

To become a student leader, then one must know that true leadership is about empowering others to reach their full potential and by doing this I create a network of motivated individuals who can contribute to the betterment of your community. 

Embracing diversity and inclusion is another step towards student leadership. Respecting and embracing the diversity of my community, fostering an environment where everyone feels valued and included will display a sense of humility and openness. Who wouldn’t want such a leader? 

A significant part of being an influential student leader is actively engaging in community service. By volunteering at local organizations, organizing fundraisers, or participating in community clean-up projects, serving others demonstrates my commitment to making a positive difference. 

Leadership is an ongoing journey of learning and personal growth and by continuously learning and growing, I become a more effective and influential student leader.
20/07/23, 15:39 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Morning!

I hope you are having a blessed day so far. A brand new day awaits your remarkable potential and limitless possibilities. So, let your passion guide you, your determination push you, and your dreams inspire you to excel beyond expectations. With this, allow us to begin today's session. Are you ready for today's session?
20/07/23, 15:46 - Rufaro EWYL23E0287: Good morning, my day is pleasant and I hope yours is as well. We may begin today’s session.
20/07/23, 15:58 - Jasmine Kaur: While I go through your Wednesday Lesson, I want you to quickly answer these questions.

1. What are you currently doing in Community Building?
2. What are you currently doing in African School Education Reform Mission?
3. Discuss the Challenges that you are facing in Community Building.
4. Discuss the Challenges that you are facing in African School Education Reform Mission.
20/07/23, 16:33 - Rufaro EWYL23E0287: 1. In the Community Building Project I am currently in contact with High school seniors who are in current discussion with their parents about the Edoofa Program. I have also reached out to some A’level students and parents who have mentioned getting back to me and the fact that there are Mid Year Examinations going on. 

2. In the African School Education Reform Mission, I have managed to connect with the Guidance Counselor at Masiyephambili College, Mrs J Ncube. I informed her of the Edoofa Program, the EWYL and the benefits to students, parents and schools once they are partnered together. Fortunately she was aware of Edoofa but however then further mentioned that Masiye is associated with the Edoofa team. I plan to head to a number of schools in the coming week as I feel it will be easier once Mid Year Examinations have concluded. 

3. The Challenge I am facing in the Community Building Project is receiving feedback from most of the students that I have informed and shared with the Application Form. 

4. The challenges I’m facing in the African School Education Reform Mission are  that when I reach out to schools via email or WhatsApp, I almost never receive a response. Another may be self confidence in being able to head over to schools and pitch in person. I plan to overcome that and with your guidance and assistance, I know I will improve.
20/07/23, 16:39 - Jasmine Kaur: Rufaro, in order to get more results on the Community building. You need to reach out to more students.
20/07/23, 16:41 - Rufaro EWYL23E0287: I understand that very much ma’am
20/07/23, 16:43 - Jasmine Kaur: How many schools are near your place Rufaro?
20/07/23, 16:45 - Rufaro EWYL23E0287: There are 4 if I am not mistaken
20/07/23, 16:45 - Rufaro EWYL23E0287: Secondary Schools
20/07/23, 16:51 - Jasmine Kaur: So can you visit all 4 schools?
20/07/23, 16:53 - Rufaro EWYL23E0287: Yes I can, except for Masiyephambili College.
20/07/23, 16:54 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, So visit all these 3 schools. Then you can give me an update on Monday.
20/07/23, 16:56 - Rufaro EWYL23E0287: I believe I can do so.
20/07/23, 16:57 - Jasmine Kaur: Great, So, It’s time to conclude our session for today. This journey of yours is filled with immense potential, and I encourage you to give it your all. As we wrap up for today, I would like to remind you that our next session is scheduled for Monday at 12:00 pm.

Until then, take care, stay motivated, and strive for greatness. Have a wonderful day!

27/07/23, 12:20 - Rufaro EWYL23E0287: 1. The practice of journaling, even with a single sentence daily, contributes to my personal growth and self-awareness over time by allowing me gain clarity, process my feelings, and identify patterns in my behavior or thinking.


2. I believe journaling will help me identify and address sources of stress or triggers in my life by highlighting the challenges and obstacles that I face in my everyday journey. Notifying significant events, accomplishments and challenges will contribute in tracking my personal growth and in turn leading to improved emotional regulation and well-being. 

Hall of Inspiration 
Sipho Ndlovu is truly impressive with what she has done. I believe she possesses the qualities of a student leader as she is engaging in community service by volunteering to be part of the community that provides donors and doctors in Mzilikazi. Her message of spreading love and making a point that one’s love can impact greatly in someone’s life is truly inspirational. I commend her for all she has done.
02/08/23, 13:24 - Rufaro EWYL23E0287: Good morning Ms Jasmine, I hope you are well today. I am currently remaking the Saturday activity and will send it today. *I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN! *
