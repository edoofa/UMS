The sky's the limit for us as true Edoofians! üöÄ
13/12/23, 15:36 - Saloni Rastogi: 2) *Program Structure and Agenda*


Since your sessions are on Tuesday and Friday from 12:00-01:30 PM, this is how your week will roll on:

Monday to Sunday, that is all seven days, you have to follow the daily ritual. Here are specific guidelines for each day:


*Tuesday* - We will have our session from 12:00-01:30 PM where we will discuss your Saturday activity task, and then we will discuss how we can accelerate our performance on projects.

13/12/23, 16:40 - Saloni Rastogi: *Happy Wednesday*üåª

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into ‚Äì the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work ‚Äì a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.üåü

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.ü§ù

Best regards,
Team EWYL

Can you share your response to the Wednesday lesson that I shared with you yesterday?
14/12/23, 18:23 - Caabilo EWYL23E0144: Generally what I picked up is that  honesty and hard-work are imparative for success
14/12/23, 18:24 - Caabilo EWYL23E0144: U can not be successful while lying to yourself
And not putting in work also doesn't help

19/12/23, 15:45 - Saloni Rastogi: Good afternoon Caabilo,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
19/12/23, 15:49 - Caabilo EWYL23E0144: Afternoon we may begin
19/12/23, 15:59 - Saloni Rastogi: Since you did not follow the daily ritual on Saturday therefore you have not received the Saturday activity.
19/12/23, 15:59 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to is the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù
19/12/23, 15:59 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
19/12/23, 16:00 - Caabilo EWYL23E0144: I apologise for that I didn't have internet bundle
19/12/23, 16:01 - Caabilo EWYL23E0144: Following
19/12/23, 16:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Okay, no worries.

May I know the last update that we discussed on projects in our last session?
19/12/23, 16:11 - Caabilo EWYL23E0144: Yes so most of my peers are relactant to apply as they want to wait for their results
19/12/23, 16:12 - Saloni Rastogi: Then, is this is the case then can we move to the school project?
19/12/23, 16:16 - Caabilo EWYL23E0144: Yes am working on that one as well am still trying to get hold of proper school authorities
19/12/23, 16:26 - Saloni Rastogi: There are two ways to work on the African School Reform project:
19/12/23, 16:26 - Saloni Rastogi: A. *Connecting with school virtually*-
‚ñ™Ô∏è In this you would have to find the contacts of the schools through your peers, friends, neighbors, cousins, school teachers, and school heads.
‚ñ™Ô∏èThen introduce yourself to them professionally and state the purpose of connecting with them along with their available time.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share information about Edoofa that I will be providing you in order to help them understand the Program deeply and with more clarity.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share the school form with them, and if they are interested in connecting with us, then our aim should be to get the form filled.
19/12/23, 16:26 - Saloni Rastogi: B. *Visiting schools physically*

‚ñ™Ô∏è Now by this, as it clearly says, you have to visit schools nearby and inform them about Edoofa.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Visiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏è With this, you will surely gain a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, overcome the fear of presenting yourself and your family Edoofa, spontaneously in front of anyone at any point.
19/12/23, 16:29 - Caabilo EWYL23E0144: Am trying this one as schools are closed
19/12/23, 16:44 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know how many contacts you have so far?
19/12/23, 16:46 - Caabilo EWYL23E0144: So far I was promised my  old school's deputy Head's number
19/12/23, 16:55 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know if you have connected with them virtually?
19/12/23, 17:03 - Caabilo EWYL23E0144: They haven't responded I suspect it's ZIMSEC marking
19/12/23, 19:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Okay, I understand that.
19/12/23, 19:53 - Saloni Rastogi: üé∂ Also, welcome to the festive spirit of Christmas week, Caabilo!

Did you know that Santa's reindeer are not just fast fliers; they also have some fun names? Can you name all eight of them?
There's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen. And of course, the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph, with his shiny red nose! ü¶åüéÖ‚ú®

Your Mentor,
Ms. Saloni
19/12/23, 19:53 - Caabilo EWYL23E0144: But I will countinue pushing
19/12/23, 19:53 - Caabilo EWYL23E0144: Thank you have a wonderful festive season
20/12/23, 16:28 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy Wednesday‚ú®
üöÄ Brace yourself for a lesson sprinkled with knowledge and a dash of holiday cheer! üéÑüéÅ

Today's Wednesday Wisdom is not just special but carries a powerful reminder of the true essence of Christmas. As we stand on the brink of the festive season, it's crucial to reflect on the values that unite us as a community.

Beyond the glittering lights and festive decorations, Christmas serves as a poignant reminder of the core values that bind humanity together. It's a time when love, compassion, and generosity take center stage, fostering a sense of togetherness and shared joy.

Let's take a moment today to embrace the spirit of Christmas, appreciating the significance of our connections with one another. The lessons learned during this festive season go beyond the celebration itself, leaving a lasting impact on the way we interact with those around us.

May this Wednesday Wisdom inspire you to carry the spirit of Christmas not just during the holiday season but throughout the year! üéÑ‚ú®

Wishing you a joyous and reflective Wednesday!

Warm regards,
Team EWYL
