I am a proud Edoofian?
15/07/22, 21:47 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

28/07/22, 01:05 - Nyama EWYL21E0193: We are the Agents of our lives. The choices that we make pave our own path which determines whether or not we have a successful future 

Successful individuals are focused and hardworking, this means putting extra hours into an upcoming business, ideas and projects. These personnel are critical thinkers who come up with unique ideas that benefit the society resulting in a high demand of their services. In that process it makes them money thus them becoming tomorrow's entrepreneurs. Spending money is not their Forte. They are focused on saving and investing.  Investments make them a profit. The road to success may mean experiencing failure a number of times but taking responsibility, bring about growth in the sense that you will want to fix the error and trying again in a new and improved way. Having said this it does not mean that one should pursue constantly dumb ideas. Successful people are not always the most intelligent but they are able to discern profitable and non-profitable business ideas. 

To develop the same mindset as that of successful people I need to live according to their standard especially financially. I have personally identified that focus is the initiative. Being successful is a process that happens line upon line and precept upon precept.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off
