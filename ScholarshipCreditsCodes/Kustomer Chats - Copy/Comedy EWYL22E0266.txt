16/07/22, 00:35 - Comedy EWYL22E0266: Good afternoon Ms Riva, it's comedy
16/07/22, 17:36 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"


Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these at
16/07/22, 17:42 - Comedy EWYL22E0266: Thanks very much for the wise words
16/07/22, 20:51 - Unknown: Today I wanted to discuss the recent message I shared with you. The message that we want to be our daily habit, our words of connecting and experiencing a sense of belonging, We all at team Edoofa are very thrilled as we personally are undertaking the same activity. May I know what have you understood from this message, what is the intention behind the same?
16/07/22, 21:10 - Comedy EWYL22E0266: I understood that we as edoofa and the community we must have a link that gives passion and love for our advancement, so that we all grow together! We can achieve this by working together and sharing positive thoughts and ideas with one another! I also understand very well that an edoofian is a strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader of tomorrow, using their skills and knowledge to bring change to their community, country and the world! Thanks very much for the wise advice!
16/07/22, 21:24 - Unknown: You know what will happen when you every morning are saying that you are a proud Edoofian, you are sending a message to the universe that you believe in who you are, you are dedicated to this student community, you are part of the ambitious Edoofians. With help of the above text, can you define who an Edoofian is?
16/07/22, 21:39 - Comedy EWYL22E0266: An Edoofian is an strong and highly aspired somebody, who is dedicated to be the future leader, coming with strong changes and developments to the world, using their expertise!

18/07/22, 19:56 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian,

18/07/22, 21:58 - Unknown: That is great so daily texting me in the morning saying- I am a proud Edoofian should charge you up and fill you with Pride. Let us make it our daily ritual!
18/07/22, 22:25 - Unknown: Comedy , also I wanted to talk to you about something.
18/07/22, 22:26 - Unknown: 1) School Name: Masiyephambili High
2) Name of Contact Person: Ms J Ncube.

3) Designation of the Contact Person: Carrier Counsellor

4) Whatsapp Number: +263773436613

5) I got to know about the School because it's just nearby where I stay, and several of my colleagues did their high school there. Firstly I explained to the contact person my high school experience, how I applied and got enrolled into the Edoofa scholarship Program, including the paying of enrollment fees, registration fees, semester fees, air ticket and yellow fever vaccination! The contact person got interested about Edoofa, especially on the part of affordability of education under edoofa as well as employability of the students! She then introduced me to a group of U6 students to whom I explained genuinely about Edoofa and are now ready to be part of us, soon after they finish writing to their A level Examinations!

Year of establishment of the School: 1998
Number of Students in A level: 60
Fees structure in A level: RTGS 280000 \/ $1400USD.
Pass% of A Level: 92%
Number of Teachers in school: 30
18/07/22, 22:27 - Unknown: Our team contacted this school, but the number given is that of a teacher. I need the number of deputy \/ headmaster in order to make it a success.
18/07/22, 22:28 - Unknown: Also, if you could just clarify the fees $1400 USD is the term fees or the yearly fees?
18/07/22, 23:25 - Comedy EWYL22E0266: Term per fees
18/07/22, 23:25 - Comedy EWYL22E0266: Okay
18/07/22, 23:26 - Comedy EWYL22E0266: The deputy head is the one who referred me to her!(teacher)
18/07/22, 23:30 - Unknown: Okay great Comedy,
The school got converted.
18/07/22, 23:31 - Unknown: Thanks for your consistent efforts.

19/07/22, 00:30 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
