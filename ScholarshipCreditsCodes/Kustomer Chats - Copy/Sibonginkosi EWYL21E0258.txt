13/07/22, 00:25 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

15/07/22, 03:14 - Sibonginkosi EWYL21E0258: Alright Ms Saloni 

Will do em tonight before l.sleep
19/07/22, 07:27 - Sibonginkosi EWYL21E0258: Hello my *proud Edoofians*!
Hope you are doing well. 
You must have learned how critical it is to take advantage of every opportunity. In our _Wednesday Wisdom_ this week, we discussed a profitable business- *Skooqs*. Do you know that Skooqs was developed in just five days!! Thanks to Oluwadamilola Soyombo's (Founder of Skooqs), diligence and use of the opportunity. The use of the opportunity at the right time with the right skills is currently creating a significant impact on the African entrepreneurial ecosystem.  And well some of you, because of your consistency, diligence, willingness to show up for your sessions, and performance in your weekly activities have gotten this opportunity to work on a project with Skooqs. 

You are probably aware of the possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. This week, I want you to think of a few skills or practices that a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits. 
Please list the skills that are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring in a lot of learning.

You are required to share your response in *150 to 200* words over *the dedicated EWYL line* in your first session in *the next week*.

19/07/22, 07:42 - Sibonginkosi EWYL21E0258: I think the skills for one to get projects that are challenging and that will bring in a lot learning are : 

Keeping a positive attitude...one has to be always positive, work on whatever projects or task that they are tasked to do 

One has to show drive \/ initiative...showing people that you want to do something, that you are willing to do that particular something  

One has to work for themselves....show persistence

Confidence...one has to believe themselves that there are strong and able to take any challenge thrown at them 

One has to have skills ....skills make one standout in a lot of people .
19/07/22, 07:44 - Sibonginkosi EWYL21E0258: Good morning Ms Saloni 
I'd like to apologize for not reporting for my sessions lately ,have been going through a lot 
But from today onwards l will try by all means to report for my sessions even if am late
19/07/22, 21:33 - Unknown: Greetings Sibonginkosi!
How's your day going?
19/07/22, 21:34 - Unknown: I am really glad to hear your understanding of the activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. 
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY* . They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.
19/07/22, 21:35 - Unknown: Sibonginkosi I hope you are well now and we can actively resume with our sessions.
19/07/22, 21:36 - Unknown: Since you have so brilliantly penned down your responses, I would like to share with you last week's weekend activity so that we can also discuss on the same.
19/07/22, 21:37 - Unknown: WEEKEND ACTIVITY
It's that time of the week when you are required to wear your thinking caps and get your tools ready to research and learn!

20/07/22, 23:27 - Sibonginkosi EWYL21E0258: Fast growing industry \/ sector\/ business industries in Zimbabwe ..

The Agricultural industry is the fast growing industry in Zimbabwe, as the countries economy is mostly based on Agriculture .

Strengths of the business 
_Traceability 
_safe products 
-posetive environmental contributions 
_ large market that already exists 
_ consumer information already exists 

Weaknesses 
-Competition 
-Unpredictable production..as a farmer you never know the outcome until you see it 
-high cost of market 
-lack of information on Zim farmers
- lack of knowledge about the industry, as most people in Zimbabwe are doing agriculture for survival 

Opportunities 
- local market 
- multi species production eg fish farming, mushroom farming etc
-there is potential to high demand 
- enlargement of product variety 

Future performance of the industry 

The agriculture industry is expected to excel since they will be sophisticated technology such as temperature and moisture sensors, these will allow farms to be more profitable, safe and environmentally friendly.
20/07/22, 23:27 - Sibonginkosi EWYL21E0258: I hope l dd the right thing
20/07/22, 23:27 - Sibonginkosi EWYL21E0258: I am a proud Edoofian
20/07/22, 23:28 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

21/07/22, 21:13 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Sibonginkosi!
How's your day going?
21/07/22, 21:14 - Unknown: I read your response Sibonginkosiand it made me so inquisitive to know more about agriculture in Zimbabwe look what I found  is overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture. Agriculture accounts for 18% of Zimbabwe's GDP as of 2015. Agriculture enabled people to produce surplus food. There are different crops that farmers grow and some of these include, maize, sorghum, rapoko, groundnuts, round-nuts, and beans.''
Your response reflects clarity in the way you have expressed and so thoughtfully you have penned down your thoughts.
21/07/22, 21:15 - Unknown: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.
21/07/22, 21:16 - Unknown: Along with the successful completion of your weekend activity, let's move further.

Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our *WEDNESDAY Wisdom* was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
21/07/22, 21:17 - Sibonginkosi EWYL21E0258: I am a proud Edoofian

Please share your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom.
I am very excited to discuss this with you.
25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

28/07/22, 22:54 - Unknown: Greetings Sibonginkosi!
How's your day going?
28/07/22, 22:58 - Unknown: I totally understand that Sibonginkosi, you must be so occupied in your preparation because you will be leaving your Homeland for such a long duration, and of course, you have to make sure that you are fully prepared and loaded with all the necessities. Take your time Sibonginkosi, and you always know that I am not just your mentor imparting you with knowledge and skills on a daily basis but my role is also to understand you as a friend and provide you with solutions to all your concerns and queries. 
I can understand that submitting a response at times can be difficult but I want us to stay connected every day. So I feel the best solution to it is that every day you come to the EWYL Line and follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud EDOOFIAN'. In this way, we will stay connected each day and I will be able to have quick updates on your preparation and progress. What do you think?
