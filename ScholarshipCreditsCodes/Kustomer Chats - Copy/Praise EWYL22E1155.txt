30/09/23, 13:24 - Praise EWYL22E1155: Mastering time management

Importances of time management:

1. Maximises productivity - you accomplish more in less time and have time to relax 
2. Reduces stress- helps avoid procrastination and pressure while the time is already lost
3. Achieve goals - you cab set goals and focus on what truly matters.

Managing time during exams :

1.Creation of a study schedule for example use of Pomodoro techinique - you can  set a timer of  25minutes and focus on a task and when timer is off you take a 5 minutes break and carry on to other tasks.This helps focus and accomplish set goals
2. Set clear goals - establish clear and achievable goals for each study
3. Prioritise tasks - use of Eisenhower matrix to focus on what truly matters  (urgent vs important)
4. Avoid procrastination - use of Pomodoro technique to avoid time management pitfall.
5. Stay organised- create a clean study space , eliminate distractions like turning off your phone and work on a quiet space.
6. Practise selfcare - good diets and well being
30/09/23, 13:26 - Praise EWYL22E1155: awesome
30/09/23, 15:24 - Saloni Rastogi: Dear Students,

As we approach the upcoming exam period, it is crucial to ensure that you are well-prepared not only academically but also in terms of time management and maintaining effective communication with your mentors. To facilitate this process, we kindly request all students to submit their time management strategies and plans for maintaining constant communication with mentors during the exam period.
Your submitted strategies will not only help you stay on track during the exam period but also enable your mentors to provide you with the support and guidance you need.
We appreciate your proactive approach to effective time management and mentor communication during this crucial time. Your success is our priority, and we are here to support you every step of the way.

Best regards,
TEAM EWYL
30/09/23, 15:28 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session could not be held yesterday since I had to visit one of our partner universities to meet our students. But yes, I am really happy to see the response.
30/09/23, 15:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Impressive insights on time management, dear student! Your understanding of its importance and practical strategies for effective time utilization is commendable.
Here's a fascinating tidbit: Did you know that the "Pomodoro Technique" you mentioned was named after the Italian word for tomato? The creator, Francesco Cirillo, used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer when he first developed this method in the late 1980s. üçÖ It's a testament to how a simple idea can grow into a widely-used productivity tool!
Keep up the excellent work in mastering time management; it's a skill that will serve you well in academics and beyond. üåüüìö‚è≥

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning

07/10/23, 17:14 - Saloni Rastogi: I noticed that you weren't able to fully focus during our session yesterday, and I understand that you're facing challenges. I remember suggesting that you share your responses before our sessions, but I've been thinking about how sustainable this approach is and how productive it's been. Considering the long-term goals of our mentorship, I truly appreciate your commitment to the program, but I believe we might get better results if we pause it until after your exams. This way, you can fully dedicate yourself to the program when you have more time and energy.

How was your weekend?

As part of this week's Activity, we wanted you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relationship, you have opted for a path toward success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately develop a stronger network for yourself?

In our session on the EWYL Line, we will talk about:
‚ñ™Ô∏èYour views on the activity
‚ñ™Ô∏èProject plan
02/03/23, 23:45 - Praise EWYL22E1155: Maam my username is Praise Anisha Morylene Choto for both instagram and facebook accounts
03/03/23, 02:02 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Praise!
How are you?
These are amazing pictures that you have shared with me.
03/03/23, 02:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, may I know on which project you will be focusing on in the month of March?
03/03/23, 04:27 - Praise EWYL22E1155: Thank you Maam
03/03/23, 04:27 - Praise EWYL22E1155: I will be focussing on project one Ms Saloni
03/03/23, 21:28 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Praise!
How are you?
03/03/23, 21:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' for today.
03/03/23, 21:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù
03/03/23, 21:29 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
03/03/23, 21:30 - Saloni Rastogi: For the corporate alliances' project, let me share audio that will FIRST, help you in understanding the IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROJECT
03/03/23, 21:30 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, can I have your Wednesday lesson response?
03/03/23, 21:38 - Praise EWYL22E1155: Greetings Maam
03/03/23, 21:39 - Praise EWYL22E1155: Sorry Maam i forgot
03/03/23, 21:39 - Praise EWYL22E1155: Okay
03/03/23, 21:54 - Praise EWYL22E1155: I learned a lot from the story of Netflorist .
I learned that it is important to think outside the box.I realised this when the Bacher brothers switched their business to be an online platform for shopping .That was amaizing.This taught me that in my life for example i will go through many in these experiences of life and want to figure out some other ways to reach to success i have to think widely not limited.
I also learned the importance of good communication skills.This is one of the skills used by the Bacher brothers when they would reachout to new customers and brand awareness.This will help me one when i will become a lawyer when i will be communicating with people the communication skills will help me.Also Maam i might use them in my daily life .
03/03/23, 21:55 - Praise EWYL22E1155: Sorry Maam i thought the session of today was starting half two
03/03/23, 21:56 - Praise EWYL22E1155: Noted Maam ...I am really sorry for today
03/03/23, 21:57 - Praise EWYL22E1155: Okay Maam i understand .This will never repeat itself again
03/03/23, 21:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Our session is today Praise, it is just that I have a lot of students to be addressed in the same slot of time so there can be certain delays in reverting to you.
03/03/23, 21:57 - Saloni Rastogi: I completely agree with you on Wednesday lesson and I believe experiences make us feel alive: there are times when we live our lives and slowly let them pass us by. This can happen when you stick to the same routine day and night without doing anything new. Going through life in the same 'state' can be tedious, but an unforgettable experience will awaken your mind and soul.
 Innovation is the reflection of change and solution in respect of some problems in Life. Innovations by any means are basically the solutions to our daily life problems
03/03/23, 21:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Also did you listen to the audio?
03/03/23, 21:58 - Praise EWYL22E1155: Okay Maam i wasnt aware

Some students achieved it, and some are still working. I want that you take a moment to realize that only if you *work on the project--->*then only you will earn credits--->then only you will be able to financially assist yourself and your family while paying your college fees*.

10/03/23, 20:38 - Saloni Rastogi: The students who did not follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian on the EWYL Line', did not receive the Wednesday lesson this time.

10/03/23, 21:54 - Praise EWYL22E1155: North Star Metric 
From my understanding it is the most important goal of a business ,it is the key business metric that reflects onto the core value that a company delivers to its customers. The NSM has to be measurable , relevant and aligned with the company's overall success while serving as a guidepost for decision making and prioritization .For the  business, the  NSM helps it to focus on what really matters .Having a clear understanding of the most important
metric also helps a student . A student has to have a metric ,  it could be the Learning Mastery. It's a metric that represents the students ability to demonstrate mastery of the subject matter they are studying. Students can align their goals and prioritize to achieve the academic success. This can be done by consistently studying and seeking feedback from leaders and peers. Students can also  identify areas that they are having challenges and develop strategies to improve their understanding.


This is really amazing Ma'am. I am student but I do not have a clear NSM for myself. This is a wonderful Wenesday wisdom topic Ms Saloni
10/03/23, 22:20 - Saloni Rastogi: When setting direction to success you must make good choices on the path you are going to choose. 
Setting goals is the most important thing you can do in your life.
For us, the North Star Metric is achieving the target of 5 companies at least a week and earning about $50 in a month.
10/03/23, 22:21 - Saloni Rastogi: What do you think?
10/03/23, 22:21 - Praise EWYL22E1155: That is awesome Ma'am Saloni
10/03/23, 22:44 - Saloni Rastogi: We last discussed how to create a LinkedIn profile, now let's talk about the type of companies to reach out.
10/03/23, 22:44 - Praise EWYL22E1155: Okay Ma'am I'm listening
10/03/23, 22:45 - Saloni Rastogi: I have shared an audio and guide with you, once you go through it summarize with me what all you have understood.
10/03/23, 22:46 - Praise EWYL22E1155: Okay Ma'am I will
10/03/23, 23:27 - Praise EWYL22E1155: From the document

I have to reach out to companies that are not large scale companies meaning they must have 200 people and less not more than 200.Also the companies must be student centric or recreational. They must be companies that are helpful and useful to Edoofa like beverages and food companies.Also the companies must be financially sound .The companies must have association with African countries and India also if they are located in India they must have African countries. Also the founder of the company must have a strong background.
11/03/23, 00:29 - Saloni Rastogi: That's great!
Now our main aim is to get the form filled.
11/03/23, 00:30 - Saloni Rastogi: Listen to this and we will discuss about it tomorrow.
11/03/23, 00:31 - Praise EWYL22E1155: Okay Ms Saloni

The feedback we have received from some of you on this week‚Äôs Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.
As part of this week‚Äôs Saturday Activity, you are required to share your written submission on : 
What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?
There is no word limit, so feel free to express your understanding in detail. The second answer requires some mental work, so sit with yourself, introspect, and share your honest answer with your mentor. 
Let this activity play an important role in your personal goal setting. We will connect soon in our upcoming session. 
Till then, happy learning and happy growing!
11/03/23, 23:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me share with you the star performers for this week, I applaud them for their amazing performance in the following projects:

13/03/23, 20:49 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he‚Äôd received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he‚Äôd paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

‚ÄúYour honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,‚Äù he replied.

‚ÄúHow do you weight the butter then?‚Äù Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

‚ÄúYour honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I‚Äôve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it‚Äôs the baker.‚Äù

In business, the North Star represents a company's unwavering definition of its purpose, its products, its customers and potential acquirers. Clarity about a company's North Star leads founders and companies toward their goals and helps investors envision the company's future growth.

As a student my North Star Metric is being dedicated, study hard and being allergic with average
