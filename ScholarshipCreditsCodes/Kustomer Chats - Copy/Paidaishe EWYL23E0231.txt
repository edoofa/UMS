10/07/23, 00:41 - Paidaishe EWYL23E0231: My inspirational story is about Steve Jobs who is the Co-founder of Apple company

By the age of 25, his net worth became around  $100 million. He was fired from the company he co-founded by the Board as they felt like he was too young and difficult to work with. Steve jobs was so humiliated but he never gave up 

He founded another company  called NeXT and worked hard to lift it up to the top

Realizing the value of what Jobs was doing at NeXT ,Apple wanted him back and named him the interim CEO and eventually acquired the coveted CEO title that he had gotten fired for aiming at 12 years prior

This story of Jobs teachs me to never give up on my dreams and goal nomatter the obstacles l came across. I should stay strong for my time will come
