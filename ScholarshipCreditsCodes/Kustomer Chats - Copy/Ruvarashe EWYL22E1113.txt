This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!üéâ
20/04/23, 17:28 - Aditi Kapoor: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

24/04/23, 20:36 - Ruvarashe EWYL22E1113: I'm a proud Edoofian
24/04/23, 20:36 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian, ready for a motivational monday?

In a remote village, there lives a hardworking farmer who owns a farm. Over the years his grapery yields rich crops, and the farmer is very successful. He has three sons, who are young and energetic but never worry about working. As the farmer grows older, he begins to worry about his sons‚Äô future.

Then he becomes very ill and feels that his death is coming soon. He calls his sons and says,

‚ÄúDear sons, I see my death approaching, but I want to share a secret before you all leave. These areas have treasure hidden inside. Dig the whole area after my death, to find it. ‚Äù

The old farmer died. The sons start digging for money without leaving any part of the field but nothing is found. In any case, digging their fields leads to healthier crops and results in higher incomes. These earnings make the sons realize what their father means.

What according to you is the moral of the story?

a. Hard work always pays off. The fruits of hard work are always sweet.
b. Be Selflessly kind
c. both a & b
24/04/23, 20:38 - Ruvarashe EWYL22E1113: A
26/04/23, 00:36 - Ruvarashe EWYL22E1113: Im a proud Edoofian.

A. Zambezi
B. Nile
C. Niger

26/04/23, 16:50 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Rumbidzai!
How are you?
26/04/23, 16:52 - Aditi Kapoor: So, now that you formed the group and I shared some valuable resources with you as well.

26/04/23, 22:01 - Ruvarashe EWYL22E1113: So far it is a little bumpy because of lack of cooperation from the group members but I'm trying to gather more people.
26/04/23, 22:02 - Ruvarashe EWYL22E1113: Sorry but it is Ruvarashe.

02/05/23, 12:03 - Aditi Kapoor: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.

Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell:

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges.
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
 3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above

-just ask the students/participants to DM you to know about Edoofa and to get the form
-once they DM you, share about Edoofa with them
-Before sharing the form, ask them to get you added to their school groups
