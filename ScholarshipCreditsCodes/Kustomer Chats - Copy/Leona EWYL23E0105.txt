20/06/23, 15:48 - Leona EWYL23E0105: I am ready!
20/06/23, 15:50 - Jasmine Kaur: Now, let us begin our session. I trust that you have completed your Saturday Activity, and I am eager to review it. Please share your Saturday Activity with me, as we delve into a productive discussion.
20/06/23, 16:09 - Leona EWYL23E0105: This is the activity right?
20/06/23, 16:11 - Leona EWYL23E0105: *Saturday Activity:* 

Harnessing the power of incremental improvements and connections between existing ideas can be an exciting way to drive creative progress and innovation. 

1. The key to leveraging incremental improvements and connections between existing ideas lies in embracing a growth mindset. It's important to believe that even small improvements can make a significant impact over time. By continuously seeking feedback, experimenting, and learning from failures, we can refine our ideas and make progress.

To foster connections between existing ideas, I would actively engage with diverse sources of inspiration. I would explore various fields, read books, listen to podcasts, and connect with people from different backgrounds. By doing so, I can discover hidden connections and adapt concepts from one area to another, leading to fresh perspectives and innovative solutions.

Collaboration is also vital. By collaborating with others who have different expertise and viewpoints, I can tap into their knowledge and experience, opening up new possibilities. Sharing ideas and working together can lead to unexpected breakthroughs and accelerate the creative process.

2. Significant advancements in different fields have often been achieved by building upon existing ideas and making iterative improvements rather than starting from scratch. Here are some examples:

In technology, look at smartphones. Each new model builds upon the previous version by incorporating user feedback, refining design, and introducing new features. This iterative approach has revolutionized communication and transformed how we live.

In medicine, vaccines are an excellent example. Scientists have built upon decades of research on the immune system and previous vaccine development to create highly effective vaccines. The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, for instance, are based on prior knowledge of mRNA technology and its potential.

Transportation is another field where iterative improvements have been impactful. From the earliest automobiles to electric vehicles, advancements have been made by refining engine efficiency, safety features, and incorporating new technologies. Electric vehicles, in particular, have evolved from existing knowledge of internal combustion engines and battery technology.

Even in art and design, artists and designers continuously build upon existing styles and techniques. They take inspiration from past works, adding their unique flair and pushing the boundaries of creativity. Art movements like Impressionism and Cubism emerged by combining existing artistic traditions with innovative approaches.

Overall,  I believe that by embracing a growth mindset, seeking diverse inspiration, collaborating with others, and learning from incremental improvements, we can contribute to driving creative progress and innovation in various fields.
20/06/23, 16:15 - Jasmine Kaur: While I review your Saturday Activity, I would like you to take this opportunity to share your progress on the project and set achievable targets for this week. It is important to establish realistic goals that you can confidently work towards and ultimately achieve.
20/06/23, 16:16 - Jasmine Kaur: This is the newsletter, Leona. I am so happy that you have gone through it.
20/06/23, 16:16 - Jasmine Kaur: I am talking about the activity based on entrepreneurs.
20/06/23, 16:17 - Leona EWYL23E0105: I don't think I received it Miss Jasmine.
20/06/23, 16:23 - Leona EWYL23E0105: This week I'll be reaching out to prospective students and I am too find at least 5 students that I can introduce to a Edoofa and I'll also be a request to my former school's headmaster.
20/06/23, 16:28 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, that looks perfect for the week Leona. 
Now let me share the Saturday Activity with you. Make sure that you complete the activity by today. 


Wishing you a thought-provoking and fulfilling Saturday activity! Enjoy the process of discovering more about yourself and the entrepreneurs who have left a lasting impact on the world.
20/06/23, 16:28 - Jasmine Kaur: ðŸ“¢ Hello, students! It's time for our exciting Saturday activity! ðŸŽ‰ This week, we dived into the captivating world of entrepreneurship, exploring the remarkable stories of four inspirational entrepreneurs. I'm confident that you have thoroughly researched and read about each of them in detail.

Now, I invite you to reflect on the entrepreneurs we discussed and share your favorite among them. In 200 words, I encourage you to highlight two similarities and two dissimilarities between yourself and your chosen entrepreneur.

As you analyze these similarities and differences, consider various aspects such as their journey, mindset, values, and achievements. Remember, this activity is an opportunity for self-reflection and to identify areas where you can draw inspiration or learn from these exceptional individuals.

By examining the similarities, you may discover shared traits, passions, or aspirations, creating a sense of connection and motivation. Exploring the differences can help you recognize unique qualities and perspectives, encouraging you to embrace your own individuality and strengths.

So, take your time, think deeply, and express your thoughts in a well-crafted 200-word response. Feel free to share your insights, and let the inspiration from these entrepreneurs propel you towards your own entrepreneurial dreams.
20/06/23, 19:46 - Leona EWYL23E0105: Tatenda Ndambakuwa, a Zimbabwean entrepreneur, serves as an exceptional role model in using technology to address pressing societal challenges. Through her venture, Shiri, she endeavors to empower farmers and combat food security issues within our country.

As a fellow Zimbabwean, I find a deep connection with Tatenda's mission and drive to leverage technology for social impact. Our shared roots and experiences in Zimbabwe instill a common passion for making a positive difference in our communities. We both recognize the challenges faced by farmers in Zimbabwe and the urgency to uplift agricultural practices to enhance food security.

Tatenda's accomplishments inspire me and reinforce the belief that as a young Zimbabwean, I too can contribute to the betterment of our society through technological innovation and entrepreneurship. While Tatenda has already established Shiri and is actively making strides in the agricultural sector, I am at the beginning of my own entrepreneurial journey.

However, her story serves as a beacon of inspiration, motivating me to persevere and make a meaningful impact within my beloved country, Zimbabwe. Through my pursuit of a degree in Computer Science and passion for utilizing technology, I aspire to follow in Tatenda's footsteps and contribute to addressing the pressing challenges faced by our nation.

Okay Leona
We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!
