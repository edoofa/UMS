09/08/22, 22:52 - Aditi Kapoor: Now we will be discussing something extremely essential for both of us as a team,
I will educate you about some brilliant stuff,
09/08/22, 23:29 - HALIMAR EWYL22E0136: Hello Edoofians,\r
I hope you had an amazing week.\r
I'm Angad Singh, the founder of the Edoofa Scholarship programme, and it's an honour to be playing a role\r
in shaping your careers. Today I was reminded of a quote \"Everyone tells a story about themselves inside\r
their own head. Always, all the time. That story makes you who you are. We build ourselves out of that\r
story. \" So make sure you tell yourself a positive story everyday!\r
Here are a few of my thoughts, freshly brewed for you.\r
3 QUOTES FOR YOU\r
1. “Everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness and growth occurs while\r
you're climbing it.” – Andy Rooney, journalist\r
2. “Once your mindset changes, everything on the outside will change along with it”. – Steve\r
Maraboli\r
3. “Life isn’t about waiting for the storm to pass. It’s about learning to dance with the rain. \"\r
-VivianGreen\r
2 QUESTIONS FOR YOU\r
The Feynman Technique is the best way to supercharge your learning. And it works no matter what the\r
subject. Devised by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, it leverages the power of teaching\r
for better learning.Learning doesn’t happen from skimming through a book or remembering enough to\r
pass a test.\r
Information is learned when you can explain it and use it in a wide variety of situations. The Feynman\r
Technique gets more mileage from the ideas you encounter instead of rendering anything new into isolated,\r
useless factoids.\r
When you really learn something, you give yourself a tool to use for the rest of your life. The more you\r
know, the fewer surprises you will encounter because most new things will connect to something you\r
already understand.
09/08/22, 23:29 - HALIMAR EWYL22E0136: Tts what I understand mam
10/08/22, 21:52 - HALIMAR EWYL22E0136: Good afternoon ma'am am a proud edofian
10/08/22, 21:55 - Aditi Kapoor: Wishing you a day full of sunny smiles and happy thoughts. Good morning!
10/08/22, 21:55 - Aditi Kapoor: Did you copy this from  your newsletter?
10/08/22, 21:57 - Aditi Kapoor: Today, if you go to New York, you will find hundreds of places where they learn chanting. People go for one hour in the evenings to chanting classes. They chant ‘Om Namah Shivaya’, which is originally an Indian Chant’. Of course, they have a different pronunciation .In China, they say, ‘Ladhe Ladhe’ .
10/08/22, 22:17 - HALIMAR EWYL22E0136: Morning mam
10/08/22, 22:18 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Edoofian,
Did you check my previous texts?
10/08/22, 22:43 - HALIMAR EWYL22E0136: They just go for visit or. Something
10/08/22, 22:43 - HALIMAR EWYL22E0136: Yes I did
10/08/22, 22:43 - HALIMAR EWYL22E0136: Yes I did
10/08/22, 23:57 - Aditi Kapoor: No edoofian, I am trying to explain the essence of chanting
10/08/22, 23:57 - Aditi Kapoor: Chanting brings us many medical, psychological and social benefits. In initial stages of chanting it may be difficult to recognise the benefits we derive from chanting. In later stages too, knowing the benefits of chanting can restore our faith after we have experienced them.


Now you tell me what is our CHANT that is to be sent each morning, all 7 days a week, including Sunday.. [In capital letters]

In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we discuss a crucial character quality that everyone should work on and make sure they have mastered the right attitude. Once you have read the full lesson, We will be having the discussion concerning the same in our next session. Write down if you have any questions or key observations from the lesson.

24/07/22, 16:38 - Jasmine Kaur: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

25/07/22, 03:15 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
