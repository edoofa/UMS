Greeting of the day my proud edoofian! How are you doing?
15/07/22, 00:34 - Unknown: Did you work on the Wednesday wisdom task I shared with you yesterday Simbarashe?

Personally I found it very interesting as it discussed the life and struggles of Patrice, an African Billionaire and I believe my students should take inspiration from him.
15/07/22, 04:55 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0560: Yes sir it was quite a learning curve someone loving something whilst doing his job for us we find difficulty in balance but he was patient seized the right opportunity got into mining and rose to success
15/07/22, 04:55 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0560: Not only that when everything was going down he had confidence which most of us lack we think we should always size obvious or certain opportunities but for him it was different he had to believe an outcome unpredictable he bought those mines and their point of decline and turned then into something else earning from them transforming them it was a complete turn around
15/07/22, 20:03 - Unknown: Amazing work on the Lesson task. I saw that Patrice had the wisdom to recognize and grab the opportunities that time brought for him and that is what set him apart from others and made him who he is.

Do you agree on this Simbarashe?

18/07/22, 16:45 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0560: *Mining*
This is a best prospect industry sector for this country l would say. Zimbabwes mining sector is highly diversified with close to 40 different minerals . The predominant minerals include platinum , chrome, gold, coal and diamonds. The country boasts the second largest platinum deposit and high grade chromium ores in the world with approximately 2.8billion tons of platinum group metals and 10 billion tons of chromium ores. The sector accounts for about 12 percent of the country's gross domestic product and the minister of mines claims the sector has the potential to generate us $12 billion annually by 2023 if the government addresses challenges such as persistent power shortages foreign currency shortages and policy uncertainties. For me the mining sector is really a fast growing sector in Zimbabwe considering also the exploration of possible oil and gas in Muzarabani scheduled to have started early this year. According to the African mining market Zimbabwe's lithium deposits are the largest in Africa and the country will become one of the world's largest lithium exporters due to the growing world demand for rechargeable batteries. According to my own understanding the strengths of our mining sector revolves around the availability of resources. The mining industry is one of those high paying sector or high generating income sectors.As Zimbabwe we have variety of these minerals which makes it a backbone or strength.Mineral exports account for about 60% of Zimbabwe's export earnings and the mining sector contributes around 16%national GDP. Basically the mining sector provides high paying jobs , supports regional economy and also high environmental standards. There is also room for development, expansion as well . Technology can also be improved through mining . As Zimbabwe we mine coal which cuts out power costs as a country. However mining has its own weakness that include extreme opposition by environmental groups. Also with time thee will be ex

18/07/22, 19:52 - Unknown: Did you also work on the SWOT analysis as asked by Ms Davi?
18/07/22, 20:12 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0560: Yes sir
18/07/22, 20:53 - Unknown: Please share that with me Simbarashe.
18/07/22, 20:55 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0560: I had merged them under the last part of the essay
18/07/22, 23:02 - Unknown: Yes Simbarashe, Let me first help you understand what SWOT Analysis is.

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment.This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organisations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
18/07/22, 23:03 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0560: Yes l understand sir it's almost similar to cost benefit analysis
18/07/22, 23:14 - Unknown: As seen above, SWOT is an acronym of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. However, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym:

1 Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
2 Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
3 Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
4 Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by
19/07/22, 18:07 - Unknown: Hello Simbarashe! How are you doing?
19/07/22, 18:16 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0560: I'm doing good sir
19/07/22, 19:53 - Unknown: glad to know that Simbarashe! I hope you enjoyed our yesterday's conversation. Now, What Are the Biggest SWOT Analysis Mistakes that people make?
19/07/22, 20:01 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0560: Some doesn't consider weaknesses but rather mainly focus on strengths and opportunities
19/07/22, 20:56 - Unknown: That is interesting Simbarashe.
19/07/22, 20:56 - Unknown: Here are the mistakes i believe people make:
1 Making your lists too long. Ask yourself if your ideas are feasible as you go along.
2 Being vague. Be specific to provide more focus for later discussions.
3. Not seeing weaknesses. Be sure to ask customers and colleagues what they experience in real life.
4. Not thinking ahead. It's easy to come up with nice ideas without taking them through to their logical conclusion. Always consider their practical impact.
5 Being unrealistic. Don't plan in detail for opportunities that don't exist yet.
19/07/22, 21:00 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0560: Noted sir
19/07/22, 21:44 - Unknown: So Simbarashe, now you know how to implement SWOT analysis, would you like to brief it?
19/07/22, 21:47 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0560: So basically swot analysis is about analysis all the aspects of a project or business, we have to closely look at it so that we can determine whether it's to the betterment or just exploitation. It is also used to consider whether a project should be done also can be used as a business forecast
19/07/22, 21:58 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0560: When we talk of swot we are looking into the strengths and opportunities along with the threats and weakness of a certain sector or business
19/07/22, 22:00 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0560: When we talk of swot we are looking into the strengths and opportunities along with the threats and weakness of a certain sector or business

21/07/22, 21:06 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0560: The main thing l picked out is that often we look for someone or something to blame for our problems and failures but it's not always the case as it weakens us but taking responsibility always makes us move forward and grow as well. And another thing success is worked for we work hard we go farther
21/07/22, 21:38 - Unknown: Good to read your response on this lesson Simbarashe! I am glad that you were able to understand the crux of that which is that successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it.
