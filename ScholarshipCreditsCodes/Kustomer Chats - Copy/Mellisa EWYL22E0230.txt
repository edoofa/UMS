No college ever teaches these, which is the primary factor that gives edge to Edoofians over other students.We have vert carefully selected the 3 core subjects which will certainly help you equip yourself to the current industry standards. The subjects are:
 
 1) Broad 21st-century skills  money management\/understanding value, communication, digital marketing
2) Industry knowledge kinds of industries are booming, sectoral and job opportunities, new developments in tech - what is crypto, blockchain, NFTs, cyberspace, digital media etc
3) African Entrepreneurs' stories or success stories of social development
14/07/22, 22:02 - Mellisa EWYL22E0230: This is definitely true. Most colleges do not teach these fundamental subjects.
14/07/22, 22:07 - Unknown: Okay so I am glad you get it now, also you are clear on *I am a proud edoofian* part right ?

15/07/22, 16:30 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
