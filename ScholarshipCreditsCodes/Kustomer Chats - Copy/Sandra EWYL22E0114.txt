It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Once it gets over, we will have our session,
09/08/22, 22:37 - Unknown: One can be called successful if they have achieved their desired goals. For some people, being successful means being rich. But being successful is even more than being rich. When you achieve what you want, it gives you immense pleasure, and that is incomparable with being rich. To be successful in any aspect of life, one needs to have strong dedication and work hard. 
Our WEEKEND ACTIVITY discussed the traits of a successful person.
So, in our session today, we will:
1. discuss your understanding of the weekend activity.
2. make weekly plans on achieving targets on three ongoing projects.
11/08/22, 00:53 - Unknown: Greetings Sandra!
Due to some medical emergency, I would not be able to take your session today.
But, nothing to worry about, I will do better after some time.
And by the time we have our next scheduled session, I want you to keep following the proud edoofian ritual.
Till then, have a great day.​
​And yes, we have our cultural festival tomorrow, named Raksha Bandhan. I want you to search for it, and if it gains your interest, we will surely discuss it in our next session.

11/10/22, 00:17 - Unknown: So, Barnabas, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully

11/10/22, 01:20 - Unknown: Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.
Responses will be accepted on the *EWYL Line* only.
_Till then keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'_.

22/07/22, 19:44 - Sandra EWYL22E0114: Greetings! Today I have gone to visit my doctor for the fitness exam so I may not be available for the session.
22/07/22, 23:43 - Sandra EWYL22E0114: I am now available
23/07/22, 00:10 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Sandra!
How's your day going?
23/07/22, 00:11 - Unknown: How did the fitness exam go?
23/07/22, 00:11 - Unknown: Along with this, let's move on with our session.
Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our WEDNESDAY Wisdom was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
23/07/22, 00:13 - Sandra EWYL22E0114: It went well Ms. Saloni, thanks for asking
23/07/22, 00:14 - Sandra EWYL22E0114: Yes
23/07/22, 00:30 - Sandra EWYL22E0114: What I understood from the Wednesday wisdom is that most of the time when things are not going well, people tend to look around to find something they can put the blame on. It is quite rare for people to inspect and accept their own flaws which then leads to failures. People should accept their mistakes and learn from them if they want to be better and successful
23/07/22, 00:45 - Sandra EWYL22E0114: And as for the projects, I have managed to get a few forms filled, but no connections have been successful with organisation founders yet
23/07/22, 02:10 - Unknown: I read your response Sandra and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
23/07/22, 02:10 - Unknown: Can you share the forms that you have got filled with me here?

24/07/22, 08:18 - Sandra EWYL22E0114: Saturday assignment

Successful people do not do something because someone did it and made it. They follow their passion and choose to do what they love. Doing this gives one extra encouragement to go and extra mile. It also gives one the confidence you can carry around when thinking or talking about your career, business and even studies.
Another interesting thing about successful people is that they accept and own up to their mistakes. They take full accountability and learn from them. This is an attitude most people lack as the first thing they do after failing is look for somewhere to put the blame on. We often forget to inspect and trace our own actions to see where we went wrong. Failure is just a stumbling block, not for you to fall on, but for you to use in building a platform and climb up the bigger obstacle. 
As a young individual with big dreams, I hope to be successful one day and to ensure this I have to keep a positive attitude. I have to do what I feel is right and is the best. Following a crowd is not an achievement anyway.
25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

26/07/22, 22:14 - Unknown: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

Yesterday I had an amazing day. I went to the airport to receive all my proud Edoofians and I had tears in my eyes seeing their happiness and enthusiasm. I want you to look at it and share your thoughts with me.
26/07/22, 22:17 - Unknown: I am so glad to receive the forms, I want the same response from your side under the community project on each day.
26/07/22, 22:19 - Unknown: I read your understanding of the weekend activity and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it’s not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you’re looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don’t do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.
27/07/22, 17:00 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Sandra!

Time management is defined as using your time productively and efficiently—but what about when you are working as productively as possible, and you still can’t get everything done? It may be better to think about time management as a combination of working productively and prioritizing your time.

Our *Wednesday Wisdom* was all about Time Management and understanding the priority matrix to organize our tasks. 
I am really excited to hear your understanding and working on the same.
Please share it with me here.
In today's session we will talk about:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. progress on community building projects.
29/07/22, 19:41 - Sandra EWYL22E0114: 7986407426 my Indian number ma'am
29/07/22, 19:49 - Sandra EWYL22E0114: Wednesday Wisdom was about time management. I learned that the way I manage my time depends on how I manage my priorities. There are urgent and important activities which may all need to be done, but with good time management skills I can get everything done at the appropriate time because I would have understood how to prioritise my activities. Some things may be urgent but not important and some important but not urgent while some are both. According to my understanding, it will be best to start off with urgent and important things
30/07/22, 03:14 - Unknown: Your response to the Wednesday wisdom has made me realize our childhood quote  is Money'.
Through Wednesday Wisdom, my main aim was to educate my Edoofians about TIME MANAGEMENT and HOW IT CAN BE ACHIEVED.
You know are very well aware of what Time management means, let me tell you about what Time Management includes:

#Effective Planning
# Setting goals and objectives
# Setting deadlines
# Delegation of responsibilities
# Prioritizing activities as per their importance
# Spending the right time on the right activity

The benefits of Time Management are:
- Time Management makes an individual punctual and disciplined.
- One becomes more organized as a result of effective Time Management.
- Individuals who stick to a time plan are the ones who realize their goals and objectives within the shortest possible period. 
- Research says that individuals who accomplish tasks on time are less prone to stress and anxiety. 

How can we achieve it:
# Set a goal for yourself.
# Priority matrix (like we talked about in the Wednesday lesson)
# Organize your study space
# Do a SWOT Analysis of yourself.

I am sure you will note all these things and imply in your day-to-day life and do share with me what changes you have felt.
30/07/22, 03:19 - Sandra EWYL22E0114: Yes of course I will be sure to apply these skills on an every day basis
30/07/22, 14:33 - Sandra EWYL22E0114: Greetings of the day.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
