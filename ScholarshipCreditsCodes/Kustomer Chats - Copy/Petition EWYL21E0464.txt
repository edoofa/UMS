19/07/22, 20:58 - Petition EWYL21E0464: An investment in knowledge pays the best interest. I am very grateful and honoured at the same time to be a proud Edoofian. My batch group name is Batch 3 and im here for my Earn While You Learn session.
19/07/22, 21:00 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

I hope that you are doing well

As August Intake is right at our doorsteps, So due to this many of our Edoofians will be arriving here in India to kick start their dream journey.?

I feel that it is my duty to make sure that the university has prepared well for their onboarding process.

This is why I would be visiting the universities Today in order to do a personal check up.
Since, This process would take up lots of time that is why we won't be able to connect Today.
However, I am sure that in my absence, You will make sure that you follow the below given things:

1. Make sure to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual at 9 AM Tomorrow.
2. Do submit the Wednesday Lesson before the deadline.
25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:07 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off
