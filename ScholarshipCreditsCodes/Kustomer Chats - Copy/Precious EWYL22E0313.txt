25/08/22, 23:55 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

03/10/22, 03:45 - Precious EWYL22E0313: These  pictures simply mean that in life there is no any easy way to achieve high goals but inoder to get that hardwork is needed.
Trying to achieve higher goals in an easy way is the longest way and most difficult thing to do.
Good planning leads to prosperity but hasty shortcuts lead to poverty.
