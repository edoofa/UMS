19/07/22, 17:11 - Emelda EWYL22E0399: Greetings  to you ma'am
19/07/22, 19:15 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"


Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these at

20/07/22, 18:03 - Jasmine Kaur: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

With help of the above text, can you define who an Edoofian is?

25/07/22, 03:18 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

Why does my hair ends become thinner as it grows longer?

One of the most consistent things in life is that we are creatures of habit, some of those include how we groom ourselves. inevitably, we also have a certain way we groom our hair. The algorithm we individually use, along with other known factors, when keeping our hair does affect hair thinning. Below are potential factors we will uncover. Let's dive in...

`Alopecia areata is distinguished by loss of hair on the scalp and other areas of the body. It is an autoimmune disease that results in hair loss. `

Telogen Effluvium- Though a reversible condition. Telogen Effluvium is a type of hair loss that is identified by hair thinning or an increase in hair shedding. This is caused by menopause, poor diet, and stress, including Pregnancy and childbirth amongst others.

Traction Alopecia-hair loss caused by tightly pulled hairstyles.

Androgenetic Alopecia - This is common in both men and women. Most women with androgenetic alopecia have diffuse thinning on all areas of the scalp. Men instead have more distinct patterns of baldness.Sesacare Rice Hair Oil with Methi and Hibiscus for long and short hair can be used to correct this problem. Sesacare Rice Hair Oil is a potent oil that contains Ayurvedic herbs that have been made for weak, brittle hair and hair prone to breakage. It is suitable for all hair types, it is 100% natural as it does not contain parabens, artificial color, silicones as well as fragrances.
