29/06/23, 13:41 - Shammah EWYL23E0212: Greetings Ms Saloni I am Shammah Nyatsanza. I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Shammah EWYL23E0212
29/06/23, 14:35 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Shammah!
How are you?
29/06/23, 14:36 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
29/06/23, 14:36 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
29/06/23, 14:36 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *12:00-01:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
29/06/23, 14:37 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
29/06/23, 17:39 - Shammah EWYL23E0212: Thanks Ms Saloni I will always strive for the daily 1 step daily
29/06/23, 17:41 - Shammah EWYL23E0212: Ok Ms Saloni  so I will be focusing with the community building project the month we are about to enter
29/06/23, 17:41 - Shammah EWYL23E0212: I'm very ready Ms Saloni
30/06/23, 16:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Shammah!
How are you?
30/06/23, 16:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' for today.
30/06/23, 16:05 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
30/06/23, 16:05 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
30/06/23, 21:06 - Shammah EWYL23E0212: I am a proud Edoofian
30/06/23, 21:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

01/07/23, 15:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!

How are you?
11/07/23, 15:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams.

11/07/23, 15:47 - Saloni Rastogi: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:

03/08/23, 13:03 - Shammah EWYL23E0212: I have read the Wednesday wisdom about adaptability which means being able to adapt to new environment, culture and places . Being able to adapt helps to reduce misunderstandings discrimination between people. To become adaptable one has to be open minded , to cultivate empathy so that you could be able to accommodate different people with different cultures . Adapting to social norms can also help one to be adaptable. Respecting each other is also important for adaptability whereby one values people with different cultures. Lastly handling culture shocks is also important, culture shocks are usually faced when one goes to a new environment but one must be able to handle them so that adaptability can be of use
03/08/23, 13:03 - Shammah EWYL23E0212: Good morning Ms Saloni
03/08/23, 13:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Good morning!
