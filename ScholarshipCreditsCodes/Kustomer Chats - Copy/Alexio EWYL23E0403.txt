19/08/23, 12:50 - Alexio EWYL23E0403: Ok that's noted
19/08/23, 15:30 - Alexio EWYL23E0403: 3-There is a life story of a man named Karen who lived in Nyajena area in Masvingo province. Karen grew up under the care of his grandparents from his childhood because his mother and father were involved in an accident when he was 2 years old. His grandparents were not able to pay for his academic fees because they were not employed and they did not have any which project which can sustain their grandson's education.
But this man was very intelligent, so there was a family in that area which decided to adopt Karen and be responsible for his education. Karen went to his primary education and he passed with flying colors and this impressed his new family and they continue to sponsor his education until he finished his secondary level.

Karen got 15 points at his advanced level and he was given a scholarship to Russia, so he went there and do civil engineering for four years there. Luckily, after finishing his degree he was employed there in Russia and he became one of the most successful people in Nyajena area. But he didn't forget the family that adopt him and he built them a mansion in their area of Nyajena and they were so filled with joy. He never stopped doing good things to them because he feels like they are gold to him because they made him to achieve something that's great in life which is EDUCATION. And he continued to show gratitude to that family and even sponsoring children who are not having education due to lack of financial support.
