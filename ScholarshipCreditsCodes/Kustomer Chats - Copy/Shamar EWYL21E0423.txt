a)Target- no. of credits you want to earn in the month of October

10/10/22, 21:25 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

13/10/22, 21:10 - Unknown: I noticed that you have not submitted the Saturday’s Activity yet. The deadline for that was Tuesday 6 PM but I gave you a leeway. Due to the delay, You also missed out on the Wednesday lesson that I was not able to share with you due to the pending last two submissions.

Today, At all costs, I would need the submission for the Last week's Saturday Activity.
I am sharing it below.

After that, I am sharing this week's Wednesday Lesson which you have to submit on Friday by 6 PM.

We can not allow ourselves to at a such mediocre pace.
If somehow, You have not received it, I am sharing it below again.
13/10/22, 21:10 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.

20/10/22, 18:11 - Unknown: Yesterday because we were discussing the Testimonial Task, I refrained from sharing the Wednesday Lesson with you because I thought it would be too much information for one session.
Therefore I am sharing the Wednesday Lesson with you Today.
Also, Since, I am sharing this one day late, I am extending the deadline to Saturday at 9 AM from Friday at 6 PM.
20/10/22, 18:11 - Unknown: Hello, My Proud Edoofian.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

While going through our conversation, I noticed that you haven't submitted *Wednesday's Lesson* yet.
The deadline to make the submission is *Thursday* *6 PM*. Please make sure that you submit your response before that because the *Academic Board* keeps a very strict check on these things. 
 
The aim of this activity is to make you aware of the life journey of Patrice Motsepe and how you can inculcate his traits in your daily life.
15/07/22, 16:45 - Unknown: After reading the above message, Please share your Project Progress Form, Shamar
16/07/22, 20:44 - Shamar EWYL21E0423: Good morning sir, l am a proud edoofian
16/07/22, 20:44 - Shamar EWYL21E0423: Sorry for the late responses, l haven't been quite feeling okay lately
16/07/22, 20:45 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Shamar, Can you please share your understandings regarding the learnings from the last session?
26/07/22, 04:01 - Shamar EWYL21E0423: Good evening sir,l hope you are in good health and spirits. 

It is with no doubt that in order for one to be a succesful entrepreneur and person overally, one has to have the quality of being accountable of one's actions. It is to note that however it is not easy for one to gain this quality as it is has become the norm that whenever anything happens,we tend to want to blame others for the same.  Im order for one to be able to gain accountablity as a quality, he\/she has to make it a habit that whatever he\/she does, whether something good or bad, the person has to take responsibility and ownership of the same actions. I individually plan to do the same, lt will not be easy but l know if l stick to the same, success is guaranteed

I hope that you are in good health and spirits ✨

In the past couple of days, You might have noticed that I was not very active on the EWYL DEDICATED LINE.

This was due to Arrival of 72 Edoofians who came this week.
I am very happy to inform you that all of them are settled and are busy with exploring the universities. ?

Today is the last day of their Admission Processes, So I would be visiting the universities to make sure everything goes well.

We will be starting our regular sessions with full flow from *Monday*.
Till then, I would like you to work on the *EWYL PROJECTS*.

Also, Make sure that you perform the *Proud Edoofian* Ritual on the *EWYL DEDICATED LINE* on Saturday and Sunday as well.
The chain should not break.

Have a blessed day ahead⭐
