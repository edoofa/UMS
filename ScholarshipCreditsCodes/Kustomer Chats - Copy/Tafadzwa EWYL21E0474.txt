Hello my dear Edoofians
Hope you are doing well. This week we learned about one of the most popular yet grounded people who used social media as a tool to become an educator and give back to the community and still become an entrepreneur.
This week I want you to reflect on what your strengths and skills are to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 

These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content etc.
Please share these skills and instances where you were able to showcase these skills on Monday
Till then 
Happy Learning!

It is easy to misunderstand why we take exams.
The purpose of exams is to allow us to understand what we have not understood so far – so that we can learn it again.
The purpose of exams is not – to show someone else (the teacher) how much we know- but to realize how much we know and what we don’t.

25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:34 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well.

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

01/10/22, 18:29 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

No college ever teaches these, which is the primary factor that gives edge to Edoofians over other students.We have very carefully selected the 3 core subjects which will certainly help you equip yourself to the current industry standards. The subjects are:

1) Broad 21st-century skills  money management\/understanding value, communication, digital marketing

2) Industry knowledge kinds of industries are booming, sectoral and job opportunities, new developments in tech - what is crypto, blockchain, NFTs, cyberspace, digital media etc 

3) African Entrepreneurs' stories or success stories of social development
07/10/22, 18:59 - Unknown: So we know, a lot of you have been keeping busy these days with your exams and academic curriculum. And while we wish you all the luck for it, we don't want you to miss out on your learning and skill building. In today's lesson, we will discuss how to build our capacity to multitask, manage our time and prioritize our daily tasks in order to have it all. 

Let's dig right in, and understand how if you follow these steps, you will be able to manage your exams, assignments, extra curriculars, and your EWYL projects all at one go. After going through this, you must discuss the plan of action to execute these steps with your mentors.

Happy Learning!
07/10/22, 19:10 - Tafadzwa EWYL21E0474: I'm sorry it's just that you shared it on Wednesday
07/10/22, 19:21 - Unknown: Tafadzwa, you have to constantly be in contact with me and send *I am a proud edoofian* everyday so that you do not miss out on activities and lessons
07/10/22, 22:17 - Tafadzwa EWYL21E0474: Ok
07/10/22, 22:45 - Unknown: *Check this out, this is the response I received by one of my students and I am expecting the same out of you*


What I have learnt so far is that there are steps that will help me in managing my exams, assignment, extracurricular and ewyl projects at one go.the first step is to set a vision and it gives me a mind of finding a practical use for my time efficiently.always remembering the bigger picture and spending time on things that move closer to my vision. Secondly is to create a masterlist daily where I will be listing tasks to be done on that particular day and it gives me a picture of what my day is going to look like and remembering all that needed to be done. Thirdly is to find my productive cycle by finding the time of the day when I have a huge amount of focus and energy and start executing the most important task . Lastly is leveraging people, I have to delegate my tasks and make best use of resources available and it helps me increase my work efficiency. I have to believe in others vision and support them to interchange and help me
07/10/22, 23:28 - Tafadzwa EWYL21E0474: Wow this is nice

I would like to share a brief message about the importance of planning in our lives and as an organization as well!


Planning is definitely significant as it directs us where to go, it furnishes direction and decreases the danger of risk by making predictions. The significant advantages of planning are provided below:
Planning provides directions: Planning assures that the objectives are certainly asserted so that they serve as a model for determining what action should be taken and in which direction. If objects are well established, employees are informed of what the company has to do and what they need do to accomplish those purposes.
Planning decreases the chances of risk: Planning is an activity which permits a manager to look forward and predict changes. By determining in prior the tasks to be completed, planning notes the way to deal with changes and unpredictable effects.
Planning decreases overlapping and wasteful activities: Planning works as the foundation of organising the activities and purposes of distinct branches, departments, and people. It assists in avoiding chaos and confusion. Since planning guarantees precision in understanding and action, work is conducted on easily without delays.
