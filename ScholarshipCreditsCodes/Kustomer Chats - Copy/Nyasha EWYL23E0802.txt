05/12/23, 16:01 - Nyasha EWYL23E0802: I prefer the first option
05/12/23, 16:07 - Saloni Rastogi: That is great, so can you share how will you be working on it?
05/12/23, 16:18 - Nyasha EWYL23E0802: Ok I will approach my fellow school mates with this wonderful scholarship program Edoofa  and encourage them to  take part in this program  if them  agree I will share the application forms with them so that they would fill them
05/12/23, 16:26 - Saloni Rastogi: That is great, and I saw that you shared two forms with me, superb work!
05/12/23, 16:26 - Saloni Rastogi: Now in this similar pace, we need to accelerate our performance.
05/12/23, 16:27 - Nyasha EWYL23E0802: Thank you very much
05/12/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Did you form the WhatsApp group that we talked about?
05/12/23, 16:42 - Nyasha EWYL23E0802: Which group
05/12/23, 16:42 - Nyasha EWYL23E0802: Do you mean the one I created or my EWYL23EO8O2 group
05/12/23, 16:46 - Saloni Rastogi: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
05/12/23, 16:46 - Saloni Rastogi: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You‚Äôre supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*

For eg: In your case, it will be-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*
05/12/23, 16:47 - Saloni Rastogi: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
05/12/23, 16:47 - Saloni Rastogi: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
05/12/23, 16:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
05/12/23, 16:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
05/12/23, 16:48 - Nyasha EWYL23E0802: Ok thanks I will do so
05/12/23, 16:50 - Nyasha EWYL23E0802: I had managed to create the group but it consist of two students
05/12/23, 16:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Have you added me in the group?
05/12/23, 16:50 - Nyasha EWYL23E0802: Yes
05/12/23, 16:53 - Nyasha EWYL23E0802: The name of the group is Nyasha Edoofa scholarship program
05/12/23, 16:58 - Saloni Rastogi: That is great!
05/12/23, 17:02 - Saloni Rastogi: We're wrapping up today's session, and I'm thrilled about what's coming up tomorrow. I can't wait for our daily ritual to continue, and I'm confident you'll be right on track to dive into Wednesday's lesson with enthusiasm.
Get ready for another dose of knowledge and excitement! See you tomorrow!
05/12/23, 17:20 - Nyasha EWYL23E0802: Thank you for the day
06/12/23, 12:59 - Nyasha EWYL23E0802: Good morning

12/12/23, 15:43 - Nyasha EWYL23E0802: Yes we can
12/12/23, 15:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Nyasha before that, I would like to inform you that you did not receive the Saturday activity since you did not follow the daily ritual on 9th December. I would now share the activity with you and I would encourage you to work on it after the session and share the response with me by today.
12/12/23, 15:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!
12/12/23, 15:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Will it be fine that we discuss the projects now?
12/12/23, 15:59 - Nyasha EWYL23E0802: Ok sorry for not following the daily ritual on Saturday

12/12/23, 16:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me share the resources and messages with you through which you can understand them better.
12/12/23, 16:26 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!üéâ
12/12/23, 16:26 - Nyasha EWYL23E0802: Ok thank you
12/12/23, 16:26 - Saloni Rastogi: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countriesüìç
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
