22/04/23, 14:59 - Hazel EWYL22E1305: Dear Mentor, l haven't had any sessions this week. 
I am also unaware of the Wednesday lesson.
24/04/23, 11:44 - Hazel EWYL22E1305: I'm a proud Edoofian
24/04/23, 11:44 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, ready for a motivational monday?

In a remote village, there lives a hardworking farmer who owns a farm. Over the years his grapery yields rich crops, and the farmer is very successful. He has three sons, who are young and energetic but never worry about working. As the farmer grows older, he begins to worry about his sons‚Äô future.

Then he becomes very ill and feels that his death is coming soon. He calls his sons and says,

‚ÄúDear sons, I see my death approaching, but I want to share a secret before you all leave. These areas have treasure hidden inside. Dig the whole area after my death, to find it. ‚Äù

The old farmer died. The sons start digging for money without leaving any part of the field but nothing is found. In any case, digging their fields leads to healthier crops and results in higher incomes. These earnings make the sons realize what their father means.

What according to you is the moral of the story?

a. Hard work always pays off. The fruits of hard work are always sweet.
b. Be Selflessly kind
c. both a & b
24/04/23, 11:48 - Hazel EWYL22E1305: I think A is correct and also B in the sense that despite his lazy sons the farmer continued to work hard in order to provide for them and also left them with words of wisdom that would help them in the future.

As we go through life, we all make decisions - some good, and some bad. But what separates good decisions from bad decisions, and how can we learn from our experiences to make better choices in the future?

For your Saturday assignment, I would like you to write about your understanding of good decisions and bad decisions. What factors do you consider when making a decision, and how do you know when you have made a good or bad choice? In addition, I would like you to share an example from your life where you made a good or bad decision. What was the situation, what decision did you make, and what was the outcome? What did you learn from this experience, and how has it shaped your decision-making process in the future?

Your submission should be around 200 words in total, and I encourage you to reflect deeply on your experiences and thoughts on decision-making. Remember that we can all learn from our mistakes and successes, and by sharing our experiences, we can help each other make better choices in the future.

09/05/23, 14:39 - Hazel EWYL22E1305: *Decision Making* - _Good and Bad decisions_ 

Making decisions is an essential skill for many professions,  but it's a skill that we need in our personal lives.We need to be able to make decisions not only for ourselves,  but also for the people around us.  The ability to make decisions is a skill that is mostly learnt through experience. 

A good decision has a positive impact in one's life and a bad decision has a negative impact in one's life. Moreover,  good decisions usually lead to more opportunities. However when you make a bad, it can have repercussions which are not immediately apparent, but can have long lasting consequences. 

So making a bad decision is never fun. I‚Äôd like to think that most of us prefer not to make them but can‚Äôt help to sometimes because we think a bad decision isn‚Äôt that bad. It might even be a good one in the right mind set. My bad decision is one I think most are guilty of, waiting until the last minute on something important. In my case a paper due for a class that I didn‚Äôt start working on until the weekend before it was due. Now waiting until the last minute to start the paper itself wasn‚Äôt the bad decision but act of trying to get it done in time since I chose to procrastinate was. To start off evaluating why I was silly enough to do this I have to start off with my purpose of thinking. For me at the time my purpose of thinking was to decide on how I should write my paper in time for the due date. I figured that I didn't get good grades due to this whereas if l had given myself time, my work would have been of better quality. 

Thus from every bad decision l have made in life, l have learnt to consider certain things before l do something, that is :
1. Asking myself what outcome I require. 
2. Considering what happens if l take action and also if l don't. 
3. Thinking about how much time and energy would be needed for the decision l need to make. 
4. Considering the probability of achieving my desired outcome or goal if l take this course of action or if l don't take any action. 
5. Thinking about the pros and cons associated with my chosen decision.
