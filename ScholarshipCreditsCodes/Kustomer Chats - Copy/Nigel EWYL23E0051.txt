I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to let you know that today's Wednesday lesson is going to be a special one. We'll be delving into a captivating story that revolves around the themes of skill, hard work, and determination.

The moral of this story is a powerful one, and it's a lesson that we can carry with us throughout our lives: "Sometimes the truest treasures lay not in the allure of gold but in the craftsmanship and effort one invests in their work." This story will remind us of the value of dedication and the importance of striving for excellence in everything we do.

So, come prepared to listen, learn, and be inspired by this tale of determination and the rewards it can bring. We'll discuss the story, its characters, and the valuable lesson it imparts.

See you in our upcoming session, and let's explore the world of skill, hard work, and the true treasures that lie within our reach.

Best regards,
Team EWYL!

Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

From the Wednesday Wisdom which was focusing on the topic Student Leader I understood the below aspects
*A student leader demonstrate(show's) and influence great qualities to peers. Thus demonstrating action, behavior and attitude. To become a leader,one needs commitment, dedication and passion over activities and people his working with. Leaders need to lead with example such that others knows the right lane(path) to undertake. Leadership also needs creative minds, that things ways of solving problems in a clear and clean way(smart minds).  Also leaders should learn to adopt easily to new environments such that strong bonds with peers or people around  can be created. Moreso, effective communication(two-way-communication) should be practised and should also be willing to take risks and up to social help. A great leader also should listen to other peoples ideas whilst he or she has his/her own idea.*
