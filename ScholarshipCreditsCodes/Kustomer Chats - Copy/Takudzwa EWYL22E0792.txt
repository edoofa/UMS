14/02/23, 18:46 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0792: It came to me as a joke when l was told that l was to take part in organising the Annual speech and pricing giving day. I had many duties that l had to adare to, scheduling of the big event's timetable, cleaning inside and outside the hall, arranging of chairs in order of who was to sit on it pupils, parents, school staff and very important people respectively. The stage also had to be well decorated for the event not forgetting the rest rooms to be well cleaned and labelling of the school pathways indicating every direction.

During the process l faced challenges from some pupils who would sneak out leaving the duty undone taking advantage that l won't recognise them since there were many pupils at the school. Secondly l faced challenges from some informal leaders within the groups who would mislead others into not doing the assigned duty.

Upon noticing the challenge l resorted to assigning a group leader to each group and to compile a least of his or her members to make sure that noone would sneak out from others. Secondly on the issue of informal leaders l had to approach them individually and appointed them group leaders such that they will not go against me.

When the time for the big event arrived, the school headmaster, on his welcome speech remarked that the environment was very clean and welcoming. I did felt proud of my leadership.
