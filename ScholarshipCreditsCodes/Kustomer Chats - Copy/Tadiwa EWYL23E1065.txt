21/01/24, 21:33 - Tadiwa EWYL23E1065: Overcoming fear and procrastination


Fear is the emotion that causes one to be afraid of something while procrastination is the action of delaying or postponing something that should be done. These two can be a hinderence to people who want to achieve success.Taking immediate action and quick decision making is crucial sometimes in the journey of being successful.For example when one has an opportunity to speak out and share an innovative idea with successful people, if the person let fear get hold of them and fail to overcome it by standing in front of the audience woth confidence and risking, they lose the opportunity to share the idea and get feedback from successful people hence fear would have hindered them. Procrastination is another hinderence to success. When a person postpones and delays the time in which work and tasks should be done, it slows down their progress hence also delaying the outcome
