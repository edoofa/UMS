How are you feeling now?

12/07/22, 22:06 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

To be able to successfully lead projects and partake in them it is vital to have certain skills that will most guarantee you the best results.
When it comes to some projects where working with other students is required, communication skills and teamwork are much needed. These make working together easier, tasks are divided more effectively and help is issued where needed.
Attention to detail and problem solving skills are also much important. As projects and tasks are being done, problems are bound to arise. Being able to solve those problems relieves the work load and things run more smoothly.
Networking and linking up with different people also refreshes the mind, giving new ideas and a different perspective on how to complete a certain task or solve a certain problem.
In the 21st century, It and computer skills have become the center of our ever evolving world. These skills are easy to learn and most of the time basic computer skills are required to be able to lead and complete certain projects.
Stepping up to the plate when needed also shows great leadership and people tend to trust working with you in their work. All this combined can help build accountability and build trust in you, thus earning yourself the chance to work on future projects that will help your career.
14/07/22, 16:42 - Unknown: Good Morning, Nkosinothando ?
I hope that you are good health and spirits
14/07/22, 16:43 - Unknown: Nkosinothando, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.
This way you will always be recognized by the Academics Board for new projects.

Agriculture Industry

Zimbabwe has been known to have rich African soil that is used to farm and grow the country's main food supply.
In the past years this industry has grown and continues to grow. From keeping animals to horticulture this industry is the main drive for Zimbabwe's economy.
One of the greatest exports Zimbabwe has to offer in its agricultural sector is tobbaco. It continues to carry Zimbabwe's economy and it brings in a lot of foreign currency which drives many sectors of the eco economy itself.
In addition to that it provides employment to many Zimbabweans and contributes a large percentage to the country's GDP.
Farmers are emerging everyday in Zimbabwe and its now a booming industry that is providing income for a lot of families and helps supplement even their daily food intake and nutrition.
Despite this being such a booming industry, it is not without its challenges. Mainly climate change,availability of fertilizers and capital to keep such a huge industry running. It requires careful planning and implementation, with experts from soil quality, product management and distribution and most importantly financial management.
Technology is slowly becoming a threat to traditional ways of agriculture. Certain technologies which control temperature and conditions to enable maximum produce are not readily available to underdeveloped countries like Zimbabwe, where agriculture is a main source of income.
Despite these challenges there is always ways around them and Zimbabwe continues to thrive in this business and is becoming a force to be reckoned with.

22/07/22, 18:15 - Unknown: Greetings Proud Edoofian ✨
I hope that you are doing well

As August Intake is right at our doorsteps, So due to this many of our Edoofians will be arriving here in India to kick start their dream journey.?

I feel that it is my duty to make sure that the university has prepared well for their onboarding process.

This is why I would be visiting the universities Today in order to do a personal check up.
Since, This process would take up lots of time that is why we won't be able to connect Today.
However, I am sure that in my absence, You will make sure that you follow the below given things:

1. Make sure to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual at 9 AM Tomorrow.
2. Do submit the Wednesday Lesson before the deadline.
23/07/22, 04:42 - Nkosinothando EWYL21E0782: Wednesday lesson takeaway 
Being able to accept failures and learn from them is key to being successful.
Never shift blame on anyone else for things that you had a hand in doing.
Having a positive attitude and mindset will benefit your career and personal life
People who continually use excuses achieve nothing and are more prone to fail
Hard work is necessary to get far in life. Nothing magically comes into your possession. Everything you have is a result of hard work and dedication.
23/07/22, 19:32 - Unknown: Good Morning, Proud Edoofian ?
I hope that you are doing well
23/07/22, 19:33 - Unknown: I am very glad to see your submission.
If you have to point out one major learning from this lesson.
May I know what it would be?
23/07/22, 20:16 - Nkosinothando EWYL21E0782: Positive attitude can take you far in terms of success
25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
