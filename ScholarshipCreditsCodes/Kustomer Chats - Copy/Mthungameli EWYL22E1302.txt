01/06/23, 21:48 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302: Good evening. I have watched the reel, I understand the concerns that the edoofian raised on the legitimacy of Scholarships. But judging from the Testimonials of Edoofians in India I can tell that Edoofa is a world class Scholarship program. From the way they are interested in the student's daily life you can tell that the Edoofa Mentors take good care of their students. It's good to know that Wherever i am going I will be secure with you guys.

Wait on the link for 1 or 2 minutes and you will be accepted.
08/06/23, 16:23 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302: I learnt a lot , to summarize a fiew out of the 7 outlines of the book. I will like point out the ones that really got me thinking, 
1. The one on developing a competitive advantage,  so that one identifies his strengths and works on them more.
Embracing a beta mindset,  whereby you are willing to always learn new things and further educate yourself ✅. 
3. Network intelligence,  where one has to connect with other people of the same path he/she is taking. A better Network means your horizon is wider and much more profitable. 
4. Building alliances , reminds me of the statement that was said by one of the co founders of Edoofa during our meet and greet in Bulawayo. He said that we as Edoofians are already in an alliance with Edoofa as we work as a team. Already I have benefited from your Wednesday wisdom, I am starting to realize a lot of things that Were foreign to me. The importance of Marketing through social media, blogging, Content writing etc. These concepts are new where I come from, but due to an alliance with people from different parts of the world , information is now easier to get.
08/06/23, 16:23 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302: I am still trying to get good Network.
08/06/23, 16:51 - Aditi Kapoor: We are done with today's call session, however we shall continue here since you could'nt have made it
08/06/23, 16:53 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302: Yes please update me what it was about

08/06/23, 17:35 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302: Wow that's beautiful.
08/06/23, 17:36 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302: I wanted to ask, Isn't it possible that the Administration of Edoofa in Zim creates a group for Edoofians who are from Bulawayo and looking forward to go to India?

This weekend we go back to the basics of EWYL with our 3 important keys! 
 Link: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtPOMh0pgPs/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA== 

Share in the comments if you have known this before and why is it important!!
10/06/23, 15:54 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week’s Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better—together. It’s why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger—as successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!

23/06/23, 18:08 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello Edoofian,
We hope this message finds you well in your academic pursuits. We are excited to share a Saturday activity centered around learning from influential personalities. Our chosen figure is Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of Liberia and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Through her remarkable leadership and unwavering determination, she has left an indelible mark on history. Let's draw valuable lessons from her life for our personal development.

Two traits that stand out about Ellen Johnson Sirleaf are resilience and visionary leadership. These qualities can greatly contribute to our growth and development as individuals. They can positively impact our academic pursuits, relationships, and future career goals.

To develop resilience, we can learn from Sirleaf's ability to bounce back from challenges. We can seek out difficult experiences and learn from them, cultivating a mindset of perseverance and adaptability.

Here are some suggestions to help you get started:

Identify two traits: Reflect on Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's qualities that resonate with you.

Reflect on personal development: Consider how these traits can positively impact your academic pursuits, relationships, or future career goals.

Create an action plan: Outline practical steps like seeking mentorship, practicing self-discipline, engaging in community service, or pursuing relevant courses and extracurricular activities.
Let's embark on this exciting journey together and make Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's legacy an integral part of our own lives.
Best regards,

Team Edoofa

Comment if you have been working on the community building project and how many aspiring Edoofians have enrolled through you!
28/06/23, 15:52 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

29/06/23, 10:14 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302: I found yesterday's Wednesday Wisdom very motivational. I think that it's true that internal growth is important. Arguably more importantly than external growth in my opinion. Because once one alligns his habits to personal growth,  every external desire falls into place.
29/06/23, 15:51 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello dear Edoofian! Are you ready for the session? I hope you have gone through the Lesson shared with you yesterday!

29/06/23, 19:54 - Aditi Kapoor: I'm glad to hear that you found Wednesday Wisdom motivational!

When we focus on personal growth and align our habits and actions with our core values and aspirations, it has a profound impact on our overall well-being and success.
29/06/23, 20:03 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302: I apologize. I had no electricity my phone was off since yesterday.

Tell us if these were helpful for you in the comments below!
30/06/23, 18:02 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello Mthungameli
30/06/23, 18:02 - Aditi Kapoor: Have you understood the Grant Document shared with you?
30/06/23, 18:09 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302: Good day to you
30/06/23, 18:10 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302: I believe I have an understanding on what the grant was about.
30/06/23, 18:11 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302: The 21 Day challenge, beginning Monday next week (3rd of July) . Where I will have to attend each and every session and also complete my Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activities.
30/06/23, 18:29 - Aditi Kapoor: Awesome!
30/06/23, 18:29 - Aditi Kapoor: Active Participation is Key to the Grant Challenge!
As we enter the grant challenge, I wanted to remind you about the importance of active participation. While your involvement thus far has been partial, let us take this challenge to turn over a new leaf as it's essential to take this opportunity seriously and make the most out of it.
Active participation not only increases your chances of winning the grant but also allows you to gain valuable skills, knowledge, and experiences. By engaging wholeheartedly in the projects, you will unlock your true potential and contribute significantly to your personal growth.
30/06/23, 18:29 - Aditi Kapoor: We have been having sessions regularly however let me redefine what a session is again.
In order for us to have a successful session, I will be evaluating each session on 3 particular points to be eligible for the Grant.

1. You have to share the "Proud Edoofian" ritual before 12:00PM to mark your attendance
2. You have to share your understanding and complete the Wednesday Lesson or Saturday Activity task before your next session and submit it before the session starts.
3. Between the Community Building and the School Project, you have to choose either one of them or both for the next 21 days and we will set the targets by 1st July, which you will be completing by the end of the 21 days.

And last but not the least, you will have to come up with something which you think will make you stand out from the rest. It will be your best skill so you can discuss with me about this today over the Session.
30/06/23, 18:31 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302: Noted.
30/06/23, 18:33 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302: Question,  on coming up with a skill that will make me stand out, I would like to know what kind of presentation are you expecting?
01/07/23, 14:10 - Aditi Kapoor: It can be anything which you can record on a video and should be a good skill you can present
01/07/23, 14:10 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!
01/07/23, 23:21 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302: If I were to be a protagonist , my Story line would begin with a young men who had grown for close to 18 years but never really understood where he was going. A young man who went to school simply because he had to, but never really understood the core importance of Education. Just like many I had no idea as to what life brings to us, what choices are right for you and which ones aren't. It's quite sad if you think of it, that I only got these answers recently after High School, but quite the Privilege considering that my career path is just getting started. 

My Transformation. 
There are many factors that lead to genuine Transformation in an individual,  some are long term and some are the final triggers that lead to total transformation. My first realization experience is my most recent one. When after High School I was looking for temporary jobs and work, just to get myself busy while I wait for the University window to open. I realized that the real world is nothing like school,  a whole different atmosphere. Men and women go through everything and anything to afford a basic living, for their children to attend classes and learn. Their lives are on a loop, to make that small income and invest in their children's futures. I had conversations with quite a number of them, they all had one advice to me , to work as hard as I can and invest in skills that are profitable whilst am young and whilst I have minimal responsibilities. They emphasized a lot on personal development,  to build my mindset towards being successful in life, financial literacy and professionalism.  Because these are the qualities that the real word requires. All this wisdom has been enough to make me realize how important my youthful days are. That I shouldn't waste them on unproductive pleasures. 


What does my Success look like?
Most would assume by Success I mean money, or superficiality.  Well partly,  but moreover my success is simply the ability to get everything done, to build an empire along my career path , to be the most reliable asset in my family and society. Success to me, is having the freedom, freedom to choose who I associate with, freedom to do good without any financial set backs. To not be controlled by any idea that goes against my beliefs etc. The ability  to be my own man and create a safe space for my companions is what I prioritize most! I have come across multiple situations that required a helping hand to other underprivileged people. But because I also lack , It becomes impossible to be of help, just empathy . But imagine a situation where everywhere I go, I leave a family changed,  happier and hopeful about their future  , isn't that great? Isn't that feeling better than all the money in any bank account? I think it is.

But unfortunately or fortunately,  life requires dreams accompanied by hardwork🫱🏽‍🫲🏽. Only through a self disciplined mentality,  optimistic thinking and personal development can a man become great. It is not only a difficult task but also a patience seeking one, one that takes time and effort to be a success. Through consistently investing in education and connecting with successful people,  I intend to grow and be more eligible for This Title as a successful man. I believe Tertiary education is one of the first steps to connecting and building empires that  are profitable. Taking this journey seriously will guarantee my success at  the end. I am just glad I realized this sooner than later.
