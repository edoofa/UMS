I'm sharing this information with my students early because these external projects will be considered as valuable experience when they pursue their future dream jobs!
These projects will only be offered to students who have excelled in the EWYL journey and previous projects, as they demonstrate dedication and consistency. So, I think it's essential for us to start preparing as soon as possible. Together, we will brainstorm creative ways to maintain our positive reputation and excellent record. What are your thoughts on this?
31/08/23, 13:41 - BLESSING EWYL23E0338: That's sounds great ma'am as for me lm wholy prepare
31/08/23, 13:44 - Ananya: Indeed, last year when students came to India, only well-performing students were offered some amazing projects and had the opportunity to work with renowned brands like Sirona!
Therefore, I want you to be proactive and consistent with your EWYL projects so that you can uphold your reputation in the EWYL department. This way, when an external project comes up, your name will immediately come to mind as a top candidate. Keep up the hard work, and you'll create more opportunities for yourself in the future!
31/08/23, 13:44 - BLESSING EWYL23E0338: Ok thank you ma'am
