17/03/23, 03:28 - Kester EWYL22E0495: On the Wednesday Wisdom I have understood that one should seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep meaning the value of your assets continues to grow even when you are not actively working or earning money. For example if you invest in a real estate, the value of your property can appreciate over time , even if you are not actively managing it. Seeking wealth not money or status can provide a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial stability and success.

The key to building wealth is to focus on creating assets that generate passive income. Money is simply a tool to help you achieve your financial goals . And status on the other hand is your place in the social heirarchy which is often associated with wealth and money , but it is important to remember that status is not a measure of true success and happiness

19/03/23, 15:30 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Morning Kester
19/03/23, 15:32 - Jasmine Kaur: Here is your activity for the week. 

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!
REMINDER  sure to complete this activity before our next session and submit it when I will ask for it.

I hope this message finds you well. As your EWYL progresses, it is important that you stay up to date with your assignments and coursework. In order to ensure that you are able to move forward with the new lessons, I want to remind you that you must complete all of your previous assignments by the end of this week.

It is essential that you take the time to thoroughly review and complete your previous assignments. Doing so will not only help you to understand the lesson better, but it will also prepare you for the upcoming lessons. Failure to complete the previous assignments may result in a delay of the new lessons, and ultimately, it may impact your EWYL progress.

Therefore, I urge you to make the completion of your previous assignments a priority. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to seeing your completed assignments and to sharing the new lessons with you soon.

Best regards,
Team EWYL","transform":"

03/04/23, 21:18 - Jasmine Kaur: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

As a student l need to be consistent for my skill development and career growth. Consistency is not just a one time thing but means following a routine and dedicating a certain amount of time every day for studying. It is a well established fact that consistent hard work and dedication are essential for achieving one's goals.
_ consistency in studies is crucial for a student's academic success. Regular and consistent study habits helps students to understand and retain the concepts better , which ultimately reflects in their goals.
_consistency in practice is vital for developing skills be it music , sports or any other skill , consistent practice helps for mastering it. Without consistency students will find it challenging to develop the necessary skills required for their future careers.
_consistency in learning is very important for career growth. It helps students to stay updated with latest trends and advancement in their field of interest. With consistent leaning students can stay ahead of the competition and archive their career goals.
To sum up consistency is very crucial in students' lives for it enables them to attain their goals and future careers.
