Happy new week my proud Edoofian! How are you doing today?
12/07/22, 21:20 - Unknown: Kudzai, did you work on the Weekend activity? 
It was an interesting one and related to the EWYL projects and really fascinated me.
13/07/22, 13:39 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: Hello my proud Edoofians hope you are doing well. \u2028\u2028You must have learned how critical it is to take advantage of every opportunity. In our Wednesday Wisdom this week, we discussed a profitable business- Skooqs. Do you know that Skooqs was developed in just five days!! Thanks to Oluwadamilola Soyombo's (Founder of Skooqs), diligence and use of the opportunity. The use of the opportunity at the right time with the right skills is currently creating a significant impact on the African entrepreneurial ecosystem.  And well some of you, because of your consistency, diligence, willingness to show up for your sessions, and performance in your weekly activities have gotten this opportunity to work on a project with Skooqs. 

You are probably aware of the possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. This week, I want you to think of a few skills or practices that a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits. 
Please list the skills that are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring in a lot of learning.

You are required to share your response in 150 to 200 words over the dedicated EWYL line by Monday 9 AM.
13/07/22, 13:43 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: Some of the possible skills that are required for a student to experience if they worked hard or not may include consultancy, consistency attendance,
Practicing and also taking your time to actually revise what you are working on before submitting it, however i believe communication besides the above also helps and again seeking help if one is struggling with anything
13/07/22, 19:51 - Unknown: Hello my proud edoofian! How are you? Please send the proud edoofian message for the day.
13/07/22, 19:52 - Unknown: Good work on the Weekend activity Edoofian! Do you now know what from this list of skills you are executing to get selected for the projects?
13/07/22, 20:01 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: May you explain further sir
14/07/22, 01:48 - Unknown: You see the top skills you need are the ability to be consistent and to be hardworking. Listening to the my instructions as they are to help you build your future and executing them with passion for your own success.
14/07/22, 03:45 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: Thank you sir

Greeting of the day my proud edoofian! How are you doing?
14/07/22, 21:52 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: Greetings from Kudzai a proud Edoofian
14/07/22, 21:53 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

15/07/22, 00:30 - Unknown: Did you work on the Wednesday wisdom task I shared with you yesterday Kudzai?

15/07/22, 21:26 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: The major take away i got from the Wednesday lesson was that of dedication and of focus
The determination that he had and also to note that he was patient things might not have flown at first but eventually it came to happen
15/07/22, 23:41 - Unknown: Amazing work on the Lesson task. I saw that Patrice had the wisdom to recognize and grab the opportunities that time brought for him and that is what set him apart from others and made him who he is.

Do you agree on this Kudzai?
15/07/22, 23:50 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: Yes i do sir
16/07/22, 00:30 - Unknown: Now recognizing and grabbing the opportunities that come at hand is crucial. Do you believe you do that as well?
16/07/22, 21:51 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: Yes sir
16/07/22, 21:51 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: Good afternoon
21/07/22, 14:12 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: Hello my proud Edoofian! 

We are back with another Wednesday wisdom. I am sure you will agree to the fact that attitude plays a major role in our day-to-day life. It is also a waste of time if the proper attitude and effective abilities are not developed. In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we discuss a crucial character quality that everyone should work on and make sure they have mastered the right attitude. Once you have read the full lesson, We will be having the discussion concerning the same in our next session. Write down if you have any questions or key observations from the lesson. 

Happy learning!
21/07/22, 14:13 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: Good morning sir

21/07/22, 14:16 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: Some of the major takeaways i took from the above lesson are that, for one to be successful, he or she has to work and if things don't go as planned only losers blaim it on other people, just like Ocean who started blaming her cruelty to men on other elements.
I also learnt that one has to learn to admit that things are not going well and learn to work on it.

Greeting of the day, my proud Edoofian! How are you doing?
21/07/22, 20:14 - Unknown: Did you work on the Wednesday wisdom Edoofian? What are your takeaways from it?
21/07/22, 20:15 - Unknown: I just saw your response Kudzai, Good to read  it! I am glad that you were able to understand the crux of that which is that successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it.
21/07/22, 23:08 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: Thank you sir
21/07/22, 23:08 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: Good afternoon sir

22/07/22, 01:04 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: One has to seek help from the person giving the project or people around
22/07/22, 01:31 - Unknown: Yes that is correct and you have to be confident and open to learn.
22/07/22, 01:31 - Unknown: You have to be the owner of your success, you will face many challenges in terms of time management, internet and in regards to efficiency on the projects as well. However, you will have to make sure that you are working on the projects and making the best of the opportunity right?
22/07/22, 01:33 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: Yes sir
22/07/22, 01:36 - Unknown: So now how do you believe you have to use this approach and mindset on your projects Edoofian? Such as the community building project, Corporate alliance project or the School connect project?

25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.

04/08/22, 18:15 - Unknown: Kudzai, Did you read the super interesting story of 19 year old Gilbert Eugene Peters from Zimbabwe that I shared with you yesterday?

I am sure you must have found his life inspiring and learnt a few things from it.
06/08/22, 00:34 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: Also, Kudzai, Today's Wednesday lesson shares with us the details of how a 19-year old started his journey of running a successful business and today has a majority market share in Zimbabwe, successfully handling brand portfolios worth over $870 million. 

After you have read the pdf carefully shared below, share with me your major takeaways and the inspiration you got from Gilbert Eugene Peters' story. 

Happy learning!
06/08/22, 00:35 - Kudzai EWYL22E0060: From the Above lesson i learnt that age is just a number and it doesn't take one to grow up inroder to succeed, i leant that it begins at that early stage and if one is given the chance to do big they better work and to also make use of the opportunity as well
06/08/22, 02:09 - Unknown: Good to read your understanding of the lesson Kudzai. The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years. The price is knowing that time is working on your side even when the results don’t show it.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off
