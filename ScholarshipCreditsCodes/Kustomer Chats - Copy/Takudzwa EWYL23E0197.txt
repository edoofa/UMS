05/01/24, 22:49 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Evening Takudzwa
Let us start today's session with a fun question -

If you could create a new country on any unclaimed land in the world, what would you name it, and what values or principles would be the foundation of your utopian society?
05/01/24, 23:14 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0197: Good evening to you too,  If I could create my own country, I would name it "Infinitopia." It would be founded on the principles of inclusivity, innovation, and sustainability. üåéüå± I would want it to be a place where everyone is welcome and everyone has an equal opportunity to thrive. I would want it to be a place where creativity and imagination are celebrated, and where new ideas are always encouraged. And I would want it to be a place that is dedicated to preserving the environment and protecting the planet for future generations.
05/01/24, 23:19 - Jasmine Kaur: Your vision for "Infinitopia" sounds truly inspiring and aligns with noble values. Your vision for "Infinitopia" holds great potential, and I'd be eager to hear more about how you envision turning these ideals into a reality. Keep up the visionary thinking! üåêüåø

_Welcome to the first activity of the year!_
As part of today's Saturday activity, we invite you to share your personal experiences from any event you have attended, whether it be a seminar, workshop, or any other gathering. Our Wednesday lesson already highlighted the skills and experiences we can gain by our active participation in events that are aimed at sharing the Industry experience with young students.

Please take a moment to reflect on the event you attended, and share the key learnings, observations, and any memorable moments. Feel free to include pictures that capture the essence of the event.

For those who haven't had the chance to attend any events yet, don't worry! We encourage you to share your expectations from such gatherings. What do you hope to gain? What are your goals and aspirations when attending future events? This is a chance for you to articulate your thoughts and set intentions for your learning journey.

Remember, everyone's perspective is valuable, and by sharing our experiences, we create a supportive community that thrives on collaboration and shared knowledge. Let's make this Saturday activity a meaningful and insightful exchange of experiences and expectations. Thank you for your active participation!
