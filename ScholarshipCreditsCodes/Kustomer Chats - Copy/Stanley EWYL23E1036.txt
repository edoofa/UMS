11/01/24, 18:46 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Okay, as exposed by this link above, International exposure can benefit my career since it gives me a proper insight on how to handle things.  As l  was going through the pages I saw some proud Edoofians having some carrier guidances, good lecturing skills and also I can see their successes through this page. As such I can comment that this program is a wonderful program to those who are motivated in learning. It also gives opportunities for one to even fly high and also come with flying colors moreover it covers most people's motives to study abroad. Therefore I can see to my own point of view this scholarship program is the Paramount to every Edoofian to reach highest levels of Education and the scholarship and also to have a high employment step in life

12/01/24, 13:09 - Ananya: Good morning, Stanley!

How are you doing?
12/01/24, 13:10 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: I'm doing great Mentor
12/01/24, 13:10 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: How you doing  today
12/01/24, 13:24 - Ananya: Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
12/01/24, 13:26 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Okay that is amazing  to hear you guys enjoyed very well
12/01/24, 13:27 - Ananya: .
12/01/24, 13:27 - Ananya: .
12/01/24, 13:27 - Ananya: .
12/01/24, 13:27 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Wow wow
12/01/24, 13:28 - Ananya: .
12/01/24, 13:28 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Wow that's so great
12/01/24, 13:49 - Ananya: By the way, I checked your response and your perspective on the link and the opportunities provided by international exposure is spot on! It's fantastic that the link showcases the success stories and achievements of Edoofians, highlighting the benefits of the program. Recognizing the importance of career guidance, excellent lecturing skills, and the overall success of participants speaks volumes about the quality of the program.
12/01/24, 13:50 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Really  thank you Ms Ananya
12/01/24, 13:55 - Ananya: Now moving ahead I want to discuss something really important with you. You know, seeing over 400 students in this event has motivated me to work for my students even harder. I want you to be here in India and pay your fee all by yourself. For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed with a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?
12/01/24, 13:57 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Okay mentor mmm which feedback
12/01/24, 14:13 - Ananya: .
12/01/24, 14:16 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Oooo okay mentor yes I have that feedback for one of my students by the nama Rutendo Tagarira. She said she received a message  for Edoofa and I'm guiding her
12/01/24, 14:20 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Mentor are seeing my progress in my group  I'm having a good relationship with my students and also they we're pleading if you only indicate  that you are there and at least say word, I promised them that today  you will say something  to them please
12/01/24, 14:30 - Ananya: Alright, Stanley, I will try to do that! Now that our session time is over, let's reconvene in our next session on Tuesday! Meanwhile, don't forget to connect with the students over the weekend so that we can meet our target of connecting with at least 5 students next week!
Good luck and have a happy weekend!
12/01/24, 14:31 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Okay you too
12/01/24, 14:31 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: And please just say a word iny group  maam
16/01/24, 13:06 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: I'm a proud  Edoofian
16/01/24, 13:07 - Ananya: Good morning, Stanley

I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:

Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! ðŸ˜„
16/01/24, 13:07 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ that's wonderful
16/01/24, 13:12 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: We can do it for today mentor
16/01/24, 13:28 - Ananya: For today, I have planned something special! Do you know about a resume or a CV?
16/01/24, 13:28 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Noo I would like you to make me know
16/01/24, 13:29 - Ananya: You know, a resume is like a super important paper for students. It shows all the cool things you've done in school and outside. When you want to get into a good school or get a job, you give them your resume so they can see how awesome you are. It's like your personal advertisement that says, 'Hey, I'm really good at these things, and I can do great stuff for you!' So, having a good resume helps you stand out and get cool opportunities.
16/01/24, 13:30 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Okay sure thank you I would  like to make my own resume about Edoofa
16/01/24, 13:37 - Ananya: Well, yesterday I was updating my little brother's resume and took help from this video. I thought to share this with you as well, as he is suggesting some really good things!
https://youtu.be/QnUI3sLZ4hc?si=HTbUElM6TNHZaPlN
16/01/24, 13:37 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Okay let me go through  this
16/01/24, 13:48 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Yes I have gone through  that its a good tutorial
16/01/24, 13:51 - Ananya: By thw way, last time we talked about how you can set yourself a target and work on that over the weekend. Did you manage to plan out your work?
16/01/24, 13:52 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Yes I tried to get some students but some we complaining  that we are the fist students to apply  and we haven't picked yet I resended that in our EWYL group
16/01/24, 13:54 - Ananya: Please let them know that due to a huge number of application forms and the intensive understanding of your application form, it requires a window of 15-20 days for our counselors to connect with you for the counseling session.
16/01/24, 13:56 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Okay thank I would like you to inform them in my group
16/01/24, 14:01 - Ananya: Well, Stanley why don't you to share it by yourself?
16/01/24, 14:02 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Yes I can mentor sure I can its only that if that message comes from you it will have a great impact. But sure I can tell them
16/01/24, 14:06 - Ananya: I understand; however, giving you control has an intent behind it - to make you a student leader and build some leadership skills. If you can manage a set of students and handle them, this will ensure confidence building and leadership abilities.
16/01/24, 14:07 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Sure that my mentor  thats a pretty good  advise
16/01/24, 14:13 - Ananya: Also, you know, you can share the following resources with them:
Did you know that the First Lady of Zimbabwe met the CEO of Edoofa during her visit to India?
Not only this, but Edoofa was also one of the sponsors for the NSQC event!
16/01/24, 14:13 - Ananya: .
16/01/24, 14:14 - Ananya: .
16/01/24, 14:15 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Wow that's great
16/01/24, 14:15 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: I will show them this wonderful clip
16/01/24, 14:28 - Ananya: Great! Now that our session time is over, remember, every effort you put in is a step closer to success. Keep participating, stay motivated, and earn those credits! You're all doing great, and I look forward to our continued journey together. See you next time!

16/01/24, 14:31 - Ananya: Well, keep working on your target of connecting with five students every week!

19/01/24, 13:49 - Ananya: Now, we are preparing ourselves for some external projects. Meanwhile, to grasp this amazing opportunity, we must also work toward our EWYL projects.
To ace those projects and ensure regular input from your end, let's set a target for this week. However, this time I want to ask you to set your own target!
19/01/24, 13:53 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Okay that's so difficult  to think ofðŸ˜‚,  but let me say what about sending 5 students  applications or trying my project 2 of communication with other school heads and give feedback.

I have a vision for both of us â€“ we will earn enough credits so that you won't need to spend a single penny for your second-semester fee, and we will achieve it. Are you in?

Share your favorite motivational quotes in the comments and let's inspire each other to conquer this week together
22/01/24, 20:14 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Okay thank you I'm on it
22/01/24, 20:16 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Yes I have done it
22/01/24, 21:45 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Okay, in this I go for "power of thoughts".  On the power of thoughts, it is elaborated that's whatever one think of may come to pass. This guides people to have a positive mental attitude. This is a train to failure or success in life. Moreover, it shapes reality in our day today lives. For example if one always talks about misfortunes in his lives, those misfortunes will come to reality. Napoleon Hill also exemplified that if you maintain a a positive mind you always have positive impacts as it comes to reality. For instance one will always dreaming of having a good life or something great in his real life that's dream will come to reality since it is always the dream of that person. Lastly, Napoleon suggested that it is very important for one to program his or your mind on success because it will come to pass in reality
23/01/24, 02:30 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: Napoleon Hill emphasized on persistence as one of the most important aspect in growing of any
business establishment.Maintaing something you have started and seeing it through to blossom
regardless of the challenges you might face, you ought to stay resilient. From business analysis there
are situation management systems that include PESTEL, SWOT, Market analysis and marketing
objective they help us in start ups, ascertaining the environment of consideration and carrying out a
feasibility study.
24/01/24, 16:25 - Stanley EWYL23E1036: I'm a proud  Edoofian
