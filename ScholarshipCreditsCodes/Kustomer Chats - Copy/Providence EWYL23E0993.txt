28/12/23, 13:49 - Providence EWYL23E0993: Sorry for late response my network is not performing well
28/12/23, 13:56 - Aditi Kapoor: Certainly! You've delved into the core concepts adeptly:
Understanding the growth mindset is fundamentally recognizing that abilities and intelligence are not fixed traits but can be cultivated through dedication, hard work, and perseverance. This perspective shapes a belief that challenges are opportunities for growth rather than insurmountable obstacles. Additionally, you've emphasized the pivotal role of goal setting in providing direction and purpose to personal and professional journeys. By setting goals for learning and skill development, one ensures a continuous trajectory of improvement. Cultivating resilience in the face of challenges becomes a cornerstone, allowing individuals to develop strategies for overcoming adversity and bouncing back stronger. Furthermore, the importance of promoting a healthy work-life balance is highlighted, advocating for the establishment of boundaries to ensure equilibrium between work, personal life, and self-care. This comprehensive understanding reflects a holistic approach to success and personal well-being. Your articulation underscores the essence of these principles, encouraging a mindset of continuous growth and achievement. üå±üíº
28/12/23, 13:56 - Aditi Kapoor: I understand the challenges, Providence.
28/12/23, 13:56 - Providence EWYL23E0993: Noted
28/12/23, 13:56 - Providence EWYL23E0993: Okay
28/12/23, 14:03 - Aditi Kapoor: So now let's move onto the updates on your projects please.
28/12/23, 14:04 - Providence EWYL23E0993: Okay
28/12/23, 14:10 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, I am waiting for your response.
28/12/23, 14:13 - Providence EWYL23E0993: For now I am doing the third project ,and for the first one my network is not performing well so I will keep on trying .
28/12/23, 14:19 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, noted.
On this Providence, I would like to discuss something that I have discussed before as well that when the school‚Äôs per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
28/12/23, 14:20 - Providence EWYL23E0993: Okay ma'am
28/12/23, 14:28 - Aditi Kapoor: And I hope that you are aware that the School you shared is less than $100.
28/12/23, 14:28 - Providence EWYL23E0993: Yes ma'am
28/12/23, 14:29 - Providence EWYL23E0993: I asked the teacher to create a group so he said he will create when schools open
28/12/23, 14:31 - Providence EWYL23E0993: Is this okay
28/12/23, 14:38 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, great and then you can start the community building project in that particular group, okay?
28/12/23, 14:38 - Aditi Kapoor: Concluding our session, I must express how delightful our interaction has been. I'm eagerly looking forward to our next one.üíØ
