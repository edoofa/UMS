20/06/23, 17:10 - Juliet EWYL22E1125: First of all it's worth considering most of the national income in the world comes from entrepreneurship,  Today I would like to discuss about my favorite inspiration in the marketing business industry that is Divine Ndhlukula ,Ms Divine is one the successful woman living in Africa, she is the founder of managing director of SECURICO zambabwe leading security company, which was founded in 1998.

One of the things I love about her is, even though she started her journey with only two employees she now  has a thousand of employees in a male dominant industry, one of the things I would say I have in common with  her is the aspects to look After staff and embrace new technologies 
But the difference with me and her saying of success comes from hard it also comes from determining and long-term ambitions.

  "Taking all this to into  consideration"  Divine Ndhlukula has taught me that one can become successful in life despite how taught  the road is there always an open spot in business..  to make an improvement and new technological skills.

22/06/23, 17:55 - Juliet EWYL22E1125: Today I'll share my insights understanding  about Ellen Johnson sirlelef who was the first female president in Africa
22/06/23, 18:25 - Juliet EWYL22E1125: The first female president in Africa who is Ellen Johnson sirlelef, has had a positive impact not only to Africans but to the whole world,  despite the fact that she is a woman and faced many challenges such us gender based discrimination and had financial challenges. 

One of the many things I learned from Ms Ellen Johnson sirlelef she that she prioritized integrity and fought against corruption and which brought transparency and accountability among the country 
And Endoofians like me can learn from her that honestly and integrity are essential for leadership, we can also learn  that leadership requires the courage to make difficult decisions and that collaboration and diplomacy are essential tools for achieving shared goals and peace stability, soo Endoofians should embrace  their ability and effect change nomatter their age or background.

28/06/23, 15:55 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

Team EWYL

28/06/23, 15:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

It is your duty to influence aspiring students to join the Edoofa family today and experience a seamless transition into your new home away from home.

Comment if you have been working on the community building project and how many aspiring Edoofians have enrolled through you!
28/06/23, 16:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
28/06/23, 16:01 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
28/06/23, 16:13 - Juliet EWYL22E1125: Ok thanks  noted I'll be doing soo every morning
29/06/23, 10:56 - Juliet EWYL22E1125: I'am  a proud edoofian

29/06/23, 17:00 - Juliet EWYL22E1125: Today I'll share my insights understanding and what I've learned from the Alex's story.  Alex a person who changed this life though a single book that he picked from the park , Alex was an average student he wasn't smart nor was he talented but he had a turning desire to achieve something in life .... Alex read the book and learned concept of identity of based habits,  the book explains,  that instead of focusing on solely external goes one should concentrate on becoming who they aspire to be. He started studying more and make study groups he become a good influence on his fellow mate's 
His taught me that success is control and success does just lie in achievement of external goals but also in the process of becoming the person I aspire to be.

01/07/23, 15:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!
