12/01/23, 17:28 - Roy EWYL21E0938: From the lesson I understood that Charles Thomas Munger, the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, designed 5 models of problem solving. The first one is simplicity of the problem through deciding big, 'no brainer questions. The second one is numerical fluency. Without numerical fluency in the part of life most of us inhabit, you are likely a one legged man In a ass kicking contest. The third notion is studying the basics. The fourth notion is that one must routinely use all the easy to learn concepts from the freshman course in every basic subject. One shouldn't rely on others to solve his or her problems. The last one is combining the really big effects, according to Mr Munga, the Lollapalooza effects. For instance tuberculosis was tamed at least for a long time, only by routine combined use of three different drugs

25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:06 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:32 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well.

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

17/11/22, 05:06 - Unknown: Our scheduled timings are 9:30 AM Zimb Time
17/11/22, 05:07 - Unknown: Wednesday Lesson

Hello, my dear proud Edoofian. I hope all is well with you.

Another insightful Wednesday Wisdom is presented here. The lesson today teaches us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, disability. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition. A few questions near the end of the session will ask you to reflect and have an open dialogue with yourself. After you finish your lesson, as your mentor, I'd like to have a thorough conversation about your key take aways, in our upcoming sessions.

Enjoy the article and keep in mind that success does not come to you suddenly; rather, it can be attained over time by making modest, daily improvements.

Happy learning!

Deadline: Friday 9 AM
17/11/22, 07:46 - Roy EWYL21E0938: Ok
