02/10/22, 14:29 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.

07/10/22, 21:55 - Saloni Rastogi: As students, we constantly learn and expose ourselves to situations that help us learn anything and everything, but we must remember that each of us has the same number of hours in a day. Hence we must treat it important that we treat our Time as the currency of life. *Time Management* is essentially Priority Management.

In our session today on the *EWYL Line*, we will discuss:
1. How managing time is necessary
2. pending discussion on the weekend activity

08/10/22, 14:29 - Siphosenkosi EWYL22E0350: Good Morning i am a proud Edoofian .I am sorry for the delay for the response.

  Yes i did go through the Wednesday lesson and what i learnt was that theres not set time for one to become great ,meaning  to say that nomatter in whatever age one is in...they can start persuibg their dreams, be  interprenuers ... however understanding that positive interprenuership is were by one gives back to the society  solutions that will enhance its growth . So basically all i can  say is that this was a very powerful and encouraging lesson !!

13/10/22, 01:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian!
Hope you are doing well.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real-life example. That is how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because in the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.
Responses will be submitted on the EWYL Line only.

Happy Learning.
13/10/22, 01:27 - Siphosenkosi EWYL22E0350: hope everything is well and progressing accordingly

21/11/22, 23:11 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.

Hope everything is well on your end!

This is to inform you that I will not be available from tomorrow [Wednesday] till Sunday as we are visiting campuses to connect with the students who are already here in India, I would wish to see you here very soon so that I can interact with you as well.


Meanwhile, I would not want to hinder your learning hence I will be sending you some interesting information every day so that we keep up with your pace. Also, I will be sharing some amazing pictures from our campus visit. I hope you get real insight from the same and enjoy seeing it.
