31/01/24, 16:47 - Ananya: Wednesday Lesson
31/01/24, 16:47 - Ananya: Audio.
02/02/24, 01:31 - Linet EWYL22E1044: I am a Proud Edoofian
02/03/23, 22:45 - Linet EWYL22E1044: I learnt that everything is possible , you can start something on a small scale and later ends with good pleasing results as long as you are dedicated to your goals
02/03/23, 23:01 - Ananya: Greetings, Edoofian
I hope that you are doing well
02/03/23, 23:01 - Ananya: I am very happy to see your response.
My major learning from this lesson was that it is important that we analyze our work. After that, we reflect on and improve our mistakes. In the end, We make a strategy to implement the improvements.
I am sure that we will apply these learnings in our EWYL Plan for the month of March.
02/03/23, 23:01 - Ananya: Let us start our Today’s session with this motivational quote:
“Quality is not an act, it is a habit.” —Aristotle
02/03/23, 23:06 - Linet EWYL22E1044: I am fine ..thank you
02/03/23, 23:06 - Linet EWYL22E1044: Yh noted
02/03/23, 23:06 - Linet EWYL22E1044: Awesome
02/03/23, 23:13 - Ananya: So, now I will share specific ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
02/03/23, 23:13 - Ananya: A] Through WhatsApp community groups:


STEP 1: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME\/(slash)MENTOR NAME\/(SLASH)DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED
For eg: a student named Tendai who formed the group on 1st February will name it-
TENDAI\/MENTOR NAME\/1FEB2023
02/03/23, 23:18 - Ananya: I will help you with that
Before we move forward, I would want you to create this group and share the group link with me.
02/03/23, 23:24 - Linet EWYL22E1044: Ohhk
02/03/23, 23:27 - Linet EWYL22E1044: Follow this link to join my WhatsApp group: https:\/\/chat.whatsapp.com\/IBeOnY9ZDAdBus6fY86Fua
02/03/23, 23:29 - Ananya: STEP 2: We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.
02/03/23, 23:29 - Ananya: The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counselling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counselling session thereafter.
02/03/23, 23:30 - Linet EWYL22E1044: Ohhk
02/03/23, 23:31 - Linet EWYL22E1044: If l find a student do l add him\/her or l send a link only
02/03/23, 23:44 - Ananya: Do not share the link
Add them yourself
02/03/23, 23:50 - Linet EWYL22E1044: Ohhk
03/03/23, 00:18 - Ananya: As for attracting the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our Juniors who are in Form 5, and Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
03/03/23, 00:18 - Ananya: Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

04/03/23, 01:55 - Ananya: I am on a visit to meet our Indian Edoofians for a regular meet and greet session. 
Therefore, We won't be able to have our session.
Also, We are taking a bit longer to complete our conversation regarding the Community Building Project and our Targets for the Month of March. I would need you to make sure that YOU are on time for our session tomorrow so that we can complete our discussion.
Have a cheerful day ahead!
04/03/23, 02:57 - Linet EWYL22E1044: What time exactly
04/03/23, 15:50 - Linet EWYL22E1044: I am a proud Edoofian
04/03/23, 18:58 - Ananya: Greetings, Edoofian
I hope that you are in good health and spirits
04/03/23, 18:58 - Ananya: May I know if we can start with our session now?
04/03/23, 19:29 - Linet EWYL22E1044: Yes l am thank you...
04/03/23, 19:30 - Linet EWYL22E1044: Yes we can
04/03/23, 19:35 - Ananya: Great!
I hope that this point is clear to you?


Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
04/03/23, 19:37 - Linet EWYL22E1044: Yh it is
04/03/23, 19:42 - Ananya: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to STUDY IN INDIA with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
04/03/23, 19:44 - Linet EWYL22E1044: Ohhk noted
04/03/23, 19:45 - Ananya: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

And in a very similar manner, you can repeat the same process with the Form 5 students as well.
04/03/23, 19:47 - Linet EWYL22E1044: Ohhk noted
04/03/23, 19:53 - Ananya: *Things to be on a look out for:*

1] ADMIN ACCESS:
04/03/23, 19:53 - Ananya: It is very important that we add the right Student (Applicant) to the group, so please make sure that you YOURSELF add the participants and don’t forward the link of your group blindly. 
It is done so that:
04/03/23, 19:53 - Ananya: 1) We have the right student, by the right student we mean that the groups should have students who are really serious and passionate about their higher education and want to use the scholarship as a stepping stone in their career.
04/03/23, 19:53 - Ananya: 2) We have the students who are known to you and or your friends who you feel that after your initial interaction with them are equally passionate like you to follow your footsteps and build your network. The other benefit being it will directly impact your scholarship credits.
04/03/23, 20:27 - Linet EWYL22E1044: Ohhk noted
04/03/23, 21:47 - Ananya: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community building project, YOU ADD ME and make me the ADMIN of the Group.
Add my number 
04/03/23, 21:48 - Ananya: The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
04/03/23, 21:48 - Ananya: Add this number: +917696398732
04/03/23, 21:56 - Linet EWYL22E1044: I have done that
04/03/23, 22:10 - Ananya: Great!
B] Individual reach out -
04/03/23, 22:10 - Ananya: You can also reach out to the students individually and discuss in detail the Edoofa Program. You should also discuss with them your journey right from submitting your application till you got connected with me. You can inform them about your counsellor, the interviews, admission processes, etc. and once that is done, you can ask them to fill out the Offline Application Form. One thing which you need to keep in mind is that you should only reach out to students who you feel are equally passionate and deserving like you to earn the scholarship. [preferably the ones who have completed their A-Level or are in Form 6\/Form 5]. Also, make sure that you share the correct information with the applicant while sharing the application form.

06/03/23, 17:20 - Ananya: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

I have shared the forms with the counselling team
In the meanwhile, Please make sure that you stay in touch with the students and tend to all of the queries. Our counselling team will be reaching out on priority

07/03/23, 22:55 - Ananya: Now, I will be explaining the type of communication to be used with your applicants when you will reach out to them to fill out the application form shared above.
1. Firstly, You will be explaining to the students What Edoofa is. For this, Please read carefully the messages that I am sharing below:
07/03/23, 22:55 - Ananya: Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of more than 3000 students from different countries.
07/03/23, 22:55 - Ananya: Edoofa receives applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
07/03/23, 23:03 - Linet EWYL22E1044: Ohhk l have shared the information
07/03/23, 23:27 - Ananya: Great!
 Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his\/her understanding of the discussion above. After you are satisfied with the student’s response, you will share about Edoofa’s Meet and Greet Session that happened in Harare. I am sharing the messages regarding that below:
I am sharing the video to your EWYL Group
07/03/23, 23:27 - Ananya: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr Angad Singh and Mr Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

North Star Metric is a key business metric that reflects the core value a product delivers to its customers. It's a single, actionable metric that aligns all efforts towards achieving long-term growth.
