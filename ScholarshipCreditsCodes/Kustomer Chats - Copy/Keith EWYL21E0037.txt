02/10/22, 22:53 - Keith EWYL21E0037: Good planning and hard lead to prosperity, which is true l believe, because prosperity can only be achieved when one works not only hard but also plans their journey well
02/10/22, 22:54 - Keith EWYL21E0037: A shortcut gives a false sense of security and success, it makes you believe there is an easy way out, but wen it fails you have to go back to point A and start again making the distance longer
02/10/22, 22:55 - Keith EWYL21E0037: It's not about the destination but the journey, a familiar saying and a fact, because the journey is what's worth it as the lessons that you learn along the way are just as valuable as the results themselves

13/10/22, 19:14 - Keith EWYL21E0037: Okay sir
13/10/22, 19:15 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.

13/10/22, 22:59 - Keith EWYL21E0037: What l learnt most from it, is first of learning by actions, and that anything can become a career as long as it is effectively executed, for one Wode Maya, showed that how much information you have about a place or people, coincides with your option about them, creating a new narrative, even though he might be an introvert and new and this, he still did it, which is the most important, to start, every successful person started off the same as everyone else,Only difference is they decided to start be it on a small project but they started and kept at it nomatter what

16/07/22, 18:33 - Keith EWYL21E0037: 2)importance for  students learning scratch programming, 

By enabling children to program their own stories, games and animations, Scratch is intended to help young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively, and learn essential skills for life in the 21st century  while improving academic performance.
 Scratch for kids is a learning experience that is fun and exciting. Therefore, this helps them get over their fear of science and technology. 
 A program like scratch can give students a place where they can have fun as they learn in the process,creating projects that express their ideas.
With scratch students learn,  programming,Demonstrate learning,Understand math applications and  Boost critical thinking.
The ability to code computer programs is an important part of literacy in today's society. When people learn to code in Scratch, they learn important fundamental concepts of programming. 
In addition of learning coding, computer programming also plays an important role in gaining the students' skills such as problem solving, cooperative learning.

Many choose online courses to learn programming nowadays such as courses offered by skooqs for kids ages between, 5 to 18, with scratch courses that fun enjoyable and teach student the basics and core fundamentals of programming, teaching them to  build scratch games such as, a  balloon popping game,creating a save the shark game, to name a few.
16/07/22, 18:33 - Keith EWYL21E0037: Hardwork, determination and believing in one's self.
Making it big requires you to start somewhere no matter how trivial it seems as though nothing good will come out of it or when it becomes hard and unbearable the right mindset is the key to success,  and never quit.
16/07/22, 18:34 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

24/07/22, 21:22 - Keith EWYL21E0037: 1).  Technology Skills.                     Technology skills refer to your ability to interact and complete tasks using computer-based technologies and other associated technologies. These tasks can either be digital or physical.

Sometimes, these skills may be referred to as technical skills. They usually fall under the category of hard skills. That means they are usually learned in a classroom setting or through alternative training.                                
 Some computer skils include      

1)Computer literacy skills. At the very least, you should have some basic computer technology skills to get by in a digital world even if you graduated with an arts degree.

You should know how to switch on and off the computer, how to troubleshoot simple issues such as internet connection problems, and how to install work software 

2)  Database management skills. The management and storage of data is an important aspect of technology. People need to be able to refer to stored data and information if the need arises. If you have these kinds of skills, you can become a database developer or administrator.

Some database skills are dependent on the platforms that are used in the creation of the databases. Others are dependent on the platforms that are in use. Such platforms include MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle.
 
3)Digital marketing skills. Digital marketing is internet-based marketing. It is a technical skill that requires you to master how to communicate with your target audience across multiple technological devices and online platforms

4)Project management skills. Project management is the application of tools and strategies to ensure that teams achieve project goals on time. Project management jobs tend to require both technical and soft skills.

Most of these skills can be acquired through experience, that is actually using the different forms of technology available and luckily today we have websites and programs that gi

24/07/22, 22:03 - Keith EWYL21E0037: 3)computer skills children should learn.

1. Typing Skills
When we think of essential computer skills for our children, typing isn’t something that is often discussed. But that really shouldn’t be the case, as learning to type is one of the most valuable skills that a child should learn.
It can not only help them with their school work but can also set them up with an advantage in later life when it comes to exploring job opportunities. Many jobs now require quick typing skills, but with advances in technology that’s set to become even more important.

2. Using Web Browsers
Web browsers are as important as the first printing presses because they make it possible for anyone to share and interact with knowledge and data. No matter which web browser kids use, they should learn the basics of browsing the Web. Here are the important concepts that all children should know about the web browsers:

URLs and Address Bar. 
Links. 
Navigation Buttons. 
Tabbed Browsing

3. Working With Microsoft Office
Microsoft Office is the most widely used tool for sharing\/presenting professional information by a considerable number of companies in the world. The benefits of Microsoft Office to business productivity is so important that all computer-based professionals today are very familiar with Office. It is used at home, schools and offices daily for organizing, handling and presenting data and information and offers programs that can be used both in a web browser and on a desktop.

4. File Maintenance and Organization
Technology puts the “virtual” in “virtual school,” making the computer your student’s most important learning tool. In fact, a computer can be considered a learning space, just like the virtual classroom. Knowing how to create and save work on a computer is essential, but very quickly the prolific computer user will realize they need a system for how and where they store their work. 

5)6. Using Internet for Research

24/07/22, 22:03 - Keith EWYL21E0037: 4)My views on the importance of digital literacy.

With how fast technology has advanced and how widely it’s spreading, it should come as no surprise that computers now play a huge role in our everyday lives. From the smartphones we use to contact friends to the tablets we bring around to manage files, many of us are dependent (at varying lengths) on technology.
People need to be able to understand the technology that they use so they can use it safely and effectively. Digital literacy is not just about knowing how to take a selfie or update facebook. Digital literacy means understanding technology and using it appropriately.
It is also important they know that not everything they find online is correct. Fake news and information is everywhere so when using information found on the internet it really needs to be evaluated to be assured that it is real.
I feel it is important for people to know the following under digital literacy.
Share with Care (Be Internet Smart)
Don’t Fall for Fake (Be Internet Alert)
Secure Your Secrets (Be Internet Strong)
When in Doubt, Talk It Out, ask for advice (Be Internet Brave)

Google offers internet literacy courses, titled, be internet smart.

Skooqs also offers digital literacy skills, that range from basic computer skills,  gradually increasing in difficulty and knowledge based on age.
24/07/22, 22:11 - Keith EWYL21E0037: 5) Importance of digital literacy.

Digital literacy is essentially the ability to understand and make use of digital technologies. In the modern world, this is increasingly important, as the Internet and digital technology is slowly becoming an essential component of many people’s lives. As time goes on, more and more people are getting online, and utilizing these technologies in their everyday lives, whether for work, or in the home.

1. Make connections
Making connection with friends, family, colleagues, or simply meeting more people is often the reason many people ‘get online’ in the first place. Many people begin simply by setting up an email account, but it goes much further than that. Getting social media accounts like Facebook or Instagram help many people keep up-to-date with the people in their life, or reconnect with those they haven’t spoken to in years. You can also sign up for a free video calling service like Skype to see and talk to your loved ones when you are separated by great distances.

2. Save time and money
Everyone loves saving money, and when you realize how much time you can save on simple daily tasks like shopping, banking, and general errands, you’ll want to get online quick! Online shopping is one of the best ways that digital literacy makes your life more efficient, as buying items from websites like eBay or Amazon can save you thousands of dollars on retail over time, and save you hours of driving and shopping, as the items are delivered right to your door.

3. Increased safety
When used effectively, becoming digitally literate and understanding good online safety practices can help to increase your safety. There and many ways you can protect your passwords, personal information, appear anonymously, and do more to protect your safety. In addition, if you read the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy of a website, you can easily determine what they do to protect your information, and what action will be taken 
24/07/22, 22:21 - Keith EWYL21E0037: 6)how to learn programming language in scratch.

Scratch is a free block-based coding platform that allows you to create your own games, stories, and animations. On Scratch, you can program many different types of projects, such as a Magic Pen, Wizard Tag Game, Geometry Dash, Basketball Game, Pacman, or Snake. Scratch is designed for students age 8-16, but can be used by everyone.

Scratch CODE is an online studio where anyone can add any project they made with Scratch. You're also able to explore projects shared by other kids, and can even comment on them. Another great place to show off your projects once they're complete is our kids coding projects page.

Follow the following steps to learn scratch programming. 

1. Start a new project
To code in Scratch, first open the page on Scratch at MIT. Next, click on the “create” button to make a new project.

2. Drag the code blocks
The code blocks are on the left hand side of the screen. To code, click and drag the blocks to the large center space. On scratch, the characters and objects are called “sprites.” You can add or delete as many sprites as you want. Each time you add a sprite, it will appear on the stage.

3. Click on sprites to code for them
Click on each sprite to code for that particular sprite. There are hundreds of fun sprites to choose from. Whether it’s a soccer player, a butterfly, or a ballerina. 
To code, you can drag blocks of code from the left hand side and connect them together. Each sprite, as well as the background, will have its own code.

These blocks can make sprites move, make sounds, and change color. And when connected together form a series of actions to build your games, animations, and other projects.


Events blocks in Scratch
These yellow colored blocks have a special shape, with the bump at the top. These blocks are “starting blocks,” meaning they must go at the top of any chunk of code we create. They tell us when the code will be run.\

What l learnt for the lesson is,
As things are in life, we must be care and weary of how we approach every situation we are faced with, instead of playing the blame game and trying to pass on blame to, for instance, blaming the economy or the government or the weather or your friends or your parents, by constantly doing this we unconsciously surrender the power over our lives, and as such we don't put any effort in what we do, because we convince ourself it's out of my control and as such we inturn become lazy and idle. Instead we should take responsibility for our actions and choices own up to our mistakes, accept them and learn from them and not let them define who we are.

25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

25/07/22, 16:49 - Keith EWYL21E0037: The Growth mindset of successful people,

Successful people believe in the power of knowledge and learning,  they use their knowledge and skills to better themselves, exploiting every single resource they have at their disposal.
Successful people also believe in taking accountability for their actions, they do not make excuses for their failures neither do they let them determine their lives, they also practice letting money work for them and not working for money, a mindset that compels them not to be driven by money but instead by results. They also set goals and milestones for themselves so as to track their progress.

I believe the best way to effectively adopt the same mindset l must put it into practice not just talk about it, if it means to own up to my mistakes, accepting where l go wrong and learn from it. Also l Should seek knowledge and experience first as those things  monetize for the rest of my life, whereas money spends once.
Teaching myself through focusing on my goals, knowing that looking for someone or something to blame for my own failures only slows my progress, by avoiding responsibility, l evidently avoid personal growth.
As such avoiding the blame game and excuses is key for success, and through personal determination and looking at the bigger picture not focuses on my current state, but focusing on the version of myself who has passed all his limits and has mastered the art of self development and chasing it.

27/07/22, 21:19 - Keith EWYL21E0037: 1) Programming languages a Teenager should Learn.

Programming is a great skill for any one to learn and develop.

1. Python
Python is a programming language that reads like normal speech. One rarely has to add comments to the code because Python code  is written well enough, reads as if the comments are already included in the code. If your kids or students are going to learn something like coding, then you would want them to get a basic grasp on how to think like a programmer. With Python, students will have very few obstacles with regards to learning how to program. They will be able to learn how to construct programming ideas within their heads and then focus on transferring these ideas into instructions that the machine can interpret. 

2. Ruby
Ruby has the most readable syntax for beginner programmers. Instead of spending a lot of time explaining the code that students are typing into machines, a lot of it will be self-explanatory for them. This is a really important factor who. At the end of the day, programming will help them to learn the concepts in order to write good scripts. Ruby is a very robust language and it was originally used to create Twitter, so you can immediately show students that the application is a tool that gets used in popular platforms.

3. Java
Java is arguably a bit harder to learn than either Ruby or Python, but choosing Java as a first-time programming language will make learning any subsequent language a bit easier for students. Many students have already thought about creating their own apps or websites but simply don’t know where to start.
There are a few initial hurdles to overcome, such as installing JDK and understanding how the syntaxes work, but the object oriented setup of the programming language makes it easy for students to progress. Java looks similar to C and C++, but offers more functionalities, thereby enables students to create more robust programs. 

4. Scratch

27/07/22, 21:19 - Keith EWYL21E0037: 2) The best programming languages for a teenager to learn are.


1) Java
Well-known as the official language for developing apps for the Android platform, Java is an objective-oriented and easy-to-handle programming language and the app developers using this app development technology have many open source libraries to choose from.

For kids, the biggest motivation to learn the Java programming language is learning how to build on Minecraft. Ever since it was released in 2011, the game has been on the minds of many kids across the globe. This interest of kids in Minecraft can be used to teach them how to use logic in Java, and solve several problems using the programming language.

2) C++
Considered as the foundation for most programming languages, C++ is equipped with the capabilities to develop enterprising apps. Using a compiler-based approach, which is a simple and yet effective approach to app development, C++ can help to develop apps on multiple platforms, thanks to its versatility.

3) Python 
One of the easiest coding languages to learn, Python requires only a few lines of code to become operational. This means that it is relatively easy even for beginners, such as kids, to learn how to create programs or applications using Python.

Used in highly-advanced fields such as Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity, Python is an incredibly versatile programming language and can be used to create numeric and scientific computing projects, web frameworks, and video games.

4) JavaScript
A procedural and object-oriented programming language, JavaScript is native on all web browsers. Additionally, it is used for client-facing or front-end applications. This means that the computer of the user is where the JavaScript actions are executed.

Kids who master this programming language will be able to transform simple documents on the web into user-friendly games and applications. This programming language is best for kids who already have s
27/07/22, 21:19 - Keith EWYL21E0037: 3) Programming language to start with as a Teenager.

Depending on what an individual plans on doing,

1)For game devopment
Java is often used for Android and iOS app development, as it’s the basis of the Android operating system, which makes it one of the best choices if you want to build mobile apps.
While it may not be as easy to pick up as Python, Java is a high-level language, and so it’s still relatively beginner-friendly. However, it has a slow startup and will take beginners much longer to deploy their first project.

2)For web development
Along with html and css you can also learn JavaScript. 

websites that you use every day rely on JavaScript including Twitter, Gmail, Spotify, Facebook, and Instagram according to General Assembly.

Additionally, it’s a must-have when adding interactivity to websites because it communicates with HTML and CSS. This makes it essential for front-end development and consumer-facing websites while becoming increasingly important in back-end development and growing in demand all the time. 


3) for a more diverse programming language that encompasses, the general Graphical user interfaces, web development and a bit of game development, 
Python is always recommended if you’re looking for an easy and even fun programming language to learn first. Rather than having to jump into strict syntax rules, Python reads like English and is simple to understand for someone who’s new to programming. This allows you to obtain a basic knowledge of coding practices without having to obsess over smaller details that are often important in other languages.

Python also is ideal for web development, graphic user interfaces (GUIs), and software development. In fact, it was used to build Instagram, YouTube, and Spotify, so it’s clearly in demand among employers in addition to having a faster onboarding.

1)Adobe Get Started

If you feel like the cost of Photoshop itself is all you want to avoid, why not try one of the free tutorials out there, Adobe's own instructional database of lessons.

The Get Started course explains the interface and layout of Photoshop, how to change the size of images, work with layers, and even improve the quality of your photos and pictures.

It also has tutorials if you want to edit photos, learn website and graphic design, or understand the wonders of layer masking. If you prefer to learn while working on your own project, there are courses designed specifically around a final goal to make it easier to learn as you create.

Should you feel like you're a bit beyond the basics, there are more advanced courses you can do, too, including ones that teach you how to integrate your Photoshop projects with other Adobe applications.

2)Essentials Training Course
SkillShare

SkillShare is a popular platform for people wanting to learn a variety of subjects, with Photoshop among them.

As one of the most popular Photoshop courses on SkillShare, Scott's class is comprehensive and starts with the basics.

You don't have to start from the beginning if you already have some Photoshop skills. With more than nine hours of tutorials, you're bound to learn plenty. For example, expect to learn how to manipulate existing images, create your own graphics, and combine them to make an exciting work of your own.

If you need any examples along the way or a good starting point, there are exercises and completed files to use as a guide
27/07/22, 21:19 - Keith EWYL21E0037: 5) How is game development as a career,

Game development is challenging. Games take months to years to develop, so games, in reality, take thousands of individual work hours, not even combined development hours. That goes for the good as much as the bad ones. Somebody spent thousands of hours making the games you hate, and someone also spent as much if not more time making the games that you love as well.

Game development as a career can be:

Competitive

More people want to work in video game development than jobs available. You have to be a really capable candidate to get a good job.

Unstable

The average game developer has four jobs in five years. Too frequently, companies go out of business, or teams are laid off as soon as their projects are completed.

Stressful

There are deadlines to meet, and the more critical the deadline, the more likely problems preventing you from meeting it arise.

Exhausting

Sixty-five work-weeks are not uncommon in this field; as deadlines approach, the hours can be even longer and longer.

Imbalanced

As in work-life balance, it’s getting better, but it still can be hard maintaining a family life.

Fairly-well paying

The average game developer’s salary in 2021 was $101,644\/yr. Artists earned $$65,000\/yr, designers $74,000\/yr, audio professionals $$150,000K. That’s only when they were employed and earning a salary, of course.

Fulfilling

But only if you have an extreme passion for game development, don’t expect to have creative control over your project, and equally enjoy working on your own and as part of a team.

Game developers’ careers can be very successful if you come up with awesome ideas that people immediately fall in love with, find addictive and relatable or fantasy.

29/07/22, 03:34 - Keith EWYL21E0037: 2) What is scratch and is it easy for kids to learn

Learning coding for kids is not only beneficial towards future career prep, but also for building strong logical and creative thinking skills.

Scratch is a visual programming language created by the MIT Media Lab in 2007. Its drag-and-drop interface with colorful blocks makes it one of the most intuitive programming languages to learn. Unlike traditional programming languages like Python where the coder must write out the code, Scratch empowers young people and adults alike to easily build interactive games and programs by connecting code blocks together.

Scratch is typically recommended for children over the age of 8. For kids ages 5-7, ScratchJr is an alternative option with an even simpler and more intuitive platform than regular Scratch.

Scratch is an introductory coding language for kids and adults of all ages.
Even though Scratch is great for kids 8-11, older kids and adults can use Scratch, too! Anyone with minimal computer science experience will find Scratch to be an accessible and friendly introduction to coding. In fact, many colleges such  even use Scratch and other similar block-based languages as part of their introductory computer science courses!

29/07/22, 03:34 - Keith EWYL21E0037: 4) Is a visual programming language like scratch a good way for children to learn to code.

While Scratch may not look like it at first glance, it's still definitely a real programming language. In fact, as of May 2020, Scratch ranked as the 19th most popular computer programming language in the world! At the same time, Scratch definitely differs greatly from the other programming languages on that list.

Scratch blocks connected together in a project.
The majority of the world’s most popular coding languages are \"text-based,” meaning that code is written by typing words and symbols with your keyboard. To create a program in text-based languages like Python, Java, and C++, you must string together multiple lines of code written by hand. While this method of programming is efficient and powerful, it can be difficult to learn for the first time — just like picking up a foreign language.

Lines of text-based code script
An example of text-based code.
Just as human languages each have their own unique grammar and vocabulary, text-based coding languages have special ways to write different commands (instructions telling the computer what to do), as well as their own tricky syntax. This learning curve can often be discouraging for young new coders.

In contrast, Scratch is a block-based, visual programming language. Unlike traditional written commands typed using symbols on the keyboard, Scratch commands take the form of colorful blocks. Users can create programs by snapping blocks together, much like virtual LEGO! They can then click the green flag button in the Scratch interface to run them.

Scratch is a visual programming language created by the MIT Media Lab in 2007. Its drag-and-drop interface with colorful blocks makes it one of the most intuitive programming languages to learn.
