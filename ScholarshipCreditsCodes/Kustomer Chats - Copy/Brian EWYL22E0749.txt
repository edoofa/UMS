02/11/22, 19:20 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride.

Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

How did your weekend go?

This weekend's activity gave you a first-hand experience to fit yourselves in a small part of the leadership shoes. I wanted you to create a newsletter of your own. Similar to the ones you have enjoyed reading every Sunday from the founder's office.

In our session, we will discuss:
1) the newsletter that you have designed for the weekend activity
07/11/22, 22:00 - Brian EWYL22E0749: Noted  with thanks

How is your day going?
09/11/22, 22:00 - Saloni Rastogi: The newsletter is amazing Brian and I am pretty happy with the presentation that you have made, I feel so happy ✨ 
I have shared the newsletter with Ms. Deepali personally, let's see if it is a probable newsletter to get featured in the week.
09/11/22, 22:01 - Saloni Rastogi: I have a suggestion for the community building project
09/11/22, 22:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Some of my students have formed a WhatsApp group where they:
First, keep sharing the link of the group in their family groups, class groups, and school groups, with the children who stay nearby, and, try to circulate all around.
Second, once new people get added to the group, they are told about Edoofa and it the perks of being associated with it.
third, they share the community building form with them and then children fill the form and share it on the group.

What do you think about this?
09/11/22, 22:01 - Brian EWYL22E0749: I am doing good and my day is going well and yourself?
09/11/22, 22:04 - Brian EWYL22E0749: It is actually a good way to me to tell people about Edoofa

Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their personality traits made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.

How are you?

The Wednesday lesson taught us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, _disability_. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition.

In our session, we will discuss:
1) your understanding of how disability is different from what we thought about it earlier
2) progress on the projects
17/11/22, 21:16 - Saloni Rastogi: I received a golden badge on the personality test.
I am so happy that you received a green one, there is so much more to learn and inculcate I feel in us.

19/12/22, 02:12 - Brian EWYL22E0749: It is actually hard enough to find the perfect gift for my best friend, mother and my father I literally see every single day. I will reach for the classic Christmas people-pleaser that is my friend and my parents a gift card. While cash is great, my holiday giftee would definitely appreciate receiving one of these Secret Santa gift ideas even more as it shows me spent time thinking about what they love and want.

To solve the question of what I will get my Secret Santa recipient, I have
curated a list of gifts that are truly universally adored and are guaranteed to be actually useful and will arrive before the holiday festivities kick off. Think hot chocolate mugs, colorful Airpod cases, skincare sets, claw clip packs, novelty socks, and candy. I will also be giving my  Secret Santa partners a gift that is easy to rewrap and regift to a loved one if they needed to.

I have rounded up all the most affordable mini gifts that my friends and family will love.  Trust and promise —there's a gift on this list for my friend, my mother and my father. These people would be my secret santa because I really love them and there's a strong connection between us as I see them every single day. I say to Edoofians and all the Edoofa team Happy shopping, Santa!
