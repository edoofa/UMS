25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

27/07/22, 21:51 - Unknown: Now I am sharing with you the last weekend activity.
27/07/22, 21:51 - Unknown: This week, we discovered that people who are successful don't hold the world responsible for their failures. They accept accountability for their own choices and results. To develop this mindset of taking responsibility for everything and avoiding the blame game takes time and focus. As your Saturday Assignment your are required to write a short write up, on the growth mindset of successful people and how will you make sure you develop the same mindset. The word limit for this assignment is 150-200 words. \u2028\u2028Kindly make sure you follow the word limit strictly, any responses less than the minimum word limit will not be marked. 
You are required to submit the same by Monday on the dedicated EWYL line 

Happy learning !
27/07/22, 22:18 - MASIKA EWYL21E0669: Thank you
27/07/22, 22:19 - MASIKA EWYL21E0669: Do you mind sharing the EWYL line

29/07/22, 00:25 - Unknown: hello masika! how are you doing?
29/07/22, 00:26 - Unknown: Masika, did you work on the week's Wednesday wisdom shared with you yesterday?

I personally found it very interesting as I know my students struggle with managing their time to attend university and to work on their skill building and that is why I requested Mrs Davi to create a lesson on the same.
29/07/22, 00:48 - MASIKA EWYL21E0669: Yes
29/07/22, 00:48 - MASIKA EWYL21E0669: I already did it
29/07/22, 01:08 - Unknown: great
29/07/22, 01:08 - Unknown: Please share with me what you have learnt from the wednesday wisdom Masika.
29/07/22, 01:18 - MASIKA EWYL21E0669: Successful people tend to have their own Affirmations.They set goals and are bound to achieve them.Same should apply to us where we should set goals that won't allow us to rest but work to achieve them hence a growth mindset which creates a difference between failure and success.
  Risk taking.Most successful people are risk takers.It is unfortunate that most of us want to be seen as smart so we usually do things that we are good at but risk takers are willing to do different risky things like bringing up different ideas that they think could bring change to some areas hence creativity that has led to their development. We usually don't know where our luck lays hence taking risks as been challenging today most people but has also changed lives of many and for that we have to have the spirit of taking risks
  Consistency.Successful people know that that failure is not a negative vibe but rather a platform to learn and also review their decision making hence they persist on what they are doing until it is achieved hence we should consider persisting on our goals so as to achieve.
  Optimism. Having it in mind that success belongs to you is a mindset for the successful people. Turn on the volume up on the big me which everyone should have so as to set up the environment for success. Believing that you will be successful plays a big role to your success journey.
  Self awareness and patience is also an aspect for the successful. What you are at times is not important but knowing what you want to become is essential.Successful people are patient,at times it not that everything Will work out the way you want they to be but one has got to be patient and gives time to somethings though this should not dismiss the aspect of time management as it is said that the earlier the better.
29/07/22, 01:19 - Unknown: Amazing to read your activity response, i am proud to see that you are able to understand complex concepts now. How do you plan to implement in your day to day life?
29/07/22, 01:19 - Unknown: Also Masika, i shared the Wednesday wisdom with you yesterday on your EWYL group as well. Did you check?
29/07/22, 01:20 - MASIKA EWYL21E0669: I didn't receive it
29/07/22, 01:21 - MASIKA EWYL21E0669: Implement what
29/07/22, 01:50 - Unknown: Let me share it on the EWYL group again Masika. Please check it.
29/07/22, 04:47 - MASIKA EWYL21E0669: Okay
29/07/22, 19:56 - Unknown: Hello Edoofian, how are you doing?

Please send the \"Proud Edoofian\" chant for the day.
30/07/22, 19:42 - MASIKA EWYL21E0669: Am a proud edoofian
30/07/22, 19:43 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

05/08/22, 18:12 - MASIKA EWYL21E0669: I learned that entrepreneurship is not a straight road .it is a journey where many discouragements will come our way but you have to persist on your dreams despite that.
 I have also learned that success is not all about how old you are or who you are.you can still achieve your dreams given the age just like Gilbert started at 19 .
 I have learned to grab every opportunity that comes my way just like Gilbert took advantage of the NGO that had introduced a computer literacy program in Highfields which became like a starting point.
  I have learned that when an idea is still at birth ,not many will see it the Way to do,but you have to believe in yourself.
 I have learned that surrounding yourself with positive people is the way to go.
 I have learned to advance my passion just like Gilbert had interest in Arts and design that has led to his success

05/08/22, 20:15 - Unknown: Good to read your understanding of the lesson Edoofian. The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years. The price is knowing that time is working on your side even when the results don’t show it.
05/08/22, 20:15 - Unknown: Masika, you can mention it as India.

11/08/22, 10:37 - MASIKA EWYL21E0669: He is optimistic.He had the belief that he will make it  as learnt from him that when an idea is still at birth, not many will see it the way you do but you have to believe in yourself this proves that Gilbert was aware of the discouragements that he was going to face but that did not stop him from doing his thing hence his success
 Gilbert was hardworking.Given that at some point it all started as an internship is amusing.The way he work with his assistants on the satellites portrays Gilbert as a hardworking man
   Gilbert is also opportunistic.He is man willing to take advantage of every opportunity that comes his way, just like he took advantage of the computer literacy program by an NGO as a starting point of his career

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

12/08/22, 10:30 - MASIKA EWYL21E0669: It is true that most of us dream about success,we keep wishing that we become successful people but we have failed to move towards success through hard work.
We have to get ourselves to moving towards success rather than sit and wait for it to come to us.
 Most of the times, our failures tend to make us loose hope leaving us pessimistic yet they are supposed to be our stepping stones to other levels.we should take advantage of our failures to enable us make better decisions and we should stay consistent on them.
  Being inspired is important for it keeps us on track.It drives us to working hard to become who we want to become.
