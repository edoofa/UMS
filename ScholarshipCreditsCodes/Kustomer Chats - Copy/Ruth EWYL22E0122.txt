It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We will be receiving two students in LPU today but as for their first day, they are not aware of where is which room and hostel.
So I want to ask you if you can drop those two students (both of them are girls ) to GH5.
Their names are Sibonginkosi and Natalie.
They will be coming around 08:30-09:30 PM IST.
05/08/22, 22:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Please let me know as soon as possible.
05/08/22, 22:08 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: Alright l'll be there. Will they be dropped at Gh5 gate?

I hope that is okay for you?
05/08/22, 22:39 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: We're not allowed to leave the hostel after 7:30pm. 
What they can do is after being dropped they can use an Erickshaw to transport them from the main gate to GH5. I'll be waiting for them at the GH5 entrance. Then l'll assist them from there
06/08/22, 02:38 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: Natalie and Sibonginkosi have arrived safely

Gilbert had a humble beginning when he was installing satellites which made him a hard worker. He is goal orientated, he always wanted to own one of the biggest media companies in Zimbabwe and he achieved it by trusting and believing in himself.
He is a selfless man, he appreciates and highlights other people's skills. He employed other people to help him with the installation business.   
He is passionate about what he does and aims higher. After successfully installing over 2000 satellites, he didn't end there or decided to a full time satellite installer, instead he opened his own company. 
Gilbert was observant and selective on who he partnered with or hired. Although he encountered problems during his business journey, he did not let it drag him down, instead he learnt from it and applied it in his future decisions. 
Gilbert was eager to learn. He started his company from his self acquired knowledge and went on to get degrees in his area of specialty in order to better his business.

09/08/22, 21:12 - Saloni Rastogi: One can be called successful if they have achieved their desired goals. For some people, being successful means being rich. But being successful is even more than being rich. When you achieve what you want, it gives you immense pleasure, and that is incomparable with being rich. To be successful in any aspect of life, one needs to have strong dedication and work hard. 
Our *WEEKEND ACTIVITY* discussed the traits of a successful person.
So, in our session today:
1. discuss your understanding of the weekend activity.

You have to believe and have faith that you can do. You can start by something small that'll contribute to your journey of success. You have to choose friends or patners carefully as being with the wrong person can have a big impact in your business or future.  It encouraged to strive for the best and to take risks

12/08/22, 21:51 - Saloni Rastogi: Everyone aspires for success but have you ever felt that it comes easier to some than to others? Perhaps it's time for a new perspective!
There were 3 mantras that Ms. Davi explored in her weekly WEDNESDAY Wisdom.
So in our session today, we would:
1. discuss your outlook on the lesson, and what you feel about it.
2. pending understanding of the weekend activity
2. Choose a project of your choice and work on it in this month.
12/08/22, 21:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Since our session began late, we can have our session till 5:30 PM, just for today.
12/08/22, 21:53 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your response RUTH and I must say that like always your understanding has blown my mind and added so much to my knowledge that I can't express.
All I can say is that:
*Success* is a strong word with a deep meaning, which might vary from one person to another. To attain success or your life’s objective, you must work tirelessly. Your success determines the _type of person you must be and the lifestyle you must keep_. There is no worth and no achievement if a person has dreams but does nothing to pursue them. A person can achieve success if they are committed to their objectives and dare to confront any challenges that come on their way to success. For some, success entails a large sum of money. However, the accurate measure of success is realizing your dream and attaining your objective. A person who aspires to be a doctor can only accomplish it if he puts in the necessary effort and works hard. If only he knew which road to take and how to get started on it. There is no such thing as a quick fix for success. You must pursue the route of honesty, truthfulness, and strenuous effort to be successful. The road to success is never easy, and there are no shortcuts. *Finding a solution to any problem may take time and a lot of effort, but there is always a solution; we only need to seek in the proper direction. A person must overcome all of the obstacles while remaining strong enough to proceed along the path. *If you give up on the struggles, then you can never achieve your dreams.*
12/08/22, 21:56 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this I want to inform you that from this month onwards, actually from this week, I and Ms. Davi, both were planning to award someone with 'BEST RESPONSE OF THE LESSON\/ACTIVITY'.
I specially recommended your name to her because I feel your understanding and outlook on these activities and lessons can change my mind, then it will definitely inspire others to change and change for good.
What do you think about it?
Do you think your response is good enough to bring you this title?

Keep working hard RUTH for the Wednesday lesson response.

13/08/22, 15:38 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

From now on all our sessions will take place from here.
20/07/22, 01:11 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: Alright at the same time right?
20/07/22, 01:35 - Saloni Rastogi: Ruth since you are so excited about this journey, why not I share with you last weekend's activity and then you share your response with me here. I hope you are excited to know about the activity!!
20/07/22, 01:48 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: Yes you can share them
20/07/22, 02:10 - Saloni Rastogi: It's that time of the week when you are required to wear your thinking caps and get your tools ready to research and learn! From our Wednesday Wisdom, we learned how Patrice Motsepe, became successful by making the best of the opportunity very few could see, the strong potential in the mining industry. As part of your Saturday Activity, you are required to share a detailed submission on the fast-growing industry\/sector\/business in your country. Don’t forget to add a SWOT analysis and predictions on the future performance of the same.
20/07/22, 02:19 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: Alright. When is the research supposed to be submitted
20/07/22, 15:24 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: Good morning Ms Saloni
20/07/22, 15:24 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: I'm a proud EDOOFIAN!

20/07/22, 15:37 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day Ruth!
How did your day go?
20/07/22, 15:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Ruth I saw you have typed 3 which means you don't know what makes you a proud edoofian.
20/07/22, 15:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- *“I am a proud Edoofian”*
20/07/22, 15:39 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
20/07/22, 15:40 - Saloni Rastogi: As to your response submission,please submit it by 1 PM today.
20/07/22, 15:50 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: Good morning Ms Saloni. My day was fantastic and yours?
20/07/22, 15:51 - Saloni Rastogi: My day also went well, thanks for asking Ruth.
20/07/22, 15:51 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: Indeed I'm proud to say \" l'm a proud EDOOFIAN\"
20/07/22, 15:51 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: Alright
20/07/22, 15:53 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride.

20/07/22, 20:05 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: The fast- growing industry in Zimbabwe is mining.
 Zimbabwe's mining industry is focused on diverse range of small- medium mining operations. The mining sector contributes about 16% of National Gross Domestic Product. The mineral exports account for about 60% of Zimbabwe's export earnings. 
The mining sector is highly diversified with about 40 different minerals. The main products are gold, platinum, chrome, coal, diamonds and lithium. Zimbabwe holds the world's largest- known deposits of lithium ( approx 11 Million tonnes).. It also has the 2nd largest platinum deposits ( 2.8 Billion tonnes) and High grade chromium ores ( 10 Billion tonnes) in the world. Gold is the primary export now. 63% of the recorded gold production is from Artisanal and small scale mining. Zimbabwe has small scale gold deposits because it's under- explored. Gold mining has the highest number of syndicates operating illegally.
Challenges faced in the mining sector is access and allocation of capital. Rocketing exploration and production cost has impacted profit margins and left investors reticent to engage with new projects. There's fewer high quality ore deposits left to develop as new deposits exist in remote and very difficult to access areas.
The industry can be improved by reusing mining waste, using eco-friendly equipment, lower-impact mining techniques, rehabilitating mining sites and shutting down illegal mining.
Swot analysis states that Platinum mining boom will revive Zimbabwe's economy.  Zimbabwe is home to the world's 3rd platinum -group metals deposits and has announced 2.79 million ounces in output by 2024.
The Ministry of Mines and Mining Development promotes sustainable exploration, mining, processing, marketing and management of mineral resources for the benefit of all the Zimbabweans. It makes a commitment to provide a service to the specified quality standards and within stated limits

20/07/22, 20:18 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: Alright thank you
20/07/22, 20:52 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your response to your weekend activity and it made me so inquisitive to know about the mining industry I got to know that predominant minerals mined by the industry include platinum, chrome, gold, coal, and diamonds. The country boasts the second-largest platinum deposit and high-grade chromium ores in the world, with approximately 2.8 billion tons of platinum group metals and 10 billion tons of chromium ore.
Your response is so elaborative and impressive and it provided me with so much knowledge.
20/07/22, 20:54 - Saloni Rastogi: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader. 
Also Ruth, along with the SWOT analysis of a company, I would appreciate it if you also share a SWOT analysis of yourself. I want to see how much more you have learned beyond this activity.
22/07/22, 01:46 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: Good morning Ms Saloni

23/07/22, 01:41 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day Ruth!
How's your day going?
23/07/22, 01:45 - Saloni Rastogi: I am so happy that you have presented a SWOT of yourself and I am glad that you have identified your weaknesses as well very well.
Since you said you have difficulty in time management, for that I would say to you that:
- Make a list
To-do lists are a good way to stay organized. \"Try it and see what works best for you,\".
- Focus on results
Good time management at work means doing high-quality work, not high quantity. E
- Prioritise important tasks
Tasks can be grouped into 4 categories:

urgent and important
not urgent but important
urgent but not important
neither urgent nor important
23/07/22, 01:47 - Saloni Rastogi: For public speaking, I would like to say:
- Nervousness Is Normal. Practice and Prepare!
All people feel some physiological reactions like pounding hearts and trembling hands. Do not associate these feelings with the sense that you will perform poorly or make a fool of yourself. Some nerves are good. 
- Know Your Audience. Your Speech Is About Them, Not You.
Before you begin to craft your message, consider who the message is intended for. Learn as much about your listeners as you can. This will help you determine your choice of words, level of information, organization pattern, and motivational statement.
23/07/22, 01:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, let's move on with our session.
Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our WEDNESDAY Wisdom was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
23/07/22, 05:55 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: Good day Ms Saloni. Thank you for the advices. l'll surely try it

24/07/22, 19:15 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: It was about the SWOT analysis. The swot analysis is important in a business because it shows the progress of the business and highlights where it's lagging. A personal SWOT analysis helps you to go back to the drawing board and work on yourself.
25/07/22, 03:18 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

27/07/22, 05:20 - Saloni Rastogi: So how is the experience going?
27/07/22, 05:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, we can have our missed session tomorrow:
''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''

The weekend activity clearly talked about what are the growing mindsets of successful people. 
I would really appreciate it if you share your understanding with me on the same and what you think can take you to the top.
27/07/22, 05:39 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: Taking responsibility, looking back and assess where you are, what is hindering your progress and what you should do to improve it. 
I need to prioritize impact Tasks, practice inorder to be perfect
27/07/22, 17:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Ruth!
How are your mornings going at LPU?
27/07/22, 17:26 - Saloni Rastogi: Did you meet Mr. Rithvik and are you facing any challenges?
I will help you with the same, please let me know.
27/07/22, 17:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, I read your understanding of the activity and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it’s not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you’re looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don’t do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.

29/07/22, 17:51 - Ruth EWYL22E0122: I'm staying in girls hostel 5.
My phone is a 3G phone so my Indian line is not reading because it's a 4G. I'll have to buy a new phone then I can provide you with my number
29/07/22, 17:52 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

29/07/22, 19:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, we can have our session for today.
Time management is defined as using your time productively and efficiently—but what about when you are working as productively as possible, and you still can’t get everything done? It may be better to think about time management as a combination of working productively and prioritizing your time.

Our *Wednesday Wisdom* was all about Time Management and understanding the priority matrix to organize our tasks. 
I am really excited to hear your understanding and working on the same.
Please share it with me here.
In today's session we will talk about:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. progress on community building projects.
3. and of course your college life, your new challenges, and how exciting it has become.
