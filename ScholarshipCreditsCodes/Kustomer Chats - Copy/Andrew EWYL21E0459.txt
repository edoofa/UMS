It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

15/07/22, 22:43 - Andrew EWYL21E0459: *Wednesday wisdom*

Patrice Motsepe's success is the important one , highlighting to us how the use of the opportunity at the right time with the right skills is currently creating the gateway to our new future. 

I learnt that , it is very important to use time if you have the chance to do so before the opportunity gone. It is also of paramount significance to subscribe  ourselves  to the law of time, grab every opportunity to the very end and make the best use of it with honour.

 To sum up , I have also learned that , if there's a will , there's a way but we should activate the real passion, through making some sacrifices in order to grab the best of our lives.

Hope you are having one fine day.
16/07/22, 04:15 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your response Andrew and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a WAY. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. We can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.

20/07/22, 22:05 - Andrew EWYL21E0459: *Weekend Assignment*

 *A SWOT ANALYSIS On Agricultural Medical Aid Society.*

 *Agricultural Medical Society*, it's a sector based or industry based medical aid offering health insurance to people in the agricultural industry . Health insurance in Zimbabwe come in form of medical aid .Agricultural medical  aid is a fast growing medical aid which put it's major focus on farmers and farm workers both on small and large scale farming aiming at giving them access to medical attention in times of catastrophy or uncertainty to illness due to injury or non injury illness . Being founded by Grain Marketing Board in Zimbabwe , the major focus or goal to insure wellness to farmer and farm workers so as to promote productivity in the inter agricultural farmer of class of farmers.

However , as far as the company has goals and objectives , Agricultural Medical Aid has also strengths , weakness , opportunities and threats. 

 *Strengths*
Agricultural medical aid has their own strength in providing medical or health insurance in Zimbabwe. The strength which Agricultural Medical Aid have are it's collaborations, marketing strategies and Funding.

 1) Collaboration
Agricultural Medical Aid Society have been collaborated with other companies so to get access to it's target market . They have formed partnership with companies like CBZ, TSF, Econet and Agribank. This companies has given Agricultural Medical Society an edge on selling it's products and services.Most of Agricultural Medical Society customers are located in rural areas . So the society is using these companies to reach both their customers and potential customers . These companies are also allowing the society member to get extra services such as loan for instance , CBZ farmers loans , Agribank farmers loans. Also by becoming an Agricultural Medical Aid member the society is giving their members access to discounts in purchasing Agricultural produce such as seeds, fertilizers and tractors. So the

21/07/22, 21:32 - Andrew EWYL21E0459: *Wednesday wisdom* 

 *Key takeaways*

1)  I have to be careful when it comes to get in touch with others. I must grab a good attitude to consider those who are around me.

2) I have to accept personal responsibility , learn from my mistakes and then take some measures about it. I don't have to blame the world when I fail to achieve something .

3) I must get to work if it's possible for me to achieve those incredible opportunities in my life because things don't just happen dramatically but through working hard . I have to make things happen with an immediate effect because waiting is wasting .

4) I have to stay focused and avoid negative things which might  ruin my life and If I fail in life , I don't have to blame the negative circumstances rather I have to accept responsibility for my destiny . I shouldn't play the losers game either. 

In conclusion , my current failures doesn't determine my final destiny but it is of paramounce for me to take responsibilities in my life
21/07/22, 21:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day Andrew!
How are you doing today?
21/07/22, 21:56 - Saloni Rastogi: I guess there must be a certain glitch that I am not able to see your response to the weekend activity. Don't worry.
I would request you to share your response again with me in the written format (I mean as the text) again here, on the EWYL Line.
21/07/22, 21:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this Andrew, we'll move towards our session.
Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our *WEDNESDAY Wisdom* was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on the community building projects ( I have not received any form from you yet )
3. Weekend activity discussion

22/07/22, 05:14 - Saloni Rastogi: I don't see your response to the weekend activity still Andrew, can you please share on the EWYL group, please?
22/07/22, 05:15 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your response Andrew and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.

23/07/22, 02:07 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your response Andrew and it made me so inquisitive to know more about agriculture in Zimbabwe look what I found in Zimbabwe is overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture. Agriculture accounts for 18% of Zimbabwe's GDP as of 2015. Agriculture enabled people to produce surplus food. There are different crops that farmers grow and some of these include, maize, sorghum, rapoko, groundnuts, round-nuts, and beans.
Your response reflects clarity in the way you have expressed and so thoughtfully you have penned down your thoughts.
23/07/22, 02:07 - Saloni Rastogi: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.

25/07/22, 03:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Yesterday I had an amazing day. I went to the airport to receive all my proud Edoofians and I had tears in my eyes seeing their happiness and enthusiasm. I want you to look at it and share your thoughts with me.

''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''

The weekend activity clearly talked about what are the *growing mindsets of successful people*. 
I would really appreciate it if you share your understanding with me on the same and what you think can take you to the top.
