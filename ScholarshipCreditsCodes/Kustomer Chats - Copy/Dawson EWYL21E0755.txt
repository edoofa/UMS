12/07/22, 23:19 - Dawson EWYL21E0755: I'm alright Sir and how are you doing?
12/07/22, 23:19 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

21/07/22, 22:08 - Dawson EWYL21E0755: Good afternoon Sir, how are you doing?
21/07/22, 22:17 - Dawson EWYL21E0755: I have read the Wednesday  wisdom and have concluded that a person should have personal responsibility and must be willing to work towards a certain goal. As most people look for some
someone or something to pin their blame on when they fail or when things go wrong, it can be concluded that it often becomes a barrier to success, as a result, people do not work their hardest to complete tasks or achieve their goals. 
Successful people, on the other hand,strive for greatness having personal responsibility. They do not seek someone or something to pin their blame on therefore face challenges head on and overcome them for example not being able to complete a task due to lack of internet access. Successful people try to find a way around this problem for example by seeking help from other people to complete the task by use of mobile hotspots or even asking other people to do the task for them.

25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
