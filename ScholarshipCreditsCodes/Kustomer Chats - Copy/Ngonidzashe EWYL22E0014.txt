14/07/22, 13:00 - Ngonidzashe EWYL22E0014: For one to given a task by the edoofa scholarship program these are the qualities I think one must have 

I think one must be pationate and because of one's desire and passion to do the tasks it will be easier to accomplish and that way one will do the task with love and treat it as part of his or her life 
The second point is dedication. I believe one must be dedicated in Every task this will help one to reach any extent so that the task can be fulfilled and it's a good sign of a good participator
Thirdly I think one must be patient . Patience help one do the right thing at the right moment and it makes the task be completed perfectly without any complications and this is another quality one must have 
Fourthly one must be an opportunity taker . Nomatter the challenge one is facing whenever there is an opportunity one must take it and make it to his advantage that's a quality I think is highly required . The other good character is having good communication skills as Edoofians I think we must be good in communication because were there is no good communication there is also disaster and were there is good communication things go well and perfect and in some cases they are easily done . For one to be part of the edoofa program task one must be a faster thinker one must always think outside the box and always must try his best to find a solution to the task given . One must be a risk taker , sometimes the projects requires on to risk and as an Edoofian you must be ready to take risks
15/07/22, 02:24 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings NGONIDZASHE!
How's your day going?
15/07/22, 02:24 - Aditi Kapoor: I am really glad to hear your understanding of the activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY* . They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.

How are you?
15/07/22, 20:16 - Aditi Kapoor: I am doing pretty well, thanks for asking.
15/07/22, 20:17 - Aditi Kapoor: From his dad’s small foray into entrepreneurship, Patrice Motsepe got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe’s success story is a remarkable one showing how curiosity, doggedness, perseverance, and the knack to exploit great opportunities as they come, can determine how successful or not, any individual could become. 
And this was all about our WEDNESDAY WISDOM.
Hope you have gone through it.
I am so excited to listen to your thoughts and views HERE.

One of the many benefits of starting a business or pursuing your passions when one is a bit older is that they bring all of the experience and wisdom to the table.
