06/03/23, 21:07 - Aditi Kapoor: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

13/03/23, 21:27 - Aditi Kapoor: Well the question was: What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals?
13/03/23, 21:32 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E1230: Okay thank you ,sorry I had not received the questions on Saturday ,I had only received the inspirational word
13/03/23, 21:33 - Aditi Kapoor: Oh let me share with you
13/03/23, 21:33 - Aditi Kapoor: The feedback we have received from some of you on this week’s Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.
As part of this week’s Saturday Activity, you are required to share your written submission on : 
What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?
There is no word limit, so feel free to express your understanding in detail. The second answer requires some mental work, so sit with yourself, introspect, and share your honest answer with your mentor. 
Let this activity play an important role in your personal goal setting. We will connect soon in our upcoming session. 
Till then, happy learning and happy growing!
13/03/23, 21:56 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E1230: Thank you
13/03/23, 21:56 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E1230: A North Star Metric is a single key performance indicator that represents the most important goals for a business .
It helps the businesses to stay focused on their goals as it have clear understanding of most important metric such that businesses can make data-driven decisions and use those wise decisions to archieve the business's goals  and also it guides in the running of the business which help them to stay focused on their goals

I think as student a good North Star Metric to guide in academic and personal growth is to set goals for example 
1 . to score higher marks or to attain a distinction everytime and become successful 
2.to be responsible and well-mannered student .So as a student I would know that I have goals to archieve so then ,it will make me to work really hard and maintain good manners so as to attain my goals
13/03/23, 21:59 - Aditi Kapoor: That is wonderful Tafadzwa!!
13/03/23, 21:59 - Aditi Kapoor: I am impressed by your understanding and your goals are brilliant1
