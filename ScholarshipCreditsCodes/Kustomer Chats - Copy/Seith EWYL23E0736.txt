18/12/23, 18:30 - Seith EWYL23E0736: Story *
18/12/23, 19:16 - Seith EWYL23E0736: Hard work and honest 

 In life you can never grow or be someone without hard work . Again for you to be rewarded with anything it starts with honesty. I try to install these qualities when l at a look at my uncle who has thrived and improved our community due to having these qualities.  So my uncle was a poor young man who had nothing but determination and believed in himself . He started hustling as he was unemployed.  He would go out in the morning and come back at night without eating but working hard to get money . He did so for almost 2 years straight as he was saving up cash . He was so honest to himself that the saved money day by day he did not touch it . And then came a time when the money was enough to build a small shop called a tuckshop it was so small but he could sell groceries . Again he started saving again and again even when the money was enough to maybe improve his living conditions he opted to stick with his living conditions as he was saving the little he got from the tuck shop . Years passed and his honesty was rewarded and he built a big supermarket which would make a turn completely in his life . From being unemployed he became an employer and the profit from the supermarket improved his life . Despite the major improvement in his life the principles that got him there still echoed in his head and he didn't stop there saving and working hard and history repeat itself again and again to the point where a poor unemployed young man who had it rough become the owner of 4 big supermarkets. Due to being a humble man who grew up not having anything he set out to improve the community  by building boreholes for easy water accessment  by the locals since water was a problem and his recent act of kindness was putting electricity in the community . So from my uncle's great story you can see that hard work and honest go hand in hand hence if you obtain the two and put them into practise you surely are certain of success .
18/12/23, 20:20 - Aditi Kapoor: I am truly inspired by the incredible story you shared about your uncle's journey. The principles of hard work and honesty that he embodied are truly commendable, and it's heartening to see the positive impact he has had on both his life and the community.
Your uncle's resilience during the challenging early years, where he worked tirelessly without immediate rewards, reflects a profound dedication to his goals. His unwavering commitment to saving and reinvesting, even when faced with the temptation to improve his personal conditions, speaks volumes about his character.
The transformation from a small tuckshop to the owner of four large supermarkets is a testament to the power of hard work, honesty, and consistent principles. It's remarkable how he not only achieved personal success but also gave back to the community through initiatives like providing accessible water and electricity.
Your uncle's story serves as a beacon of inspiration for anyone striving for success and positive change. Thank you for sharing this uplifting narrative, and I hope it continues to motivate others to embrace the values of hard work and honesty in their own journeys.
18/12/23, 20:21 - Seith EWYL23E0736: Thank you ma'am
