Hope you are well.

I hope you are all pumped up for today's session.üöÄ
30/11/23, 13:45 - Sylvester EWYL23E0340: Yes Ms Aditi !!
30/11/23, 13:46 - Aditi Kapoor: We'll be beginning our new journey toward this earning and learning opportunity and I want you to commence with lots of enthusiasm and willingness to work hard to achieve your dreams as you wanted to build a community and I highly think of this as a great aspiration for giving back to the society and I am sure that this EWYL journey will not only help you to earn Scholarship credits but also upskill you and make you stand out from others and I want to make sure that you excel in all aspects of this journey.
30/11/23, 13:51 - Sylvester EWYL23E0340: That's great Ms Aditi
30/11/23, 14:01 - Aditi Kapoor: I'm eager to know what thrilling plans you have in store as you kick off your journey with these projects! What's your exciting plan of action?
30/11/23, 14:42 - Aditi Kapoor: The session has concluded; We left out a few important discussions, so your active participation and timely response is crucial, given the importance of the EWYL session.
30/11/23, 14:56 - Sylvester EWYL23E0340: Well l was thinking of taking it step, starting with project 1 advancing. Then l will be checking which project is going smoothly while trying to improve the others with no or little progress. In this way l think l'll be able to achieve great progress. So as for  now l'm looking for people who are interested in the Edoofian program, and those people will assist me to look for other interested students and so on.... So these people will join the whatsapp group l'll create. Also l was thinking of using other social media platforms like Telegram to spread the news faster. In brief l'll use anything to attract students, companies and schools into joining the Edoofian program. I think that will be a great headstart for me.
30/11/23, 15:35 - Aditi Kapoor: This is a great plan.
30/11/23, 15:35 - Sylvester EWYL23E0340: Thank you Ms Aditi üôÇüòä

02/12/23, 16:43 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL
02/12/23, 16:48 - Sylvester EWYL23E0340: Thank you, l shall share my my understanding...
02/12/23, 20:13 - Aditi Kapoor: _*Hello, my Proud Edoofian*_!

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

Best Regards

Sending you positive vibes for the start of this new week.

Are you prepared for today's session?
04/12/23, 13:14 - Sylvester EWYL23E0340: Yes Ms Aditi. I'm very much prepared
04/12/23, 13:18 - Aditi Kapoor: Great, so let's begin with your response on the Saturday Activity.
04/12/23, 14:29 - Aditi Kapoor: Alright! This is it for today. So we will resume our session in your allotted time slot.
Ensure that you submit your Saturday activity response and project updates with me before the end of the day.
04/12/23, 14:54 - Sylvester EWYL23E0340: Spirit of competition I believe it means the demonstration of competitive spirit, pushing yourself beyond your limitations , not giving up and setting goals for yourself to be the best out of others. This spirit drives us to be better version of your ordinary self. This helped me through my academic year by giving me the reason to improve myself above others, the need to win and motivation to be best. Throughout this previous academic year, l always thought l was doing enough to achieve success and then l came to a point where l realised l wasn‚Äôt doing enough compared to what my fellow students were doing. Of course l was better at some subjects but still that wasn‚Äôt enough. And sometimes what they were better at l was terrible at that. So l challenged myself to put more effort, and be the very best version of myself. I started setting small goals daily up to the point where l really felt my hard work paying off. Everybody started to notice the change in behaviour and performance, and asked what is it that l was really doing to improve myself and be better than others. The simple answer l gave them is ‚ÄúThe spirit of competition‚Äù. That‚Äôs all it takes to achieve success in your life, carry that around with you always and you‚Äôll always succeed in your life.I learned that l must not lose the spirit of competition in my life in order to be the better version of myself.

09/12/23, 16:39 - Aditi Kapoor: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!
