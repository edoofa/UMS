Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.

10/06/23, 13:08 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week’s Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better—together. It’s why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger—as successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!

13/06/23, 17:34 - Ananya: How are you Elina?
13/06/23, 17:36 - Elina EWYL22E1197: I'm fine thank you how are you?
13/06/23, 17:36 - Ananya: Thank you for asking, I am doing great!
13/06/23, 17:37 - Ananya: May I ask if you were able to complete your Saturday Activity?
13/06/23, 17:37 - Elina EWYL22E1197: No I wasn't I have been busy and I didn't have time
13/06/23, 17:37 - Elina EWYL22E1197: I was busy collecting documents required for the visa application
13/06/23, 17:38 - Ananya: Alright, so were you able to finish your tasks?
13/06/23, 17:40 - Elina EWYL22E1197: No I did not
13/06/23, 17:40 - Elina EWYL22E1197: I still have a few more documents to collect
13/06/23, 17:47 - Ananya: Alright, I understand. So how are the preparations going?
13/06/23, 18:21 - Elina EWYL22E1197: They are going just fine
13/06/23, 18:28 - Ananya: Now, Elina! I was just discussing productivity and the importance of seriousness in day-to-day life with a few of my students. Some of them expressed concerns about a decline in their performance and expressed a desire to address this issue. Hence, I thought about asking each student about their individual weaknesses and working together to overcome them. You see, I firmly believe that striving for perfection is both impossible and unnecessary. However, in order to make progress in life and stand out from the crowd, it's important to continuously strive to become a better version of ourselves. So, I wanted to inquire if you have ever encountered a situation where you identified a personal weak point and felt the need to rectify it.
13/06/23, 18:30 - Elina EWYL22E1197: My personal weak point is failure to understand in groups I personally find group work tricky because my concentration is less
13/06/23, 18:34 - Ananya: Well, Understanding and working well in groups can be hard for some people. To get better at it, here are a few things you can do:

- Practice concentrating: Concentration is a skill you can improve with practice. Try doing activities that need you to focus, like reading or solving puzzles. You can also try mindfulness exercises or meditation to help you concentrate better overall.

- Break tasks into smaller parts: Big group projects can be overwhelming and make it tough to concentrate. To make it easier, break the tasks into smaller, more manageable parts. Set goals and deadlines for each part so you can stay organized and focused.

- Talk openly with your group members: It's important to have clear communication in a group. Let your group members know about any concerns or difficulties you have. Being honest and open will help you find solutions that work for everyone.

- Manage your time well: Use effective time management strategies during group work. Set specific times for discussions and collaborative work, and have a clear plan for what needs to be done. Prioritize tasks and make sure you have enough time for each part of the project.
13/06/23, 18:34 - Ananya: - Ask for help: If you're having trouble understanding something in the group work, don't hesitate to ask your peers for help or clarification. Group work is about learning together, so take advantage of the knowledge and skills of your group members.

- Listen actively: When you're in group discussions or meetings, practice active listening. Pay attention, take notes, and ask questions to make sure you understand what's being said. Engaging actively in the conversation will help you understand and remember what the group is discussing.

- Reflect on your experiences: After each group work session, take some time to think about how you did and what you could improve. Consider what went well and what didn't, and come up with strategies to overcome any challenges you faced. Reflecting regularly will help you get better at understanding and contributing effectively in groups.
13/06/23, 18:40 - Elina EWYL22E1197: Thank you
13/06/23, 18:49 - Ananya: Now, may I know if you were able to find schools?
13/06/23, 18:58 - Elina EWYL22E1197: Yes I found a school but the head teacher asked me to write a letter to the district education board proposing the introduction of edoofa programme to that very school then after that I should get back to him so that I can do a PowerPoint presentation at the school
13/06/23, 18:58 - Elina EWYL22E1197: I am working on the letter at the moment
13/06/23, 18:59 - Elina EWYL22E1197: And I also searched up some companies so when do I have to send their details
13/06/23, 19:00 - Ananya: You can share the details in our next session. Now, let's conclude our session here. We will reconnect during our next session on Friday. In the meantime, please make sure to read our weekly newsletter so that we can discuss its contents in our upcoming session. 

Here I am sharing the Newsletter for the week. This week I would like to share some knowledge about how Failure is an inevitable part of our lives and how it teaches us to grow and build resilience. Also, check out the Edoofian Hall of Fame of the Bulawayo Proud Edoofians!

16/06/23, 18:11 - Elina EWYL22E1197: I understood that failure is an inevitable part of life, usually society glorifies success and stigmatizes failure....failure helps us confront our weaknesses, acknowledge our limitations and work on improving ourselves...failure is an important part of life because it leads to success and most successful people that have existed once underwent failure
16/06/23, 18:21 - Ananya: Failure indeed serves as a valuable teacher, allowing us to understand what doesn't work and guiding us towards more effective approaches in the future. It requires us to confront our weaknesses, acknowledge our limitations, and work on self-improvement.
