30/01/23, 23:42 - Saloni Rastogi: So tell me, which project are you targeting for the month of February out of the three?
31/01/23, 02:16 - Neville EWYL22E0911: I have been doing the community building project and I think I'm making some progress and hence there will be more applications sent to the group
31/01/23, 19:12 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Neville!
How are you?
31/01/23, 19:12 - Saloni Rastogi: I am so glad that you have been constantly active with me but before any progress that we make it is important that we follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' here, on the EWYL Line.
31/01/23, 19:12 - Saloni Rastogi: So, Neville this weekend we did not share any weekend activity with our students so that we can solely focus on building targets for the month of February. May I know what you thought about the same?
Since you have chosen the community building project, may I know with reference to that?
31/01/23, 19:18 - Neville EWYL22E0911: So the main target this month is to focus on two projects simultaneously ie the Community building and the African Schools Education Reform Mission. I have already made a plan on how I can talk to the various principals of the schools and concerning the Community building I have already created a platform and have reached out to some friends and will be hearing from them soon. I hope to have at least 30 applications within this month which l will share on the platform.
31/01/23, 19:19 - Neville EWYL22E0911: That's correct,  I'm sorry for not keeping up with that but I will sure do.
01/02/23, 00:44 - Saloni Rastogi: I believe that for this month we can focus just on the African School Reform project and work hard on it. Side by side you can work on community building as well.
01/02/23, 00:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's connect tomorrow for the updates.

I will be sharing the Wednesday wisdom with you tomorrow!

Till then, please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'.
Have a great day!
01/02/23, 01:05 - Neville EWYL22E0911: Okay
01/02/23, 14:58 - Neville EWYL22E0911: I am a proud Edoofian
01/02/23, 15:00 - Saloni Rastogi: - That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!

How are you?
02/02/23, 20:00 - Saloni Rastogi: Please make sure that you follow the daily ritual with full consistency daily.
02/02/23, 20:00 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
02/02/23, 20:00 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
02/02/23, 20:04 - Neville EWYL22E0911: Good Morning, 
Thanks for the reminder, I truly am a proud Edoofian ?
02/02/23, 20:30 - Neville EWYL22E0911: Okay
02/02/23, 21:24 - Saloni Rastogi: Can I please have your understanding of the Wednesday lesson and updates on projects?
02/02/23, 22:39 - Neville EWYL22E0911: Good Afternoon.
Thanks for sharing the Wednesday wisdom and I really enjoyed getting a deeper perspective on LinkedIn and networking on the platform.
Now you shared ways of building a network on LinkedIn which are :

● Strengthening one's profile 
One can add their most outstanding work that defines them and hence other users may get to know how efficient they are.
So the LinkedIn profile can be Strengthened by thorough personalization of one's account.

●Usage of LinkedIn Groups 
These help to identify people who are interested in the same areas and hence it will be easier to reach out to them.

●Building one's digital footprint ? 
With the increase in technological innovation companies now wish to employ people from these platforms like LinkedIn. Now usage of LinkedIn builds up a brand or rather \"digital footprint\" which employers wish to get. Hence this is a networking tool.
02/02/23, 23:15 - Saloni Rastogi: I appreciate the understanding that you have shared with me on the lesson Neville ✨ .
02/02/23, 23:15 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know how would it help you to build connections on LinkedIn?
03/02/23, 00:16 - Neville EWYL22E0911: Okay.

The first point is more about expressing oneself out there. i.e the more details a person puts on their profile , the more the other people are going to know about them. A poorly personalised account can barely attract those reputable business owners but on the contrary,  a well revised and personalised account attracts those people from big companies. Thus,  well personalised account has a certain degree of authenticity and professionalism an individual needs to build the connections!


The second point. Is as clear as it sounds , a group generally makes access to a lot of people easier since one doesn't have to search for them. It's a perfect tool to discover even other professionals one could never have reached out to and the fact that you will be in the same group creates a common ground whereby you can talk to them without sounding weird or awkward. So groups hence a a useful networking tool.

And about the third point, 
You mentioned that companies are searching for individuals who are competent and equipped with 21st century skills. Proper use of LinkedIn gives individuals that opportunity to express themselves as a global citizen...  hence if one has built up a digital footprint they can easily make meaningful connections.
03/02/23, 01:29 - Saloni Rastogi: I am sharing a link below, You can go through this during your free time. It contains information regarding the skills that are required by anyone who wants to succeed in his\/.her career.

With this, have a great day and please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'.
03/02/23, 02:15 - Neville EWYL22E0911: Okay thanks
03/02/23, 16:27 - Neville EWYL22E0911: I am a proud Edoofian
03/02/23, 16:28 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

This weekend activity was very much learning and exploring and about 'Writing a LinkedIn Connection Request Introduction Message'. I personally learnt a lot through this activity because as a mentor, my role is to bring out with best opportunities for my student via webinars and a big source of the same is  For the same we reach out to more than 50 leaders in a week and this has helped us a lot.

So, in today's session, we will discuss about:
1) your message draft that you have used while connecting with others
2) updates on the respective project
06/02/23, 21:24 - Saloni Rastogi: So, have you arranged for the contact details of the Headmaster?

06/02/23, 22:43 - Neville EWYL22E0911: This project is already in action though I tied 1 school in my neighbourhood and the principal was skeptical of Edoofa but I will be seeing them again this week to get the contact details and will share them with you.

08/02/23, 16:39 - Neville EWYL22E0911: Good Morning Ms.
So the most unfortunate thing happened to me yesterday as my WhatsApp account was temporarily suspended due to a some spam report. I think its probably due to the group I had created for my new EWYL project applicants. So this made me to lose the group as all the WhatsApp data was erased. I got my account back now and I will be working well to continue the project.

14/02/23, 16:47 - Neville EWYL22E0911: For the weekend activity. 

So as a board member of the schools LEO Club at St Faiths I started a *warm up Zimbabwe campaign* so this was literally a charity project in which we would collect jerseys , scarfs ,  winter hats and most importantly blankets to the homeless people in the St Faiths High school area and our primary concern was the Jairos Jiri Centre which is a few kilometres from the school. So this project was done in the winter of 2021. 

_*Challenges faced*_
It really was a very noble project to participate in however there was also resistance in the club as other members had other projects in mind so the challenge was to really make people understand why it was necessary to take part in the campaign and also to really take note of the way we would be making somebody's life easier.

The second challenge was cooperation from my colleagues and teachers. Some people were quite reluctant to part with their winter wear and also since this was a community project we also had to reach out to the community to collect donations of the warm clothes and blankets. So it really took a higher level of communication skills to really convince people to participate. The big challenge for me was to get myself out there and talk to strangers. I had considered myself as an introvert but I became really good with talking to people and thus the project registered success.


*How I showcased the inner sense of captaincy*

I believe coming up with such a project and convincing others to participate was a really cool thing. This project was also supported by the school administration and also several teachers and school staff donated which was really an achievement for the LEO club. 

*Results of my actions and how I felt*

So we managed to collect many jeseys , blankets and all those winter wear and donated them to Jairos Jiri Association which is a children's home facility. But the most important impact we did was to influence other schools to do t
