How are you?
To correct you here, the spelling of edoofian is incorrect.
08/05/23, 17:57 - Saloni Rastogi: No worries, I am all here. May I know on which project are you planning to focus in May?

08/05/23, 18:44 - Saloni Rastogi: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:

18/11/23, 13:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Mr Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
