If you are ready then we can begin?

How are you doing today?

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. This week's Wednesday wisdom gave you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

In our session today, we will discuss:
▪️your understanding of persuasion
▪️targets for the projects for the month of January 2023
06/01/23, 20:38 - Mayibingwe EWYL21E0760: Am good thank you
06/01/23, 20:38 - Mayibingwe EWYL21E0760: Noted
06/01/23, 21:14 - Saloni Rastogi: I hope you went through the lesson, it was actually very amazing!
What do you have to say about that?
06/01/23, 22:15 - Mayibingwe EWYL21E0760: Yes it was very amazing indeed, l understood several principles of persuasion which some of them are commitment and consistency, and Authority were an individual who is authoritative, credible and knowledgeable in his or her field is more influential and persuasive than the one who is not.
06/01/23, 22:15 - Mayibingwe EWYL21E0760: Yes it was very amazing indeed, l understood several principles of persuasion which some of them are commitment and consistency, and Authority were an individual who is authoritative, credible and knowledgeable in his or her field is more influential and persuasive than the one who is not.
06/01/23, 22:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Your understanding is very impressive Mayibingwe!
What I understood from the lesson is that Understanding the art of persuasion can not only help you learn how to influence others; it can also make you more aware of the techniques others might use to try and change your beliefs and behaviors.
06/01/23, 22:22 - Saloni Rastogi: You have chosen community building project, may I know how are you working on it and what are your weekly targets?
06/01/23, 22:31 - Mayibingwe EWYL21E0760: Yes
06/01/23, 22:34 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share with me your targets and plan of action towards it?
06/01/23, 22:34 - Mayibingwe EWYL21E0760: Finding students and informing them about Edoofa
06/01/23, 22:35 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know how would you do that?
06/01/23, 22:37 - Mayibingwe EWYL21E0760: By reaching out to the nearest schools and to those in my community
06/01/23, 22:40 - Saloni Rastogi: What would you do after reaching out to schools?
06/01/23, 22:43 - Mayibingwe EWYL21E0760: Inform the students about Edoofa scholarship program and offering  them opportunity to be part of Edoofa as well
06/01/23, 22:45 - Saloni Rastogi: That's a great idea, but lI think it can be very time-consuming.
06/01/23, 22:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Some of my students have formed a WhatsApp group where they:
First, they keep sharing the link of that WhatsApp group in their family groups, class groups, and school groups (A-Level and O-Level), with the children who stay nearby (who want to pursue their higher education), and, try to circulate all around.
Second, once new people get added to the group, they are told about Edoofa, the perks of being associated with it, why studying in India could be a great opportunity, their journey so far, learnings from EWYL Program, and more.
Third, they share the community building form with them, and then the children fill out the form and share it with them.

What do you think about this?
06/01/23, 22:56 - Mayibingwe EWYL21E0760: Great that's so great
06/01/23, 23:11 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes Mayibingwe, I don't want you to miss the opportunity to earn your scholarship credits. I would encourage you to take an early start.
06/01/23, 23:21 - Mayibingwe EWYL21E0760: Yes thank you! I understand that
06/01/23, 23:31 - Mayibingwe EWYL21E0760: So which step should I take now?

Problem-solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem-solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals toward achieving this goal. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem-solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

I would appreciate you sharing your learnings from today’s lesson.
