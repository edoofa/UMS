Today, let's work on the next step which is to plan how to be financially independent by utilizing your time with the right projects. As an activity for this week, I want you to draft a document mentioning:

a)Target- no. of credits you want to earn in the month of October
b)How many projects can you work upon
c)Number of hours that you can devote to your projects
d)Name of the projects that you want to be a part of
e)Plan of action with your mentors

So we know, a lot of you have been keeping busy these days with your exams and academic curriculum. And while we wish you all the luck for it, we don't want you to miss out on your learning and skill building. In today's lesson, we will discuss how to build our capacity to multitask, manage our time and prioritize our daily tasks in order to have it all. 

Let's dig right in, and understand how if you follow these steps, you will be able to manage your exams, assignments, extra curriculars, and your EWYL projects all at one go. After going through this, you must discuss the plan of action to execute these steps with your mentors.

Happy Learning!

13/10/22, 19:41 - Unknown: I noticed that you have not submitted the Saturday’s Activity yet. The deadline for that was Tuesday 6 PM but I gave you a leeway. Due to the delay, You also missed out on the Wednesday lesson that I was not able to share with you due to the pending last two submissions.

Today, At all costs, I would need the submission for the Last week's Saturday Activity.
I am sharing it below.

After that, I am sharing this week's Wednesday Lesson which you have to submit on Friday by 6 PM.

We can not allow ourselves to at a such mediocre pace.
If somehow, You have not received it, I am sharing it below again.
13/10/22, 19:41 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.

Hello my dear Edoofians
Hope you are doing well. This week we learned about one of the most popular yet grounded people who used social media as a tool to become an educator and give back to the community and still become an entrepreneur.
This week I want you to reflect on what your strengths and skills are to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 

These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content etc.
