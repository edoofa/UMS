04/01/23, 23:49 - Unknown: *Wednesday Lesson | 4 Jan*

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy learning.
06/01/23, 22:00 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: Hello Ms Deepali

06/01/23, 22:13 - Unknown: Greetings, Tecla
I hope that you are doing well
06/01/23, 22:14 - Unknown: I hope that your friend is feeling fine now?
11/01/23, 00:16 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: I understood that there are 6 principles of persuation in the marker place by Cialdini.
These principles help in increasing one's sales and gain trust from the public. These principles include  RECIPROCITY which states that people tend to do unto others as others have done to them. It states that people do favors for people who have done favors for them more like the reciprocate where they are reciprocated. It states that people fulfill the society obligation if they are treated right. Hence if a seller uses this notion he's likely to attract more publicity
SCARCITY is another principle that is used to create a huge demand for certain products. Sellers use this to create  a sense of demand where they make less products or advertise in limited stock to put pressure on people thus increasing the demand
AUTHORITY is used to show sense of knowledge, credibility and expertise in one's work. This gives and gains attraction and a sense of trust from the public as they want to buy from trustworthy and expert sellers. 
LIKING this is where the seller aims to be liked by the public as people tend to buy from the people they like and trust. This increases sales as people will be coming in groups to the person they like. Also the use of known and liked persons on advertisements also attracts most customers as they will feel closer to that person. 
CONSENSUS this one states that people tend to look at other people before they make certain decisions hence this influences them. If one customer buys and likes then she will tell others and others may but too thus sell is increased hence a good impact is needed
11/01/23, 22:15 - Unknown: Great work, Tecla!
I am sure that you would be using the skills you mentioned above to increase your credit earnings?
Also, I hope that from next time, You will keep the deadlines in mind.
11/01/23, 22:16 - Unknown: Edoofian, You have not submitted the Saturday Activity’s response yet.
Please let me know if you are facing any challenges.
11/01/23, 22:16 - Unknown: Also, Tecla, I hope that you are aware that we missed both our sessions in the past 7 days.
11/01/23, 22:57 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: Yes sir
11/01/23, 22:58 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: Yes sir
11/01/23, 22:58 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: Let me submit sir
11/01/23, 23:08 - Unknown: Tecla, Do you think that we would be able to earn the desired amount of credits this way?
11/01/23, 23:41 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: No sir
11/01/23, 23:42 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: Just that I'm demotivated I've been doin these projects for months now but I've never earned any credits
11/01/23, 23:42 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: I'm starting to feel that mybe I'll never earn anything
11/01/23, 23:47 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: I'd intend to create a pace where most students are likely to want to follow and reach where I've riched and thus motivating them to participate and worker harder on their projects
I'd like that students start small projects that connect them with their respective communities and as time goes on it expands high up untill it reaches broader communities
11/01/23, 23:49 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: For example sir students in Bahadurgah (Edoofians) to be exact can start a Voluntary community service where they organize a day to mybe clean the streets or even clean PDM University that would give them a sense of responsibility and it can attract many people who will recognize their enthusiasm
11/01/23, 23:52 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: Or PDM Edoofians can organize a fundraiser and raise money to donate to the local people in need this also gives them a sense of responsibility and passion for the community it also connects them with communities until they are recognized worldwide for their deeds. Imagine sir University students raising funds to help the poor its such a blessed act and it catches much attention in that way the Edoofa flag is raised higher and most African or even students from other countries may want to be part of Edoofa
11/01/23, 23:53 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: Those are my thoughts sir
12/01/23, 18:43 - Unknown: Greetings, Tecla
How are you?
This is a very nice idea, Tecla.
12/01/23, 18:43 - Unknown: I understand how you are feeling.
I would like to share an email that I received from one of my student yesterday. Please have a look at it.
I am very keen to know how you feel about this.
12/01/23, 19:21 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: I feel very happy for him. Atleast he has earned all of these credits he's very lucky
12/01/23, 19:22 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: I too want to earn some credits. What did he do to earn all of those
12/01/23, 19:23 - Unknown: The most important thing is that he is always regular and active during our sessions
12/01/23, 19:25 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: I'll become regular too
12/01/23, 19:25 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: I won't miss any session but sir promise I'll earn too
12/01/23, 19:25 - Unknown: I am glad to hear that, Tecla
12/01/23, 19:25 - Unknown: Wednesday Lesson

Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals towards achieving this goal. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

I would appreciate you sharing your learnings from today’s lesson. 

Happy learning!

12/01/23, 19:27 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: So sir ever since I started I haven't earned anything?
12/01/23, 19:38 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: Was I off topic here?
12/01/23, 19:52 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: It talks about the the 5 problem solving strategies by Billionaire Charlie Munger
SIMPLIFY is the first strategy where he says looking at a problem on its simple form is helpful where one decides whether the problem is huge or minor
NUMERICAL FLUENCY this is where one has to fiew problems as math in order to be able to come up with the best soulution in a good formular
INVERT this notion is said to help more in avoiding trouble than solving it. Problems are thought forwardly and backwards to find the cause n future evaluation.
STUDY THE BASICS
12/01/23, 20:34 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: Study the basics talks about the use of multidisciplinary approach. He says one must use the easy to learn concept where elementary ideas will solve problems.

Hello my dear Edoofians
Hope you are doing well. This week we learned about one of the most popular yet grounded people who used social media as a tool to become an educator and give back to the community and still become an entrepreneur.
This week I want you to reflect on what your strengths and skills are to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 

These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content etc.
Please share these skills and instances where you were able to showcase these skills in your next session.
Till then 
Happy Learning!

17/10/22, 20:38 - Unknown: Great!
17/10/22, 20:39 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: I have never done any of the above sir. I have not been much of a social media person
17/10/22, 20:45 - Unknown: I understand that, Tecla.
Let me share a very interesting document with you.
You can go through it after our today's session.
17/10/22, 20:48 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: Ok sir
17/10/22, 20:49 - Unknown: So May I know the Project that you want to work on this week and the target that you have set for yourself regarding that project?
17/10/22, 20:51 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: I want to finish the African Schools Reform mission project this week
17/10/22, 20:53 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: The only thing delaying my interactions with schools is that O'level and A'level students are starting their exams next week so most teachers in charge and heards are busy with preparations so they do not have enough time to listen
17/10/22, 20:54 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: So my other alternative is to  look for a company to work with on my first project so I'm kind of doing both
17/10/22, 20:54 - Unknown: That's a Great Idea.
So, May I know what target have you keep for both these projects?
17/10/22, 20:59 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: By the end of this week my target on the recent project I'd have atleast talked to 2 more schools then on the Company that I'm searching for I'd have found a potential person who'll be able to interact with you
17/10/22, 21:00 - Unknown: That's Great!
But keep most of the focus on the School Project
17/10/22, 21:00 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: I haven't ignored the community building project. I'm targeting the current upper sixs i know that once they are done with exams only then would they be planning on university so I'm waiting for them to finish writing since right now they are under exam pressure
17/10/22, 21:01 - Unknown: Yes, You are right.
But keep in touch with these students and start gathering the information
17/10/22, 21:01 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: It could take a month or so for them to finish exams but the wait will be worth it so right now I'm advertising and not really in a rush for responses since I'm giving them time to rate themselves after exams
17/10/22, 21:02 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: Yes sir I'll do that thank you
17/10/22, 21:02 - Tecla EWYL22E0353: Ok sir thank you

We have students who have completed their Bachelor's and are now pursuing their masters from here in India. Edoofa carries a reputation because of the foster care it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program. Every student gets a counselor assisted by at least three mentors for comprehensive guidance. Also, Edoofa is working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare.

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains! Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. They are associated with more than 90 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA.

[18\/10, 08:09] Cutey?: I studied at Sarah Bata Senior School from 2016 to 2019 i sat for my Olevel june exams at Chaplin high since SBSS had no centre at that time but for November i sat for the exams at SBSS. 
For my A'level i was at Prestige High School In Bulawayo and after my A'level i heard about Edoofa from a friend of mine who is in India now by Edoofa and i googled it up to check if its legit and yes it very well known and 100% legit so i applied. It took time for me to be replied and also took time for me to convince them that i am really eligible for the scholarship through onlime tests and interviews and i finally got accepted and now i am an Edoofian.

Edoofa has been in existence for 4.5 years in West Africa and 11 years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of over 2000 students. We have students who have completed their Bachelor's and are now pursuing their masters from here in India. Edoofa carries a reputation because of the foster care it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program. Every student gets a counselor assisted by at least three mentors for comprehensive guidance. Also, Edoofa is working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program to offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within a span of 3 years.

19/10/22, 18:15 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
