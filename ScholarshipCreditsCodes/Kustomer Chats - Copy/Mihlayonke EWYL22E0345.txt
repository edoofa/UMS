19/07/22, 23:23 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my proud EDOOFIAN!
I hope you are doing well.
SWOT analysis might sound something complex but I am sure that while going through our weekend activity, you might have gone through what a SWOT means thoroughly and gained much knowledge on the same. The weekend activity asked us to draw a SWOT analysis of any company.
I want to share your response with me here Mihlayonke.
19/07/22, 23:45 - Mihlayonke EWYL22E0345: Mining, agriculture,banking etc i could list as much different sectors but amongst the listed we realised a high growth rate in the àgriculture sector. As a developing country, it means we have to rely on the extraction which is the primary level of production. Zimbabwe as a technological ineffective country it has the ability to extract the raw materials but inability to process the materials. Example given the mining sector would have been ranked number one growing industry but due to inadequate machinery to process mineral ore to a perfect piece of jewel, it lost the number one title. 
Instead of crying foul the government helps, encourages and educates people on mass agriculture production. There are some financial institutions such as Agribank which give out farming based loans which will help citizens take such opportunities to engage in the activity. This helps partakers provide for themselves and also increase the GDP at large. 
The most grown crop is maize which is the staple crop and 80% of the citizens grow it. In the SADC trading bloc Zimbabwe is responsible for food security which also gives us the drive to dwell more on Agriculture activity. 

However as much as the industry is growing it is facing challenges of inflation. The granted loans tend to lose value due to the sweeped buying power of the local currency leading to unsettled debts and further withdrawal of the economic players. 
The sector depends more on climate. In other regions which are technically equipped, they invested in other means such as irrigation and cloud seeding but due to poor development only a few players are well aware to this system.
20/07/22, 01:16 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Mihlayonke!
How's your day going?
20/07/22, 01:19 - Aditi Kapoor: I read your response and it made me so inquisitive about the agriculture sector in Zimbabwe, and what i got to know is  in Zimbabwe is overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture. Agriculture accounts for 18% of Zimbabwe's GDP as of 2015. Agriculture enabled people to produce surplus food. There are different crops that farmers grow and some of these include, maize, sorghum, rapoko, groundnuts, round-nuts and beans.
I am amazed to see your response mihlayonke.
20/07/22, 01:20 - Aditi Kapoor: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader. 
Also Mihlayonke, along with the SWOT analysis of a company, I would appreciate it if you also share a SWOT analysis of yourself. I want to see how much more you have learned beyond this activity.
20/07/22, 01:46 - Mihlayonke EWYL22E0345: As an up growing individual, it serves as a must to do a character building especially for an aspiring Chartered Accountant. 
I am a trustworthy individual and this has been proven in many ways like being the junior director for the youth and as part of the role i get to keep the club money. 
To add on above, i am a good team player, i have worked with other youngster of my age in a broiler production project and it was successful.
However my perfect moulded character has loopholes which challenge my aspirations.  One being the knowledge deficiency on computer world. I face many challenges especially if the problem has to be solved technically. 
In evaluation of the above analysis, i am passionate in learning more and more skills technically which will create many opportunities for me to climb my ladder although the financial crisis, economic situations stand as a threat
20/07/22, 02:06 - Aditi Kapoor: That is so amazing that you have recognized your qualities and strengths very well and I am very sure that using those to your best, you can overcome all your weakness and threats.
20/07/22, 02:09 - Mihlayonke EWYL22E0345: Thank you maam. I believe so

22/07/22, 05:41 - Mihlayonke EWYL22E0345: Can current A level students apply?
22/07/22, 19:20 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Mihlayonke!
Yes, current A level students can apply.
23/07/22, 01:53 - Aditi Kapoor: Along with this, let's move on with our session.
Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our WEDNESDAY Wisdom was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
23/07/22, 02:18 - Mihlayonke EWYL22E0345: 1.
A successful person accepts his responsibility and learns from his failures. I also learnt that a successful person doesn't do different things from one who is a failure but instead he does things differently. Attitude plays an important role in shaping someone's success. A positive attitude enables a responsible and drive.  Failures always find something or someone to blame for their fiascos.
Magic and lucky don't exist one has to work hard in order to achieve. 
Dreams dont work unless you do.

23/07/22, 03:38 - Aditi Kapoor: Also Mihlayonke, I read your response and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful: hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like, not what others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
23/07/22, 03:49 - Mihlayonke EWYL22E0345: Thank you maam
25/07/22, 03:18 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
