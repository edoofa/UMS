22/12/23, 18:54 - Nigel EWYL23E0738: Learned that Christmas is a festive all about sharing love that is all about having love for each other having togetherness with others. 

Families reunite during this festive with decorations and lights behind those family gathering sharing love giving each other gifts and so on.

I like this Christmas because it reunites families even from different regions they have to send representatives
22/12/23, 19:01 - Aditi Kapoor: I'm glad you enjoyed the lesson and resonated with the essence of Christmas! It's heartwarming to see how this festive season brings families together, fostering love, togetherness, and the joy of sharing. The decorations and lights indeed add a special touch, creating a festive and cheerful atmosphere. The idea of families reuniting, even if through representatives, showcases the significance of connection and shared moments during this special time. Wishing you a wonderful and joy-filled Christmas season ahead! üéÑüåüüíñ
22/12/23, 19:03 - Nigel EWYL23E0738: Wish you the same Christmas Festive stay blessed. However avoid over speeding racing with time because this is also the time of high trafficking in roads so try by all means to avoid accidents.

22/12/23, 19:17 - Nigel EWYL23E0738: On reform mission I am trying my best to reach out to schools I think are more advanced. However it is taking long for the ones I'm trying to be in touch wich for them to respond. Patience pays I am still waiting for their response. I think the main reason is that they are on holidays. I will keep trying
22/12/23, 19:19 - Nigel EWYL23E0738: As for now 4 students have filled the forms and I have already submitted them in my EWYL group. Now I don't now if the admins have made their step of creating their group that's where counseling is done

26/12/23, 11:11 - Nigel EWYL23E0738: On Christmas the whole family of us gathers together at a certain place whether it is our home or other places. This time our family elders decided to gather at a park.

There were as many as possible people of Chapwanya family. Those who are the heads of family oders food which is rarely eaten during normal days. No limit for food as we enjoy this festive.

Those who created gifts for their loved ones anytime you can give it to your preferred person. We spend the whole day enjoying ourselves and sharing love as a family.

After eating lunch elders are given attention for them to say guiding words in life. Everyone payed attention. Elders are given their respect respectively.

How ever at around 0300 pm we arange a soccer match anyone interested can play. Anyone can choose any side given few seconds to choose no much time to think. Then after those who drink beer can go to beer halls lately enjoying their selfs.
