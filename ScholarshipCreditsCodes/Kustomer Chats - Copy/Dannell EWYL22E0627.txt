15/11/22, 22:54 - Ananya: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.

16/05/23, 13:10 - Dannell EWYL22E0627: Greetings, Ms Ananya I am Dannell and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Dannell EWYL22E0627
16/05/23, 15:33 - Ananya: It is your session time! I am expecting  "I am your proud Edoofian" to begin your session!
23/05/23, 22:40 - Dannell EWYL22E0627: Greetings Ma'am my phone had broke i wasn't able to do much with it soo i got a new one sorry for not being available ma'am
24/05/23, 15:28 - Ananya: That is alright, I understand.
29/05/23, 15:34 - Dannell EWYL22E0627: Greetings ma'am
29/05/23, 15:35 - Dannell EWYL22E0627: Yesterday i was at the meeting and it was amazing
29/05/23, 15:35 - Dannell EWYL22E0627: I'm a proud edoofian
29/05/23, 15:35 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
29/05/23, 15:38 - Dannell EWYL22E0627: Thank you ma'am soo much motivation, indeed there's a lot in team work.

06/06/23, 16:09 - Dannell EWYL22E0627: Ok Ma'am followingüåü
06/06/23, 16:09 - Ananya: Today we're going to talk about how to find student-centric SMEs in Africa using Google and LinkedIn. Are you familiar with these tools?
06/06/23, 16:10 - Dannell EWYL22E0627: Yes ma'am I'm familiar
06/06/23, 16:11 - Ananya: Well, that's good! Let's start with Google. When you're searching for student-centric SMEs in Africa, what keywords do you think you should use?
06/06/23, 16:13 - Dannell EWYL22E0627: Mmm maybe education
06/06/23, 16:18 - Ananya: That's a good start. You could also try "student-centered SMEs in Africa" or "African startups focused on education". Once you have a list of relevant startups, the next step is to find the company officials on LinkedIn. Have you used LinkedIn before?
06/06/23, 16:19 - Dannell EWYL22E0627: I haven't ma'am
06/06/23, 16:23 - Ananya: That's okay. LinkedIn is a professional networking platform where you can connect with people in your industry. First, you'll need to create a profile if you haven't already. Then, you can search for the company you're interested in by typing the name of the company into the search bar.
06/06/23, 17:18 - Dannell EWYL22E0627: Ok ma'am following
12/06/23, 18:14 - Dannell EWYL22E0627: Ma'am I'm failing to create an account on LinkedIn
13/06/23, 15:36 - Ananya: Greetings, Dannell! How are you?
13/06/23, 15:38 - Dannell EWYL22E0627: I'm good ma'am how are you doing
13/06/23, 15:38 - Ananya: Thank you for asking, I am doing great!
13/06/23, 15:39 - Ananya: We shall discuss about your LinkedIn profile, before that may I ask if you were able to complete your Saturday activity?
13/06/23, 15:40 - Dannell EWYL22E0627: Ok ma'am
13/06/23, 15:41 - Dannell EWYL22E0627: This one?
13/06/23, 15:41 - Ananya: This: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week‚Äôs Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better‚Äîtogether. It‚Äôs why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger‚Äîas successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself. 

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon. 
Till then Happy Learning!
13/06/23, 15:43 - Dannell EWYL22E0627: Ok ma'am i didn't see that one let me work on it sorry ma'am
13/06/23, 15:44 - Ananya: That is alright.
