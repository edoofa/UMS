I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to let you know that today's Wednesday lesson is going to be a special one. We'll be delving into a captivating story that revolves around the themes of skill, hard work, and determination.

The moral of this story is a powerful one, and it's a lesson that we can carry with us throughout our lives: "Sometimes the truest treasures lay not in the allure of gold but in the craftsmanship and effort one invests in their work." This story will remind us of the value of dedication and the importance of striving for excellence in everything we do.

So, come prepared to listen, learn, and be inspired by this tale of determination and the rewards it can bring. We'll discuss the story, its characters, and the valuable lesson it imparts.

See you in our upcoming session, and let's explore the world of skill, hard work, and the true treasures that lie within our reach.

Best regards,
Team EWYL!

01/02/23, 15:05 - Progress EWYL22E0894: Profile Introduction.

My name is Progress Marumbwa. I was born on the 15 of June 2003. l am a Zimbabwean citizen by birth. I come from a family of 6 exclusive of my parents. My father is a teacher. My mother is a brave hardworking housewife who is self employed. Our family is so big that my father couldn't afford all of our basic needs so we often go for manual work in other people's fields. We also do physical projects such as poultry and farming to support ourselves. We used to walk door to door selling vhickens and vegetables and that was our main source of income.

For my primary education l learnt at Chiredzi Primary School which was 3 km away from my home area. I was well-known as the best singer in music club and long jumb. I was a very sharp student who was chosen to be a leader of the quiz clud and we often go for competitions. I achieved an aggregate of six units in my grade 7 examinations.

For my secondary and high School education l learnt at St Joseph Tongoona High School. The school is 10 km away from my home area that means l walked more than 20 km per day for six years to complete my high school education. It was very tough for me to travel such long distances but l eventually accepted the situation and get used to it. I sometimes go to school without taking any food . I am a talented and fast learner who is so cooperative. I am able to learn or work under pressure and versatile. I am able to work with multicultural people from different back grounds. I am an honest girl who is cspsblyof learning with minimum supervision whilst l am confident to seek any guidance from other people. I can learn new activities from other people. I am also able to perform multitasks at the same time. My weakness is that if l am criticized or judgedl quickly lose confidence. I am a flexible person who can adapt to any situation. One more thing l am not interested to be involved in arguments, l always chose peace and prefer to be quiet.

03/02/23, 18:04 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr

03/02/23, 22:08 - Jasmine Kaur: You know what will happen when you every morning are saying that you are a proud Edoofian, you are sending a message to the universe that you believe in who you are, you are dedicated to this student community, you are part of the ambitious Edoofians.
I hope that you will be performing this ritual everyday on the *EWYL DEDICATED LINE* at 9 AM With help of the above text, can you define who an Edoofian is?
03/02/23, 22:19 - Progress EWYL22E0894: An Edoofian is a student who believe in who he\/ she is and a student who is dedicated the community .
03/02/23, 22:35 - Jasmine Kaur: Correct and may I know according to you, how many of these attributes are there in you as well?
03/02/23, 22:44 - Progress EWYL22E0894: I can only inform you that l am a dedicated person.
03/02/23, 22:47 - Jasmine Kaur: That is great so daily texting me in the morning saying- I am a proud Edoofian should charge you up and fill you with Pride. Let us make it our daily ritual!

Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
