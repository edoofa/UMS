How are you?
16/11/22, 22:30 - Unknown: I see you have not followed the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' for today.
16/11/22, 22:30 - Unknown: Hello, my dear proud Edoofian. I hope all is well with you.

Another insightful Wednesday Wisdom is presented here. The lesson today teaches us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, disability. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition. A few questions near the end of the session will ask you to reflect and have an open dialogue with yourself. After you finish your lesson, as your mentor, I'd like to have a thorough conversation about your key take aways, in our upcoming sessions.

Enjoy the article and keep in mind that success does not come to you suddenly; rather, it can be attained over time by making modest, daily improvements.

Happy learning!

How are you?

The Wednesday lesson taught us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, _disability_. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition.

In our session, we will discuss:
1) your understanding of how disability is different from what we thought about it earlier
2) progress on the projects
17/11/22, 21:38 - Unknown: You have to follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' everyday without fail Tariro.
17/11/22, 21:39 - Unknown: Also Tariro, we recently discussed so many projects. I would like that you work on the African School Reform Project :fireworks:
17/11/22, 21:40 - Unknown: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.

17/11/22, 22:17 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

On my Wednesday lesson l learnt about the secret Santa who made this world a better place with his random act of kindness.
Larry Deon Stewart known as the secret Santa was once helped by a cookie to pay his food bills and since then he made a promise to himself that he would help others who were in need of help but always keep his identity a secret.
He trained other people who are today carrying on with the culture of giving gifts and acts of kindness to those in need though keeping their identity a secret.
The only thing secret Santa asked of the people he helped is that they would do a random act of kindness to help another person someday.

Go out with friends to parties, eat with no concern, go to a church or set up Christmas at your home. Have a Christmas and New Year of your desire. Then come back with much more energy as your EWYL team has planned a very fruitful year ahead of you.

Many more projects, more skills to master, more exposure to new companies, more knowledge, and more surprises. :gift-box:
