30/06/23, 13:58 - Courtney EWYL23E0079: Greetings, Mr. Maurice, I am Courtney and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
30/06/23, 14:01 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello Courtney, Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Line. Here we practice a 'mantra' where you should always start and end the day by saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' to boost your energy!
30/06/23, 14:01 - Jasmine Kaur: we shall be having our session on Monday and Thursday at 12 PM-2PM so be sure to come on time 5 minutes before and share the mantra ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù to mark your attendance.
30/06/23, 14:01 - Jasmine Kaur: You will be sharing the Proud Edoofian mantra every day to mark your attendance and when you won't be having your sessions on Tuesday and Friday, you will be receiving a task or interesting story to learn from.
30/06/23, 14:01 - Jasmine Kaur: And on Wednesdays I will also share the lesson with you so come around 12PM to receive the lesson
Similarly, I will share the Saturday Activity on Saturday so come over around 12PM to receive the same.
30/06/23, 14:02 - Jasmine Kaur: So from now on it is very important for you to be active in the sessions at the designated times shared with you as it will be a factor to consider your attendance and ultimately for the Edoofa Grant too.
30/06/23, 14:02 - Jasmine Kaur: Keep a note on the time table as we strictly connect only at 12-2PM just twice a week, and the rest of the days, you have to share the mantra to mark your attendance before 12PM
30/06/23, 14:02 - Jasmine Kaur: I hope you understand the time schedules that I have explained, if you have any queries, you can ask now as we will be strictly following the timelines.
30/06/23, 14:04 - Courtney EWYL23E0079: I understand sir
30/06/23, 14:04 - Courtney EWYL23E0079: Thank you

30/06/23, 16:42 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello dear Edoofian, 
Be ready to start the month of July with a thrilling challenge of 21 days! Consistency is the key to the treasure of the Edoofa Grant which I am sure you must have heard about! 

I want you to go through the document I am sharing with you and starting 3rd July, Monday, we are going to start the challenge. Your each and every step in the program will be evaluated and it is not just you, it is going to a competition amongst 100s of other Edoofians who are going for the prize and although it will ultimately depend upon your performance, you also have to keep in mind that this is a challenge so you should give your best to get the Grant!! 

Read the document thoroughly and you have time till Saturday to ask me any queries you have as we will be starting from Monday and note that we are going to conduct this only through the EWYL Line. All the best!!
30/06/23, 16:42 - Jasmine Kaur: We have been having sessions regularly however let me redefine what a session is again.
In order for us to have a successful session, I will be evaluating each session on 3 particular points to be eligible for the Grant.

1. You have to share the "Proud Edoofian" ritual before 12:00PM to mark your attendance
2. You have to share your understanding and complete the Wednesday Lesson or Saturday Activity task before your next session and submit it before the session starts.
3. Between the Community Building and the School Project, you have to choose either one of them or both for the next 21 days and we will set the targets by 1st July, which you will be completing by the end of the 21 days. 

And last but not the least, you will have to come up with something which you think will make you stand out from the rest. It will be your best skill so you can discuss with me about this today over the Session.
30/06/23, 18:55 - Courtney EWYL23E0079: Oky Mr Maurice
01/07/23, 14:11 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self‚Äîthe person you aspire to be‚Äîand consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!

03/07/23, 14:14 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello Courtney!

03/07/23, 19:37 - Courtney EWYL23E0079: Good afternoon sir there's network error please
07/07/23, 15:06 - Courtney EWYL23E0079: This winter l was given an opportunity to study abroad in India üáÆüá≥ through Edoofa Scholarship Program. Throughout the month of June l have learned much about the program and myself as well. I have discovered that every opportunity immerse myself in any given culture to fully understand their lifestyle. Edoofa has inspired me to focus my efforts on the goals that I am supposed to achieve. This study abroad program has broadened my horizons and l am grateful for the opportunity

Of course, growing up comes with its own set of fears, the most common being fear of failure. If I let fear take over and refuse to use logical thinking, it will begin to hinder my success. It may cause me to take on the wrong mindset and try to become something I‚Äôm not. However, if I find people who have the same concerns that I do, we can help each other grow as people and eliminate our fears.
07/07/23, 17:31 - Jasmine Kaur: Dear proud EdooÔ¨Åan ,
