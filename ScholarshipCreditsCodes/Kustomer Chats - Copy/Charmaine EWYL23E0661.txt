02/10/23, 13:37 - Charmaine EWYL23E0661: Problem solving and critical thinking refers to the ability to use 
knowledge, facts, and data to effectively solve problems. This 
doesnâ€™t mean you need to have an immediate answer, it means 
you have to be able to think on your feet, assess problems and 
find solutions. The ability to develop a well thought out solution 
within a reasonable time frame, however, is a skill that 
employers value greatly.
02/10/23, 13:38 - Charmaine EWYL23E0661: This is what I learnt according to my understanding

04/10/23, 13:52 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofians,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning

05/10/23, 14:11 - Aditi Kapoor: It's great to hear about your aspirations for higher education and independence.
