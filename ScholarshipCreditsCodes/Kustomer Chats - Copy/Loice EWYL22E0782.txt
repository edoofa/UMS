Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

So to broaden the student community i intent to share  the Edoofa Schoolarship Program Application Forms to channels where students are mainly engaged with thus the social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.I have a strong believe that these sites will help broaden the student community as l will guide students and help them understand the amazing journey to becoming an edoofian and why is Edoofa the most preferred Schoolarship programme.

As a proud Edoofian,l can go as far as visiting the nearest schools and educate students along with the decision makers of the school about the Edoofa Schoolarship programme and how it helps them in pursuing their higher level career goals.

Also l can also share the Edoofa programme through business sites for example LinkedIn and Website Builder as this will catch the attention of influencial company owners  who can help in the development of students enrolling under the Edoofa Schoolarship Program.

Last week, we observed two offs, on Thursday on the eve of Republic Day, and on the 28th, Saturday.
Last week, I shared a special lesson with all my students but our project discussions finished late last Wednesday till that time, the lessons were already shared with the students and this weekend, I did not share any activity since I exclusively wanted to discuss with them the targets that they have set for themselves for the month of February.

31/01/23, 02:20 - Loice EWYL22E0782: Q1:Seke 5 High School


Q2:Greetings Mrs Mpala(the headmistress)

*l am Loice Masunda,a proud beneficiary of the Edoofa Schoolarship Programme*

Also l am a former student of Seke 5 High School and a *proud Edoofian*,l joined the Edoofa Schoolarship programme to further my studies abroad without the financial pressures  on me and my parents of fully funding my tuition fees full-time.Also to  help and increase my career opportunities as Edoofa gives me the edge to apply for jobs in India,United States,Kingdom and European Nations and enhancing my skill-set and networking due to mixing with people of different races,tribes and cultures.


Allow me to introduce the Edoofa Schoolarship Program which is a well appreciated *Indian* based programme in many African countries offering 50-100% schoolarships on tuition fees.Edoofa  makes education affordable and accessible to  advanced level students who are in preparation of their tertiary studies even before appealing for their exams.Pupils are given the opportunity to study abroad in any desired field of study.

So as a proud Edoofian im edging you to increase the opportunity to destination of your Advanced level students by also giving them an insight of the program and helping them apply!
