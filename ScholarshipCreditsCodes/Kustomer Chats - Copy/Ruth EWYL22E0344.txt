13/07/22, 19:01 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, im Ruth Mashasha and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Ruth EWYL22E0344
13/07/22, 19:15 - Unknown: Hello Ruth!
Now Ruth all our conversations will take place on the EWYL Line only.
13/07/22, 19:19 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Oh thats great
14/07/22, 18:36 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: \"Im a proud Edoofian\"
14/07/22, 18:38 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
14/07/22, 18:58 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Noted Mam.. I have great interest
15/07/22, 01:09 - Unknown: Hello my proud EDOOFIAN!

From his dad’s small foray into entrepreneurship, Patrice Motsepe got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe’s success story is a remarkable one showing how curiosity, doggedness, perseverance, and the knack to exploit great opportunities as they come, can determine how successful or not, any individual could become. 
And this was all about our WEDNESDAY WISDOM.
Hope you have gone through it.
I am so excited to listen to your thoughts and views here.
15/07/22, 05:50 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Good evening Mam
15/07/22, 05:50 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Well it is really a motivating story which brings out that for one to be successful he or she should have some certain qualities like
1 should be self motivated
2 devoted to his or he work
3 innocent
4 honesty
5 hard working
6 should be able to manage time 
and again it highlighted that for ones business to be successful the person has to  do a close monitoring

16/07/22, 05:24 - Unknown: Greetings Ruth!
16/07/22, 05:24 - Unknown: I read your response RUTH and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a WAY. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. We can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.
16/07/22, 05:31 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Im doing good how are you

18/07/22, 22:50 - Unknown: SWOT analysis might sound something complex but I am sure that while going through our weekend activity, you might have gone through what a SWOT means thoroughly and gained much knowledge on the same. The weekend activity asked us to draw a SWOT analysis of any company.
I want to share your response with me here Ruth.

20/07/22, 18:44 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Ok Mam so encouraging
20/07/22, 19:20 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: 1 You can use the following form to share the school details with me.



1) School Name: Tugwane High School 

2) Name of the contact person: Augustine Mashasha 

3) Designation of the contact person: Headmaster

4) Whatsapp Number: +263774698909

5) How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person? I get to know about the school through its yearly high 'A' and   'O' level results. Plus my father being the headmaster of the school I get to know it better. We discussed about the aims of Edoofa, the enrollment fee, registration fees, enrollment into suitable universities, the Earn While You Learn program and all the help and assistance that Edoofa gives to the students.

6) 
Year of the establishment of the School: 1981

The number of students in A level: 8

Fees structure in A level: $ 12000 ( Zimbabwean dollar)

Pass% of A level: 100%

No. of teachers in School: 27
20/07/22, 19:22 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: As for the call he said he can be connected  on Thursday
20/07/22, 21:40 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Ruth!
How are you doing today?
20/07/22, 21:41 - Unknown: Sorry for the delay caused in reverting to you actually I was not keeping well for past few days, sorry I couldn't inform that to you beforehand. But yes, I am well now and we can have our discussion now.
20/07/22, 21:46 - Unknown: I read your response Ruth and it made me so inquisitive to know about the cosmetic industry in Zimbabwe and look what I found  you look out there, here in Zimbabwe, you will notice an interesting trend. So many people are now vendors who specifically focus on just cosmetic products. The other day someone approached me selling body sprays and deodorants. What struck me was that most of their products were priced at just one US dollar. What also struck me is selling cosmetic products is their full-time hustle. The difference here is that they move around on foot selling their stuff. No wonder why starting a cosmetics shop business is bound to be profitable given how many people are surviving on elementary vending of cosmetic products.''
Your response was so elaborative and knowledgeable Ruth, well appreciated.
20/07/22, 21:49 - Unknown: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader. 
Also Ruth, along with the SWOT analysis of a company, I would appreciate it if you also share a SWOT analysis of yourself. I want to see how much more you have learned beyond this activity.
20/07/22, 21:50 - Unknown: I have noted your update on the school as well.
20/07/22, 21:54 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: I'm pretty good
20/07/22, 21:56 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Thank goodness you are now okay.. it's okay Mam juct don't worry yourself keep on recovering

21/07/22, 04:15 - Unknown: Thank you for all your warm prayers. I am getting better.
21/07/22, 04:16 - Unknown: As mentioned in my reply to your response Ruth, I would appreciate it if you could submit a SWOT analysis of yourself.
21/07/22, 16:27 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: \"Im a proud Edoofian\"
21/07/22, 16:27 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Good morning Mam

22/07/22, 00:25 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Ruth!
How's your day going?
22/07/22, 00:27 - Unknown: You have to submit a SWOT of yourself. I want to know Ruth's Strengths, Weaknesses, opportunities that you think you have, and Threats that you have to be beware of.
22/07/22, 00:35 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: It is a nice day indeed how are you
22/07/22, 00:38 - Unknown: I am doing great, thanks for asking.
22/07/22, 00:38 - Unknown: Along with this, let's move on with our session.
Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our WEDNESDAY Wisdom was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
3. swot of yourself
22/07/22, 00:47 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Ok Mam thanks for clarifying
22/07/22, 01:02 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Strengths
I'm very flexible
Hardworking
I have full faith and belief in my self
Honesty 

Weakness
Failing is my greatest weakness, also I'm a bit slow

Opportunities 
To be the most recognized laboratory technician
I want to build a Children's Home for all the children who are vulnerable in my community 

Threats 
Financial constraints due to the countries unstable economy
22/07/22, 01:29 - Unknown: This is so amazing Ruth that you have identified your weaknesses very well because I feel that a successful leader can identify their weakness and then holds so much power to overcome them through their strengths. I know you can so, you WON'T FAIL, I will always ensure that Ruth.
22/07/22, 01:29 - Unknown: Now we are left with:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
22/07/22, 04:55 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: 1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom

Well from the Wednesday wisdom I understand that it is necessary for anyone to do her work with perfection so that he or she achieves great things in life more over the power of hardworking proves that it always produces best results. I understand that as we are living we should leave the tendency of casting blames on others when we fail to achieve our goals because 
1. We will sometimes end up blaming the wrong people
2. Blame game does not help us in achieving anything
3. Blaming others shows that we can not carry our own responsibilities
22/07/22, 04:56 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: 2. As for project number 1 I have sent some text messages to the founder but I haven't yet received the replies
22/07/22, 05:00 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Here the understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
22/07/22, 05:35 - Unknown: I read your response Ruth and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
22/07/22, 05:35 - Unknown: What about other projects Ruth.
22/07/22, 05:39 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Thank you mam
22/07/22, 05:53 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Well for the project2 I'm going to go into the urban area since I stay in the rural area where very few people can afford the expenses needed tho they might want to be part of program

As for project 3 it happened that headmasters have been occupied with conferences and meetings so they were not at their respective schools but I want to believe starting next week I will be able to pay a visit to quite a number of schools
22/07/22, 17:02 - Unknown: Good morning Ruth!
How did your day go?
22/07/22, 17:06 - Unknown: For project 2, I suggest you can just give them (families in your area) the idea of what EDOOFA is all about and can get the interest forms filled. First, see the kind of response that you are getting from your nearby then move on to the urban area.
For project 3, you can get the forms filled by a vice deputy or vice head also, you can tell them what EDOOFA is all about and then you can get the forms filled by them. Later on, you can get us a meeting fixed with the headmaster. 
What do you think?
23/07/22, 05:38 - Unknown: Congratulations Ruth,?
Seeing your consistency in your sessions and responses, I recommended your name for the Project named  Deepali, our Department Head, and Ms. Sanjana, our Project Head were really impressed by your work so far and are looking forward to your performance in this project.✨
23/07/22, 05:38 - Unknown: I am sharing a document with you that has all the details mentioned in it. 
Go through it, twice at least. If you come across anything that you have difficulty in understanding, just let me know.
23/07/22, 05:39 - Unknown: RUTH  it is a great opportunity for you to outshine in the crowd of so many students. With this project, you get an opportunity not only to:
1) LEARN SKILLS 
- such as communication skills, creative writing, market research, etc. but also

2) EARN SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS 
- I know how eager you are to earn it.
25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

26/07/22, 18:43 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: GROWTH MINDSET:
 means thriving on challenges and don't see failure as a way to describe one's self but rather as a springboard for growth and developing abilities. Intelligence and talents are susceptible to growth by doing so one is able to achieve greater things in life. Growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your effort and hardworking. Successful people are people who are willing to give a try in all kinds of strategies and techniques because they know and have guys that they will eventually get them where they want to go. Positive and good results always comes after developing a positive mindset and attitude towards something. Having a positive mindset helps since it provides one with the foundation for resilience, motivation, and yes meaning in life. This keeps one focused so that he\/she don't get distracted or procrastinated. Moreover successful people are risk takers, risk taking helps in removing fear and gives a person courage. For one to have a growth mindset he\/she must improve skills with effort and practice for example reading and writing.
 
Steps need for one to develop a Growth mindset
Listen to the mindset voice inside of you
Recognize you have a choice that's either you choose to keep on working or you quit
Talk back with a growth mindset that's telling you self that no river is too wide for you to make a cross and no mountain is too high for you to climb
Practice
Find out help from others especially ideas
Stop seeking approval from others
Replace the word 'FAILURE'  with 'LEARNING' 
Take Growth mindset action
This helps one to be a successful someone so one has to fight to suppress a FIXED MINDSET which is a belief that one can not change his\/her talents, traits and basic abilities and get to work towards greater things.
26/07/22, 19:04 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Firstly I want to say I'm very happy that they arrived safely and you were able to meet them. The joy and happiness in their faces reviews a lot as it shows that they really know why they are in India and are ready to to start the big great journey. They might ve having a little fear in their hearts since most of them it's their first times to be in India but I want to believe it's juct the fear of the unknown. This is because I myself have true belief and faith in the Edoofa program and very proud to be an EDOOFIAN. I wish them a happy stay.

26/07/22, 19:48 - Unknown: Greetings Ruth!
I am doing great, thanks for asking.
26/07/22, 19:48 - Unknown: What happened to you?
26/07/22, 19:48 - Unknown: Did you take proper medicines or consult a doctor?
26/07/22, 19:49 - Unknown: I read your understanding of the activity Ruth and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it’s not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you’re looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don’t do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.
26/07/22, 19:49 - Unknown: I am so glad that you are happy about them.
26/07/22, 20:02 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: I had a serious heartburn

How are you?
I am doing well, thanks for asking.
13/10/22, 01:23 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian!
Hope you are doing well.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real-life example. That is how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because in the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.
Responses will be submitted on the EWYL Line only.

Happy Learning.

13/10/22, 23:12 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: From the Wednesday Wisdom I learnt that it is wise never to give up on things you want and even resources should never be a limit to your goals. It's good to be social media literate since this comes back to one as a benefit. In what ever way you do one should never forget his\/ her community and should work in a position to upgrade it.

HALL OF INSPIRATION
A big shout out yo brother Kudakwashe Quazana. I'm so happy for him for representing us the Africans on the World Tourism Day. From him he clearly indicated that taking part in extra curricular activities helps in building self-esteem, confidence, social skills and creates big and great networks.

20/10/22, 21:36 - Unknown: I am happy to see the video and I am very glad to receive this video from you.
Could you please share the video with me on the EWYL Group?
20/10/22, 21:37 - Unknown: I am having some errors while downloading the video.
20/10/22, 21:39 - Unknown: I am happy to tell you that this weekend we are having our great Indian festival, Deepawali and you know this festival holds a special place in the hearts of all Indian families. So yesterday, everyone in our office wore Ethnic dresses and celebrate Deepawali's party where we exchanged gifts and lit up the office with diyas and candles.
Due to this, there was a delay in sending you the Wednesday lesson for this week.
Please see to it and we will have a session tomorrow on the same because I want to give you time to ponder and work on it.
20/10/22, 21:39 - Unknown: In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

21/10/22, 22:47 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Wednesday Wisdom
The story was about humanity.. where I learnt about Mane a football player who is in a position to remember his community and always remembers where he comes from to an extent that for all the opportunities of life that he has he is making sure that his community benefits a lot. This is helping his community to be a better place and a favourable one.
21/10/22, 23:59 - Unknown: Greetings Ruth!
How are you?
21/10/22, 23:59 - Unknown: As I shared yesterday in our session today on the EWYL Line, we will be discussing two crucial things:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. what have you learned about the Deepawali festival so far :fireworks: 

I am excited to discuss both things with you!
21/10/22, 23:59 - Unknown: I read your response Ruth and I feel that the struggle exists to change us and our lives we struggle because it is the key to the path of our destination of what we want or what we want to become filled with challenges, knowledge, and so on. Without struggle, we humans won't be able to achieve what we have today.
We both have spoken on similar grounds and yes it was indeed a very inspiring tale.
22/10/22, 00:02 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: I'm fine thank you mam. How are you today
22/10/22, 00:03 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Yes indeed I felt that if all things goes well in my life i should put my community on the front line
22/10/22, 00:26 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Deepawali is a five day Holiday whereby the Hindus, jaines and Sikhs celebrate spiritual victory of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over ignorance. There is home decoration, shopping, family get-togethers, and fireworks during the 5day holiday. And people exchange gifts and sweets
22/10/22, 04:26 - Unknown: Yes, that's great Ruth.
It is a Hindu festival that marks the grand welcome of Lord Rama his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after long battle and hardships.
Moreover, the bigger significance that this festival taught me as a student and I want to teach you as well is that it marks the birth of a better version of ourselves, this day brings motivation to us to fight the evil in us and work for the best. It says aloud that, 'work hard, and struggle to strive for the good'.
Being your mentor, I want you to realize that you are made to do much bigger things in life and aim high. I want that you set aims in your life and work hard to achieve them.
Tell me, will you promise me that?
22/10/22, 04:30 - Ruth EWYL22E0344: Yes mam.. i promise
