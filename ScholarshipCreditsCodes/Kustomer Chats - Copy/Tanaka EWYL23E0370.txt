05/01/24, 22:51 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Evening
Let us start our session with a fun question

If your pet could suddenly talk for one day, what do you think they would say or ask you?
05/01/24, 22:53 - Tanaka EWYL23E0370: Give better food please
05/01/24, 22:54 - Jasmine Kaur: Haha, Why Tanaka. You don't give good food to your pet?
05/01/24, 22:55 - Tanaka EWYL23E0370: I give it food but that's the first thing that came to my mind
05/01/24, 23:01 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, dear. That is great. 

Now I am sure that you must have gone through the Wednesday Wisdom. 
Kindly go ahead share your lesson's understanding with me
05/01/24, 23:07 - Tanaka EWYL23E0370: Okay
05/01/24, 23:17 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes please
05/01/24, 23:29 - Tanaka EWYL23E0370: It is our space to learn skills lessons and experiences that are not in the syllabus and and also we develop skills that will aid us in becoming successful professionals,  participating in activities such as seminars and student events and also workshops is a valuable investment in personal and professional growth and by this students gain insights from industrial leaders and enhance their skills  . Me personally I liked the lesson on teamwork and leadership whereby taking an active role in planning and organizing student events develops leadership and organizational skills and this ensures the smooth execution of an event and also collaborative projects meaning that workshops usually involve collaborative projects that mimic real world scenarios, by learning to work effectively under team work
