14/07/22, 19:07 - Lloyd EWYL22E0396: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Lloyd Nkosinersisia Makombe and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is  Lloyd EWYL22E0396
14/07/22, 23:32 - Unknown: Hello Lloyd!
I welcome you here.
14/07/22, 23:33 - Lloyd EWYL22E0396: Thank you
15/07/22, 01:13 - Unknown: Please remember to follow the daily ritual of 'I am a proud EDOOFIAN' here.
15/07/22, 01:14 - Lloyd EWYL22E0396: Okay.. definitely will
15/07/22, 17:51 - Lloyd EWYL22E0396: I am a proud EDOOFIAN
15/07/22, 17:53 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

16/07/22, 05:25 - Unknown: Greetings Lloyd!
I am so happy to see you following our daily ritual so dedicatedly.
16/07/22, 05:26 - Unknown: I see you have typed 2, do you have any confusion as to who a proud edoofian is?
16/07/22, 05:27 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.

You types 3, may I know why?
18/07/22, 03:40 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”

I hope you are doing well.
SWOT analysis might sound something complex but I am sure that while going through our weekend activity, you might have gone through what a SWOT means thoroughly and gained much knowledge on the same. The weekend activity asked us to draw a SWOT analysis of any company.
I want to share your response with me here Lloyd.

Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

26/07/22, 18:22 - Unknown: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

Yesterday I had an amazing day. I went to the airport to receive all my proud Edoofians and I had tears in my eyes seeing their happiness and enthusiasm. I want you to look at it and share your thoughts with me.
26/07/22, 18:23 - Unknown: Along with this, we can have our missed session:
''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''

The weekend activity clearly talked about what are the growing mindsets of successful people. 
I would really appreciate it if you share your understanding with me on the same and what you think can take you to the top.
28/07/22, 05:29 - Lloyd EWYL22E0396: Right now I don't think I can really say exactly what kind of growing mindset a successful person should 
What I believe in is that one has to be able to give what ever goal he has all his\/her focus 
One should be able to understand that there is always a purpose or reason behind whatever that happens in life and be able to learn something from it 
They also view the world from a certain perspective in which they can learn something from a negative situation or viewing the glass as half full than half empty

29/07/22, 00:56 - Unknown: Greetings Lloyd!
How's your day going?
29/07/22, 00:58 - Unknown: I read your understanding of the weekend activity and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it’s not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you’re looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don’t do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.
29/07/22, 00:59 - Unknown: Along with this, let's have our session:
Time management is defined as using your time productively and efficiently—but what about when you are working as productively as possible, and you still can’t get everything done? It may be better to think about time management as a combination of working productively and prioritizing your time.

Our *Wednesday Wisdom* was all about Time Management and understanding the priority matrix to organize our tasks. 
I am really excited to hear your understanding and working on the same.
Please share it with me here.
In today's session we will talk about:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. progress on community building projects.
29/07/22, 05:05 - Lloyd EWYL22E0396: From the Wednesday lesson got to learn how to separate tasks that I have depending on urgency and importance 
Also got the difference between important and urgent 
Combining the priority matrix and your daily schedule has a great deal effect on time management
29/07/22, 17:55 - Lloyd EWYL22E0396: I am a proud edoofian
29/07/22, 17:57 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation.

30/07/22, 02:54 - Unknown: Good evening Lloyd!
How's your day going?
30/07/22, 02:56 - Unknown: Your response to the Wednesday wisdom has made me realize our childhood quote  is Money'.
Through Wednesday Wisdom, my main aim was to educate my Edoofians about TIME MANAGEMENT and HOW IT CAN BE ACHIEVED.
You know are very well aware of what Time management means, let me tell you about what Time Management includes:

#Effective Planning
# Setting goals and objectives
# Setting deadlines
# Delegation of responsibilities
# Prioritizing activities as per their importance
# Spending the right time on the right activity

The benefits of Time Management are:
- Time Management makes an individual punctual and disciplined.
- One becomes more organized as a result of effective Time Management.
- Individuals who stick to a time plan are the ones who realize their goals and objectives within the shortest possible period. 
- Research says that individuals who accomplish tasks on time are less prone to stress and anxiety. 

How can we achieve it:
# Set a goal for yourself.
# Priority matrix (like we talked about in the Wednesday lesson)
# Organize your study space
# Do a SWOT Analysis of yourself.

I am sure you will note all these things and imply in your day-to-day life and do share with me what changes you have felt.
30/07/22, 02:56 - Unknown: Along with this, I am very happy to see your understanding of our daily ritual.
30/07/22, 02:57 - Lloyd EWYL22E0396: Good evening

07/08/22, 04:20 - Unknown: Reading your response Lloyd filled me with so much fire, passion, and motivation. It got reminded me of one quote:
“If you want to be happy the whole life, tie it to a goal, not people or objects.”

This was the quotation given by Alert Einstein and the quote which defines a goal.
Through this lesson, my main motive was to teach you that sacrifices are required to achieve the main target, and achievement of those important aims is necessary.
Those aims are:
1. Analysis of my strength and weaknesses – because this analysis will let me know how to work on both to make my strength more powerful and convert my weakness into my strength.
2. To be a good person and love yourself – To get positive vibes one should work on herself\/himself because “when you see yourself, with eyes full of love and acceptance, you hold space for others to meet you at your highest self “(by Karly Ryan).
3. Never regret any past decision – “Every bad decision gives you a lesson and this makes one’s vision more clear towards the achievement of its goal” as it is said by a great personality that takes responsibility and initiative for yourself stop blaming your circumstances for what you can change.
4. Always give 100% – there is a frame on my living room wall, of Swami Vivekananda that always gives me motivation the quotation written in it says “Arise, awake, and do not stop until the goal is reached”.
07/08/22, 04:20 - Unknown: I would like to share something about my goals.
My goals also consist of making my parents proud of their daughter, a daughter that will give them a more comfortable life, one that is not filled with such pain. Indeed, I cannot deny that truly I am not experienced as much as some people, but at least for me, every milestone in my life is an emblem of my growth. When I can complete something new successfully or learn something from my failure instead of complaining, I think I have grown up.

10/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Lloyd when I reviewed our previous talk, I was ecstatic to see how sincerely you had been practicing the ritual for the past week of remembering what it means to be a proud Edoofian.

2. make weekly plans on achieving targets on three ongoing projects.
10/08/22, 22:21 - Lloyd EWYL22E0396: After reading some articles on Gilbert , I have picked up some of the traits that led to his success like the way he was able to see and act on the rising demands for faster advertising and designing services in the marketing industry
Being able to spot an opportunity and seizing it with all you have , I believe that is one of the traits successful people have.
From the articles I could tell he's an ambitious hard worker, from how he began doing small projects just after his ordinary level , not siting idly but rising to fulfill his dreams.
Also he did not let the drop in demand for satellite  installments stop him from moving forward and investing on a new project which today has made him one of the most successful Zimbabweans
11/08/22, 00:42 - Unknown: Due to some medical emergency, I would not be able to take your session today.
But, nothing to worry about, I will do better after some time.
And by the time we have our next scheduled session, I want you to keep following the proud edoofian ritual.
Till then, have a great day.​
​And yes, we have our cultural festival tomorrow, named Raksha Bandhan. I want you to search for it, and if it gains your interest, we will surely discuss it in our next session.

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time.

12/08/22, 19:31 - Unknown: Greetings Lloyd!
How's your day going?
12/08/22, 19:32 - Unknown: So yes, did you do a quick research about Raksha Bandhan?
You know I had an amazing day yesterday. I am very excited to tell you how it all went.
First I put a red spot on my brother's forehead, it is called 'teeka'. Then we stick some rice to that spot and after that, I tied a beautiful decorative rakhi (a thread or ribbon) on this wrist.
Sisters do that for the long life of their brothers and to that, the brothers promise to protect their sisters.
Later we have delicious sweets and exchanged presents. :gift-box:
12/08/22, 19:32 - Unknown: Along with this, since our session was scheduled yesterday, and we had our festival, so we would have our session tomorrow in the missed session. Till that time, 
1. keep following the proud edoofian ritual
2. your understanding of the Wednesday lesson
15/08/22, 21:35 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

16/08/22, 00:37 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
