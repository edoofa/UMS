02/11/22, 21:41 - Mellisa EWYL22E0513: Great and you?
02/11/22, 21:43 - Tenzin: I am doing great as well! Thank you for asking. So would you please share your experience of Edoofa with me?
02/11/22, 21:46 - Mellisa EWYL22E0513: I experienced that tertiary education is made easier with Edoofa.Students are offered scholarship credits through the EWYL programme which will further reduce their university fees.Moreover the EWYL program helps one to acquire skills and to be aware of how business are changing and also instill online and social media literacy.So there are also skills that are needed like decision making and risk taking.
02/11/22, 21:51 - Tenzin: Glad to hear that Mellisa! So, did you start working on the projects we discussed?
02/11/22, 21:51 - Mellisa EWYL22E0513: Not yet
02/11/22, 21:52 - Mellisa EWYL22E0513: My exams are still on going so I'm always busy
02/11/22, 21:52 - Mellisa EWYL22E0513: I will be free after 24 November
02/11/22, 21:52 - Tenzin: I understand that Mellisa! So, from when should we start working on the projects?
02/11/22, 21:53 - Mellisa EWYL22E0513: From 24 November please
02/11/22, 22:05 - Tenzin: Ok Mellisa! But until that, I want you to follow the Proud Edoofian Ritual whole heartedly and every day, and at least attend the lessons and activities that I share.
02/11/22, 22:06 - Mellisa EWYL22E0513: No problem ,I will gladly do that
02/11/22, 22:09 - Tenzin: Great! And in the meanwhile, I want to correct you a bit, I have noticed that you have been sending the Proud Edoofian text wrong, I want you to analyse the mistake that you must have been making and get back to me with your findings.
02/11/22, 22:09 - Mellisa EWYL22E0513: Okay
02/11/22, 22:11 - Mellisa EWYL22E0513: I should pass my greetings first then say I am a proud Edoofian
02/11/22, 22:12 - Mellisa EWYL22E0513: Edoofian and not Edoofan
02/11/22, 22:12 - Tenzin: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

02/11/22, 22:18 - Mellisa EWYL22E0513: It makes us feel like we are part of something bigger and installs a sense of pride in us
02/11/22, 22:22 - Tenzin: Great! It instills recognition, pride, and honor. But at the same time also teaches you to be humble and helpful.
02/11/22, 22:22 - Mellisa EWYL22E0513: Yes
02/11/22, 22:25 - Tenzin: Great! I guess this should be enough for today, the Wednesday lesson shall be shared with you in some time, I want you to go through it, and learn as much as possible. We shall discuss the same in our later sessions.
02/11/22, 22:25 - Mellisa EWYL22E0513: Alright,thank you
02/11/22, 22:25 - Mellisa EWYL22E0513: Have a good day
02/11/22, 23:23 - Tenzin: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We all have come across the quote, \"Quitters Never Win, and Winners Never Quit\", and we also must have experienced this in our lives, directly or indirectly.

If last week's lesson, taught you the mindset of a winner, this week's lesson is going to teach you the true nature of a winner. Someone, who never gives up, or quits on the dream they see and really want to fulfill, no matter what. Moving through scorching heat, drenching rains, and heavy snow, they reach their destination and complete their journey. In this lesson, you will also learn, what happens when an entire community inherits this trait and keeps working on it. How recognition is earned and respect is gained through time, patience, and endless efforts.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.
02/11/22, 23:43 - Mellisa EWYL22E0513: Thank you so much

05/11/22, 21:42 - Tenzin: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian!

“My job is not to be easy on people. My job is to make them better.”- Steve Jobs

And till now, our founder Mr. Angad has always been a guiding light for everyone at Edoofa. And has made sure we all turn out to be future leaders in our fields, no matter how hard it seems, we should keep moving with single harmony toward our goals and motives. But, leadership can not only be taught, as it is not a literary subject, but a practical life experience that is to be taken up and practiced and bettered with each passing day.

Hence, after the very encouraging Wednesday lesson on how good leadership and patience can change the entire ideology and perception of a community to grow back from the ashes. Today's Activity is going to give you a first-hand experience to fit yourselves in a small part of the leadership shoes. I want you to create a newsletter of your own. Similar to the ones you have enjoyed reading every Sunday from the founder's office.

Your Newsletter should consider the following things:  Quotes that have been motivating you for some time now, or your three favorite quotes which motivate you to be better every day.
and,
2. One story of your idol, that can be any person, who according to you has contributed to making the community and world a better place for people to live. The story should also consist of a part stating the reason why they are your idol.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own capabilities while performing this activity.

The best newsletters of the week shall be shared with all the fellow edoofians next week.

Have a wonderful weekend ahead.
05/11/22, 22:11 - Tenzin: The deadline for the submission of this newsletter is 12 pm Zimbabwe Time Monday.
