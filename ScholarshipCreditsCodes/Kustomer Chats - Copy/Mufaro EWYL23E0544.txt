I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL

06/12/23, 15:43 - Mufaro EWYL23E0544: Góod morning.I am Mufaro Tabeni.I am proud to be an Edoofian.

Question 1...I totally agree with Henry Ford's school of thought that" offer value before asking for value".I have lived in a society where people want to gain without working for it.As a student of Edoofa,I should show my society what I can add or do to them through my education in India.The society must witness my contribution as an individual to my community or country or team.Thereafter I can look back and  assure myself that if value or benefits for my achievements can come my way,I will gladly accept it.This is because society should see work/achievements I would have done.Good work or deeds should come after hard work.
06/12/23, 16:46 - Aditi Kapoor: Your perspective on Henry Ford's philosophy resonates strongly with the values we uphold in Edoofa. Demonstrating your commitment to offering value before expecting rewards is crucial, especially in a society where shortcuts are often sought. Your dedication to showcasing what you can contribute through your education in India is commendable. It aligns perfectly with the Edoofa ethos of creating positive impacts as individuals in our communities, countries, and teams. Your willingness to accept value and benefits only after demonstrating your achievements reflects a genuine and principled approach. Society recognizing your hard work and accomplishments as the basis for rewards is a powerful testament to the importance of diligence and dedication. Keep up the great mindset and continue to inspire others with your commitment to hard work and positive contributions!
06/12/23, 17:06 - Mufaro EWYL23E0544: Thank you very much for your profound analysis of my answer to 1st question.
06/12/23, 19:24 - Mufaro EWYL23E0544: Good afternoon. Question 2... If I apply the principle of"offering value before asking for it",  there are results or outcomes that go it. It is my strong belief that if I work hard and do my work well then the results will be positive. Results will be incremental-from being small to being big and benefits will eventually build up themselves. As Tawananyasha Nkomo a proud Edoofian wrot:If things tough you have to go tougher. Equally with me, I need to be strong and reach my goals. I need to define who I am.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

12/12/23, 14:57 - Mufaro EWYL23E0544: Good morning.

What I understood on the use of Excel is to calculate the average  amount of time spent on different activities in my daily routine. Well I will startby setting up a spreadsheet with a list of all activities that I typically do in a day. Then I would assign  a time to each activity by estimating the amount of time spent.

Finally, l would use the AVERAGE function in Excel to calculate the average time spent on each activity.This will give me a clear picture of how I spend my time each day and where I could potentially make changes to my routine.

I am a PROUD EDOOFIAN.
