15/07/23, 12:13 - Ananya: Great, so may I ask how is your phone now?
15/07/23, 12:15 - Thubalami Temp: I am currently still using my mom's phone ,but beginning the next week ,l will try to find another phone to be using ,so that l can access my EWYL contacts
15/07/23, 12:15 - Ananya: That is alright, so may I ask if you are doing good with you projects?
15/07/23, 12:18 - Thubalami Temp: Had gone to two schools to speak to the people in authority, this previous week and the coming week ,it's examination week ,so they are usually busy  invigilating , but will definitely find time to go back and try reaching out to them again
15/07/23, 12:20 - Thubalami Temp: As for students,l was still receiving forms ,from students who want to go 2025 ,for the upper six's that will be going next year ,are still busy with their mock exams,so the timing is what is not good
15/07/23, 12:20 - Ananya: You know you can emphasize on the perks of being connected with Edoofa:

Schools can be benefited in the following way:
1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‚ÄòA-Level‚Äô/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(PHD.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
15/07/23, 12:27 - Thubalami Temp: Okay , ma'am
I hear you,
The only limiting factor is that ,they don't have free time these days , because of their ongoing examinations
15/07/23, 12:28 - Thubalami Temp: Most students are writing exams , especially the required students into the program
15/07/23, 12:38 - Ananya: Yes, I understand. You know what you should do, you can just ask them about the details required in the form and fill it by your own. Don't leave it on them.
15/07/23, 12:38 - Thubalami Temp: Okay , ma'am
Will definitely do that ma'am
15/07/23, 12:39 - Ananya: Yes, This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success
‚ñ™Ô∏èVisiting schools physically can put a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, leadership quality, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear to present himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.
15/07/23, 12:39 - Ananya: .
15/07/23, 12:43 - Thubalami Temp: Okay ma'am
15/07/23, 12:46 - Ananya: Do you know why I am sharing this with you? It's because I know you have this capability within you, and I want to use your example to inspire my other students next time.
15/07/23, 12:47 - Thubalami Temp: Okay ma'am, thank you,for your kind words
15/07/23, 12:49 - Ananya: You know you are there for just a month, and I would recommend you visit as many schools as possible and earn credits, as after coming to India it is going to be difficult for you to connect with schools.
15/07/23, 12:49 - Thubalami Temp: Yes ma'am, l understand
15/07/23, 12:55 - Ananya: Great, I want you to try your best. Now let us connect in our next session. Happy weekend and all the best!
