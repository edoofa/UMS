Before we begin, I would like you to explain our *Program Structure* Please go ahead.
08/11/23, 01:13 - Nokutenda EWYL23E0824: Okay so the program serves a link between us the students, councilor, mentor and parents associate. Every school is highly to associate with Edoofa because of its student community's shared love and passion. We all work hard to gather so that we can grow all together. You get satisfied when us the students express joy through newsletter, social media and recognition by our peers. The most successful leaders practice sharing positive affirmations and you decide to make this an international day to day practice since we are connected to mentors (like you) 3 to 4 times a week. We want to have a connection where we can all celebrate our status and being members of this community of ambitious people. By all this I'm very proud to be an Edoofian
08/11/23, 16:02 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

18/11/23, 14:49 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!

11/12/23, 22:03 - Nokutenda EWYL23E0824: As students we must learn skills , lessons and experiences to get more creative and know our true selves this enables us to become successful professionals in our journeys. Microsoft excel is a spreadsheet software that is used in many areas like business, finance and academics. If we know the basics of excel as the students can be able to have proper data organization since college life involves managing larg amounts of data such as class schedules, assignments deadlines and grades. Exam can be used to trace all this. Again it can be used graphs and charts for presentations Easley as it can create visually appealing charts and graphs for class projects. Again it enhances critical thinking and problem solving since excel requires logic thinking and problem solving skills. It's helpful in real life as it produces students that are very organized and plan profetionaly made presentations
