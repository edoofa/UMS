17/12/22, 00:41 - Alouis EWYL22E0462: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Alouis Mutengwa and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Alouis EWYL22E0462
17/12/22, 00:42 - Alouis EWYL22E0462: I'm a proud EDOOFIAN.
17/12/22, 00:43 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
17/12/22, 00:44 - Alouis EWYL22E0462: Thank you.

22/12/22, 22:33 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian!
Hope you are doing well.

I know I have been quite inactive with our interactions over the past few days. With the new year coming, the whole team has gathered together to discuss some new year resolutions and opportunities that we can bring for you so that you grow tremendously. I want to assure you that I am always here for you and am always working hard along with you so that we make up the best team.

I hope you understand it.
22/12/22, 22:38 - Alouis EWYL22E0462: Alright
22/12/22, 22:41 - Unknown: May I know Alouis, on which project will you be working in the month of January?
22/12/22, 22:42 - Alouis EWYL22E0462: Community building I presume
22/12/22, 22:42 - Alouis EWYL22E0462: When can I submit this
22/12/22, 22:42 - Unknown: May I know how have you started to work on it?
22/12/22, 22:44 - Alouis EWYL22E0462: Right now I'm gathering student groups on whatsapp.....after that I plan to create a group through which all interested students can join.

23/12/22, 22:59 - Unknown: Greetings Alouis!
How are you?
23/12/22, 22:59 - Unknown: I am very happy to see you following the daily ritual with so much consistency.
23/12/22, 23:00 - Unknown: Along with this may I know what are your views on the Wednesday lesson and have you created the group by now?
23/12/22, 23:30 - Alouis EWYL22E0462: 1. In a few years I will be alumni of Edoofa. So as someone who once got educated through Edoofa, I think giving back to Edoofa would be best. I will help Edoofa establish more campuses financially. If it is possible it would be best to establish Edoofa campuses in countries like USA which offer very good education. 

2. We are advancing into a digital word. I would like to broaden Edoofa community by broadening the minds of fellow Edoofians through exposing them to a digital and technological. If I become successful enough, I wish to donate laptops to every freshman of Edoofa community so that they get used to perform functions like Excel, Word, Spreadsheet etc.
3. Edoofa has counselors who guide students in choosing careers, which is very important, because a lot of careers are being phased out so having such counselors will help students have stable careers. But I think it's also best for students to at least visit places where their careers are recognised. This will help them appreciate what they want to do before they even get into college. Students should learn that life isn't all about having a high paying job but rather doing something you love and enjoy the most. Adopting such a practical approach will prevent students from studying certain programs because of their salaries but help Edoofians to study certain programs because they enjoy them and feel the need to make this world a better place.
23/12/22, 23:31 - Alouis EWYL22E0462: Wednesday lesson????
23/12/22, 23:32 - Alouis EWYL22E0462: No I haven't. I'm hoping to do that after Christmas.
24/12/22, 22:22 - Unknown: Greetings _my Proud Edoofian_!

The holiday season is upon us and it’s time to light up the Christmas trees and indulge ourselves in the festivities. I assume due to the Christmas and New year seasons everyone is in a buoyant mood?

 Well, then I implore you to avail this time to spend with your family and friends. We are announcing holidays from today, 24th December 2022 to till 2nd January 2023. You are required to report on 3rd January 2023. ? 
Go out with friends to parties, eat with no concern, go to a church or set up Christmas at your home. Have a Christmas and New Year of your desire. Then come back with much more energy as your EWYL team has planned a very fruitful year ahead of you.

Many more projects, more skills to master, more exposure to new companies, more knowledge, and more surprises. :gift-box:
