12/01/24, 14:36 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Leiann!
How are you?
12/01/24, 14:36 - Saloni Rastogi: üåü *Are you ready to embark on this exciting journey? Let's dive into our daily ritual and important topics for our session!* üåü
12/01/24, 14:36 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) *Daily Morning Ritual:* Each day, we'll kick things off by saying, "I am a proud Edoofian" on the EWYL Line every morning. üåÑ Let's remember that being an Edoofian means being a strong advocate for positive change, focused on self-improvement, and dedicated to making our families proud. The sky's the limit for us as true Edoofians! üöÄ
12/01/24, 14:37 - Leiann EWYL23E0191: I am fine
12/01/24, 14:37 - Leiann EWYL23E0191: Sure let's do that
12/01/24, 14:37 - Saloni Rastogi: 2) *Program Structure and Agenda*


# Since your sessions are on *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:00-01:30 PM*, this is how your week will roll on:

# Monday to Sunday, that is all seven days, you have to follow the daily ritual. Here are specific guidelines for each day:


*Tuesday* - We will have our session from 12:00-01:30 PM where we will discuss your Saturday activity task, and then we will discuss how we can accelerate our performance on projects.

*Wednesday* - You will be shared with Wednesday Wisdom (or our weekly lesson)

*Friday* -  We will have our session from 12:00-01:30 PM where we will discuss your Wednesday lesson understanding, and then we will discuss how we can accelerate our performance on projects.

*Saturday* - You will be shared with Saturday activity (or weekly activity)
12/01/24, 14:39 - Leiann EWYL23E0191: Wow that's a pretty organised scheduleüòÅ
12/01/24, 15:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Indeed it is!
12/01/24, 15:43 - Saloni Rastogi: So, out of the three projects, I want to inform you that the first project is on hold due to some internal development. So we have an opportunity to work on two projects that is:
- Community Building Project
- African School Reform Mission Project

We will begin by knowing what is your basic understanding of the two projects, starting with the community building project.
12/01/24, 15:50 - Leiann EWYL23E0191: So basically community building project is a project that involves one getting in touch with fellow students who aspire to be proud Edoofians and then create a group for them so that they will apply.


African School Reform Mission Project is a project whereby a student gets to get connected with school heads via whatsapp and inform them about Edoofa and then try to arrange a meeting with the School heads and the Edoofa director with the help of my counsellor .
12/01/24, 15:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

12/01/24, 15:51 - Leiann EWYL23E0191: Before we continue may l ask. Is this Ms  Saloni?
12/01/24, 15:56 - Saloni Rastogi: So Leiann, whenever you will say 'I am a proud edoofian', you will receive an automated message from our end that will mark your attendance but it is always me on this end.
12/01/24, 15:58 - Saloni Rastogi: So Leiann, I am impressed with your understanding of the two projects and we will start by knowing the ways on how you can work on the community building project and how are you applying them now?
12/01/24, 16:00 - Leiann EWYL23E0191: Alright l will
12/01/24, 16:01 - Leiann EWYL23E0191: For now l have been posting my link to various groups inorder for people to join the group and sometimes l personally contact the students for those with queries
12/01/24, 16:57 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know if you have formed the WhatsApp group that we talked of?
12/01/24, 16:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for the delay Leiann, I sent a message but due to network challenges, it got failed to be delivered at your end.
12/01/24, 16:58 - Leiann EWYL23E0191: Yes l did
12/01/24, 16:58 - Leiann EWYL23E0191: It's alright l totally understand that
12/01/24, 16:59 - Saloni Rastogi: So for community building:
1) Keep the group updated DAILY.
2) Try reaching out to students from different schools
3) Try reaching out to teachers from your school or others and ask them to share the link to your WhatsApp group with other school teachers from different schools
4) In the group just:
-please give 'only admins' access
-just ask the students/participants to DM you to know about Edoofa and to get the form
-once they DM you, share about Edoofa with them
-Before sharing the form, ask them to get you added to their school groups
-once they do that, then only share the form with them.‚Äã
‚Äã5) Use social media as your sword to tell people about Edoofa
6) Use Facebook groups, I am sharing a screenshot that will help you understand that there are various scholarship groups on Facebook that you can join and share information about Edoofa also forward the link to your WhatsApp group there.
