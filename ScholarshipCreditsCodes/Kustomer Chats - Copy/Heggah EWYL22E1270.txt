06/03/23, 19:25 - Heggah EWYL22E1270: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Heggah  and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Heggah EWYL22E1270

06/03/23, 19:29 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

06/03/23, 23:34 - Heggah EWYL22E1270: Q1. Cornerstone Senior School. Im not sure.
Q2. Greetings to you sir or madam. I hope I find you well I'm doing well myself thank you.
I'm Heggah Mutsanuri a former student of Cornerstone Senior School who would want to share with you interesting news about the Edoofa program which helps students with their international education 

Q3. Harare
06/03/23, 23:42 - Saloni Rastogi: It is not connected.
06/03/23, 23:43 - Heggah EWYL22E1270: I don't understand
06/03/23, 23:44 - Saloni Rastogi: I mean to say that your school is not connected with Edoofa.
06/03/23, 23:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Proud Edoofian, today, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
06/03/23, 23:44 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead tomorrow.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him\/her for your School Head’s Contact.
06/03/23, 23:45 - Heggah EWYL22E1270: Okay
06/03/23, 23:45 - Heggah EWYL22E1270: That's great
07/03/23, 00:09 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized
07/03/23, 00:09 - Saloni Rastogi: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.



So, This is what the First message should look like:
07/03/23, 00:09 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Mr.\/Mrs *School Head Name*
