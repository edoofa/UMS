Let us discuss both these in our upcoming session.
30/09/23, 16:57 - Unknown: Dear Zvikomborero,

As we approach the upcoming exam period, it is crucial to ensure that you are well-prepared not only academically but also in terms of time management and maintaining effective communication with your mentors. To facilitate this process, we kindly request all students to submit their time management strategies and plans for maintaining constant communication with mentors during the exam period.
Your submitted strategies will not only help you stay on track during the exam period but also enable your mentors to provide you with the support and guidance you need.
We appreciate your proactive approach to effective time management and mentor communication during this crucial time. Your success is our priority, and we are here to support you every step of the way.

Best regards,
TEAM EWYL
30/09/23, 18:47 - Zvikomborero EWYL23E0380: . First, setting goals is key to effective time management. It's important to set SMART goals, which are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This will help me to focus on the most important tasks and break them down into smaller, more manageable steps. Prioritizing tasks is also important. I can use the Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, to identify the 20% of tasks that will yield 80% of the results. The second time management strategy is creating a schedule. A good way to do this is by using the time blocking method. This involves breaking my day into blocks of time and allocating specific tasks to each block. For example, i can block out an hour in the morning for studying, two hours in the afternoon for meetings like the EWYL meeting, and an hour in the evening for exercise. This will help me to stay on track and avoid getting distracted by other tasks. Third, taking breaks is essential to maintain focus and productivity. i Try to take a break every 90 minutes to give my brain a chance to recharge The fourth strategy is the Pomodoro technique. This involves setting a timer for 25 minutes and working on a task without any distractions during that time. When the timer goes off, i take a short break, and then start the timer again for the next work session. This technique helps me to keep myself focused and prevents myself from getting overwhelmed by a task. It also helps to make the most of the time i have available, since i.m  not wasting any time by switching tasks or getting distracted. After my Pomodoro sessions, i can take a longer break, like 15 or 30 minutes.

I hope you are doing well.

I went through the Saturday activity that you submitted, and I must say that your answer is bang on.
I enjoyed reading your strategy and the way you have broken down things like priority tasks and you also wrote about the focus on one task.
Keep implementing the same strategy in your real life as well and I am sure you will do wonders.
04/10/23, 13:11 - Unknown: Hello Zvikomborero,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning

I hope you are doing well.
It has been long since we last connected. I wanted to know that if you are not able to manage the EWYL sessions with your ongoing examinations then do let me know about the same.

In this scenario, I will share a basic procedure with you and through that we will be able to put your EWYL Program on Hold until your exams will get over.
This will ensure that you are having the undivided focus on your exams, and we will resume the EWYL Program exactly from where we left off when your exams will get over.

Do let me know if you want to put your sessions on hold or not.
18/10/23, 14:19 - Unknown: I wanted to let you know that today's Wednesday lesson is going to be a special one. We'll be delving into a captivating story that revolves around the themes of skill, hard work, and determination.

The moral of this story is a powerful one, and it's a lesson that we can carry with us throughout our lives: "Sometimes the truest treasures lay not in the allure of gold but in the craftsmanship and effort one invests in their work." This story will remind us of the value of dedication and the importance of striving for excellence in everything we do.

So, come prepared to listen, learn, and be inspired by this tale of determination and the rewards it can bring. We'll discuss the story, its characters, and the valuable lesson it imparts.

See you in our upcoming session, and let's explore the world of skill, hard work, and the true treasures that lie within our reach.

Best regards,
Team EWYL!
