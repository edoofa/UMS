10/03/23, 18:21 - Aditi Kapoor: The scholarship credits that you can earn from this project are a total of $20, which you will get when you complete each and every task every day successfully. In the worst-case scenario, if you are not able to complete the task given to you before the deadline due to *a genuine* reason, you will *only* be given the credits for the tasks you have accomplished, so make sure not to miss out on any task to attain the maximum credits from this project.

10/03/23, 18:33 - Aditi Kapoor: No, Assignment 1 and 2 combined makes up the 20$.
10/03/23, 18:34 - Lorraine EWYL22E1245: Okay
10/03/23, 18:35 - Aditi Kapoor: See this is one of the easiest projects that can be made because students don't have to travel and invest a single penny for this project.

10/03/23, 18:55 - Aditi Kapoor: No dear, Credits are transferred only when the project is completed by the student. If the student performs well, we give them more projects in the future that will easily help them to earn credits.
10/03/23, 18:55 - Aditi Kapoor: I am sharing the tasks now.
