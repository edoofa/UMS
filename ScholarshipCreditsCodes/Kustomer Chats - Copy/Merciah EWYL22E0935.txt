I am eager to learn how you want to ring in the new year and enjoy Christmas this year❄️????

22/12/22, 04:55 - Jasmine Kaur: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Make sure you are able to self-finance your higher education here in India!. For that, Let us start with a smaller target of earning between $30-$50 per month and as we increase our earnings, We will keep increasing this target as well
3. And ensure that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world, workplace and help you grow holistically which we will do by judiciously making use of the lessons and activities
03/01/23, 23:27 - Jasmine Kaur: Also, I wanted to inform you that we won’t be having any sessions Today.

Please let me know if you have any doubts regarding our session timings.

Also, feel free to share any queries that you have, We will be discussing them in our next session.
Have a cheerful day ahead!
04/01/23, 23:08 - Jasmine Kaur: *Wednesday Lesson | 4 Jan*

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy learning.
