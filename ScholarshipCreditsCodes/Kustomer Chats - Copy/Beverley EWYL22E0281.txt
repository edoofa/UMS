Some skills or practices that a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits include critical thinking,creativity and collaboration.

One of the skills that a student must uphold is critical thinking.Critical thinking is whereby one has to find solutions to problems.It help us as students to figure out stuff for ourselves when we do not have  teachers to help us out with our projects.

 Another skill that a student must uphold is creativity.This skill empowers students to see concepts in a different dimension and this will help them overcome difficult challenges.It allows students to bring in more ideas which will help them tackle their earn while you learn projects.

Lastly,collaboration is also another skill that a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects.Collaboration means working together to achieve the best possible results from solving challenging tasks.Therefore students have to work together to earn more scholarship credits.

13/07/22, 00:08 - Beverley EWYL22E0281: There's my *Wednesday Wisdom* assignment.

One learning l had from the inspirational story of Oluwadamilola Soyombo and Skooqs is that one mustn't give up.

This is shown when Oluwadamilola was given two options where the first option she had to come up with a for-profit idea within 5 days and if they loved it she was going to proceed in the program, or the second one where they were going to end the conversation.Surprisingly, Dami did not end there,she  took up the challenge with her team, mentors, friends,advisors and prayers and were able to come up with Skooqs.She didn't give up on her dreams.

15/07/22, 16:22 - Beverley EWYL22E0281: *Wednesday Wisdom*

From the story of Patrice Motsepe,I have learnt that one's past cannot define their future.Despite growing up from a poor background,Patrice managed to study hard enough to become a lawyer.No matter where one come from in terms of economic stability there is no limit to the heights you can achieve.Therefore one has to remember that the sky is the limit just like Patrice Motsepe.

Moreso,l have learnt to take up challenges.Despite being born in poverty,Patrice never looked down.To have achieved such success it means he faced so many challenges.Quitting is not an option if one really wants to be successful in life.One must not give up to achieve greater things. We have to view problems as challenges and make it an opportunity to achieve greatness.
15/07/22, 18:13 - Unknown: Good Morning, Beverley ?

Proud Edoofians, These are the footsteps that we have to follow. The traits that he gained and possessed are not something that could be taught in schools\/ universities.

The fast growing sector in Zimbabwe is the agricultural sector.

There is the agricultural extension service providers who brings the farming community information and new technologies that can be adopted to improve production, incomes and standards of living.

Therefore there are many categories of the extension service providers such as public\ragricultural extension service providers and public research organizations,international and private research centres and farmers’ associations.

 The SWOT analysis of the agricultural extension service providers goes like this, under public\ragricultural extension service providers and public research organizations there are some strengths which include highly qualified, competent and experienced personnel.The job requires very skilled people. 

There are some weaknesses such as\rlimited financial resources,where more than 75 percent of budget goes on salaries and very little left will go to\roperational costs.This leads to poor production of the business.\r
\r\r
Adding on,bureaucracy and long channels of communication is also a weakness of public agricultural extension service providers.Decision making tends to be long as there are long channels of communication.
\r
Some of the opportunities of the public agricultural extension service includes improved collaboration and efficiency through department \r
mergers.When departments merge,there is sharing of ideas on how to grow the business.This will lead to the growth of the business.

The threats of the public agricultural extension service providers are as follows,inadequate budgets are declining in real terms (inflation).Inflation is whereby money loses its value and there is an increase in the general level of prices.This will lead to unemployment as inflation rises.

23/07/22, 00:14 - Beverley EWYL22E0281: *Wednesday Wisdom* 

 From the passage,l heard that successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something but they accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes and then do something about it.So l learnt that one must learn from his mistakes to achieve greater things in life.

Moreso,if one wants to achieve something in life, he must work. As a wise man once said,\"hardwork pays off.\" We have to be positive and we must stay focused and remain determined to achieve greatness.
23/07/22, 18:53 - Unknown: Good Morning, Proud Edoofian ?
I hope that you are doing well

25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

The growth mindset of successful people embraces challenges and avoids challenges to achieve their goals. They give in when they come up against hardship,believe that people can increase their intelligence or skills, believe that intelligence and skills are something you’re born with and can’t develop.It is also inspired and motivated by the success of others. The growth mindset of successful people is threatened by the success of others. Successful people wants to learn and they believe they know everything already. They accept and embrace criticism.For me to develop such mindset,l will have to put myself in challenging new situations so that l gain confidence by overcoming those challenges.Moreso, l will have to think of failure as a learning opportunity so that l will find it easier to take risks.Futhermore,l will have to surround myself with talented people who can teach me new things and who can encourage me to grow personally and professionally.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

Procrastination makes easy things hard and hard things harder.

I believe that you would also agree with this, right?

13/10/22, 21:41 - Unknown: I noticed that you have not submitted the Saturday’s Activity yet. The deadline for that was Tuesday 6 PM but I gave you a leeway. Due to the delay, You also missed out on the Wednesday lesson that I was not able to share with you due to the pending last two submissions.

Today, At all costs, I would need the submission for the Last week's Saturday Activity.
I am sharing it below.

After that, I am sharing this week's Wednesday Lesson which you have to submit on Friday by 6 PM.

We can not allow ourselves to at a such mediocre pace.
If somehow, You have not received it, I am sharing it below again.
13/10/22, 21:41 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.
13/10/22, 21:42 - Unknown: Now, I am sharing Last week’s Saturday Activity below:

Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!
