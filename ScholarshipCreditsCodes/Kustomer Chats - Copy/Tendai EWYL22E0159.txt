04/01/23, 18:36 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

04/01/23, 23:46 - Unknown: *Wednesday Lesson | 4 Jan*

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy learning.

06/01/23, 17:09 - Tendai EWYL22E0159: Wow thank you very much yeah i leanrnt a lot about Cialdini's six principles of persuasion .

Firstly reciprocity is one of his principles where one needs to start acting and give someone a personalized and unexpected gift.So by doing that one will be creating a room for him or herself to recieve something inreturn and that is when they say \"I've scratched your back, now  you scratch mine \"...this action is very helpful in working terms 

The second principle is Scarcity where in business making products scarce leads to their demand at a high rate , so for one to be important interms of working she or he should create a sense pf scarcity around his or her own availability thus increase in desire  for what they have yo offer .

The other one is Authority where being authorised and knowledgeable results in experts who are more influential and persuasive 

Commitment and consistency is the other principle where people like to be consistent with their identity or sense of self-image .Consistency and commitment on little  and small things may result in bigger things through working with that identity in the future 

The other principle is Liking where someone to be influencial and adorable should be the one who likes first and this is usually demonstrated in advertisement where people feature with individuals designed to appeal to the product's target market .The more the consumer associates with and likes that person , the more likely they are to be influenced by them , so in other words one should pay others genuine compliments , identifying similarities and building relationships so as to become more influential 

The last principle is Consensus that is social proof .from this i have learnt that humans are social and generally feel that it's important to conform to the norms of a social group , meaning  that when it comes to decision making , we often look around us and see what others will be doing .This principle is a bit hard to use from a 
06/01/23, 17:09 - Tendai EWYL22E0159: Greetings sir
06/01/23, 17:09 - Tendai EWYL22E0159: Ok thank you

06/01/23, 18:07 - Unknown: Greetings, Tendai
I hope that you are doing well
06/01/23, 18:07 - Unknown: It is time for our session.
06/01/23, 18:08 - Unknown: Tendai, Would you be able to tell me how are you going to use these skills in the EWYL Projects?
06/01/23, 19:09 - Unknown: Edoofian, I hope that you are aware that I interact with hundreds of students in a single day.
It is my duty that each conversation that I have should be fruitful. To make sure this happens, I have allotted different time slots to each student.

But if a student is not active during this time slot, then this defeats the whole purpose.
Next time, Please make sure that you realise the importance of timeslots and free yourself up for a fruitful session because this is the only way through which we can enhance our credit earnings.

We will have an additional session at the same time Monday.
For that, Please make sure that YOU reach out to me 5 mins prior to our session timings.
Have a cheerful day ahead

Ok thank you please
09/01/23, 18:11 - Unknown: Edoofian, Due to a technical error, I was not able to share the Saturday Activity with you. Therefore, I am sharing it below:
I hope that you are aware that the deadline to share the response is 5 mins prior to our session timings
09/01/23, 18:11 - Unknown: \"Sell me this pen.\" That might just be the best sales one-liner in history.

Over the last 10 years, I've seen many sales leaders use this question as part of their interview process to whittle out the \"can-dos\" from the \"can-nots.\" 

It's a favorite amongst sales professionals, from used car salespeople to Wall Street wolves. And for good reason — it's an exciting, accessible way to test a salesperson's fundamentals. How someone responds to those four words can tell you a lot about how — and how well — a candidate is going to perform in his\/her job. 

Let's try to respond to this prominent question as part of your Saturday submission. Your response must be shared in at least 150 words. The submission deadline for the same is DATE.

I'm anticipating a highly original and creative response from your end.
09/01/23, 18:14 - Tendai EWYL22E0159: Ok , yeah m aware
09/01/23, 18:16 - Unknown: I would love to share a recent achievement of *Panashe Rueben Chimedza*, a proud Edoofian from Zimbabwe who made it to the University Basketball team of one of the prestigious institutions in India and won titles. 
The magnitude of this achievement is understood when you realize the only gold medalist for India in the previous Olympics is a student of this University thus the University gives great importance to extracurriculars.
09/01/23, 18:16 - Tendai EWYL22E0159: Ok thank you please , but can you please help me with some little explanation , i did not get the task completely
09/01/23, 18:18 - Tendai EWYL22E0159: Wow m so encouraged
09/01/23, 18:19 - Tendai EWYL22E0159: Um this is really good
09/01/23, 18:22 - Unknown: Yes, Sure
Let me help you

As your submission, You have to tell me how would you sell a pen to a person in at least 150 words.
Here you have to explain what sales tactics would you use to make the sale
09/01/23, 18:24 - Tendai EWYL22E0159: Ok thank you please , now i have an idea of what is required . So my submission is due tomorrow at 8:55 am right as 5 minutes prior our session
09/01/23, 18:28 - Unknown: Yes, Tendai.
Absolutely correct
09/01/23, 18:28 - Unknown: I would love to share a recent achievement of *Panashe Rueben Chimedza*, a proud Edoofian from Zimbabwe who made it to the University Basketball team of one of the prestigious institutions in India and won titles.

1. Community Building
2. African School Education Reform Mission Project
3. Corporate Alliance Project
09/01/23, 18:52 - Tendai EWYL22E0159: Its ok sir
09/01/23, 18:52 - Tendai EWYL22E0159: 1
09/01/23, 18:53 - Unknown: Great!
Now, I would want you to setup a target for yourself and we will together work to accomplish that.
09/01/23, 18:57 - Tendai EWYL22E0159: Yeah i chose that since m not getting access to the internet so it will be much easier reaching out to students who are showing interest through whatsApp platform
09/01/23, 18:59 - Unknown: I understand that, Tendai
So, Now, Can you tell me how many student application forms are you planning to submit?
09/01/23, 19:04 - Tendai EWYL22E0159: I should abide by the number required per day as it states that 5 completed forms per day so i will be working under   such target and also i will be seeing if i manage   to get more students who are showing interest please
09/01/23, 19:13 - Unknown: That means 50 forms?
That's a big number. Are you sure that you will be able to achieve this?
09/01/23, 19:18 - Tendai EWYL22E0159: Yeah sure it is , that is why m saying if i manage to get a large number of respondents please .Saying 5 completed forms per day , m just trying to achieve what is being required but actually it does not mean i will manage but if by chance when it happens to get more interested students surely i must abide by that
09/01/23, 19:19 - Tendai EWYL22E0159: So if it happens to have few students i will try to submit the ones i will have obtained that are completed
09/01/23, 20:00 - Unknown: Sure, Tendai.
In such case, If you are able to get more than 15 students, You can add all those students in a group and add me to that group.
Such way, I will be able to start with their counselling session fast.
09/01/23, 20:01 - Unknown: Edoofian, We will be continuing with our session Today at 3:30 PM Indian Time i.e. 12 PM Zimb Time

 Ok ,i learnt that Secret Santa is a Christmas tradition where people of specified groups get together and enjoy sharing gifts .In learning who Secret Santa is ,there is a story of a man who made the world a better place with random Acts of kindness and this was behind his true identity .The story goes on and i have understood that the man ended up visiting so many places around the globe and training others to be Secret Santas and there is no specific type of beings to be Secret Santas thus everyone can be a Secret Santa and do the same good deeds

17/12/22, 21:31 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, 
_I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?_

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!
19/12/22, 03:27 - Tendai EWYL22E0159: Santa

From Home to home, and heart to heart, from one place to another. The warmth and joy of Christmas, brings us closer to each other.

As for me i want to be my  family's ecret Santa on a such grateful day because it is said that blood is thicker than water  and my love for my family members is immesaurable .

I want to be a secret santa who's so caring and loving and to support this i am going to buy them some presents and m going to organise a family get together and i will organise a specil dinner with my family .

Further more as an appreciation of my parents' kindness and caring i am going  to buy them some gifts and that will be their clothings .On this day i want to bring some joy within my family members .

Also not forgetting my beloved friend,am going to buy a specified gift for her own choice and being her Secret Santa  i am also going to take her out for just a couple of minutes and enjoy ourselves 

These gifts i will be sharing are memorable gifts so that when i enjoy with them we will be making some memories.This will help us create a strong bond within my family and i.will.be doing this so as to express my loving and caring feelings for them .

A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle so as a Secret Santa i m going to be giving some gifts also to other misfortunes so that they also enjoy this day as well .I will be giving both tangible and monetary gifts to them to show love with my community .

Since this day will be Sunday ,there is a great chance for me as a Secret Santa to give some  of my gifts through sharing bible verses and sharing ideas about Jesus Christ our Lord and honestly that will be for one hour 

As a wish ,i wish to fulfil these on such a day so that i make memories and joy with my family members ,friend and my community

19/12/22, 20:56 - Unknown: Hello, my proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well.

I like to ponder a lot, and with it comes brainstorming, prototyping, and ideation techniques. How does the idea of meeting a CEO, knowing about their journey, and contemplating how success came to them sound? Interesting, right? Not yet?

Then perhaps you would like to know about how brands are developed, how they scale, how they flourish, and what goes into making a company from scratch to something of impeccable scale. In this webinar not only business ideations and strategies will be discussed but also brand development, moreover, our featured industry professional is profound in advertising, content marketing, and marketing research too. Who knows, something might catch your eye or let you discover your field of interest by just listening to the different structures of a company. I would genuinely implore you to give this a chance and see for yourself whether the seats we worth taking.

03/04/23, 19:01 - Unknown: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.
