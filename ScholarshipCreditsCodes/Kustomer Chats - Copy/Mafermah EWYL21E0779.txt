20/07/22, 03:06 - Mafermah EWYL21E0779: I am a proud Edoofian
20/07/22, 03:08 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

26/07/22, 17:45 - Unknown: This week, we discovered that people who are successful don't hold the world responsible for their failures. They accept accountability for their own choices and results.

29/07/22, 20:58 - Unknown: Amazing Mafemerah!
29/07/22, 20:58 - Unknown: This distinction between urgent and important is the key to prioritizing your time and your workload, whether at work, at home or when studying.
It enables you to work out what to do first, and what can be left either until later, or not done at all. For example, if you leave an urgent but unimportant task, you may find that it becomes unnecessary.
29/07/22, 21:09 - Mafermah EWYL21E0779: That's very true Mr Anshul
30/07/22, 00:15 - Unknown: So how do you believe you should put in your effort in making a schedule for your work on EWYL projects ?
30/07/22, 01:17 - Mafermah EWYL21E0779: Well I think I should have a timetable whereby I know which days of the week I have to concentrate on them since I also have to do house chores
30/07/22, 21:42 - Unknown: This will certainly help you Mafemerah.
30/07/22, 22:13 - Mafermah EWYL21E0779: Yes I will certainly do thank you Mr Anshul

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:35 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well.
