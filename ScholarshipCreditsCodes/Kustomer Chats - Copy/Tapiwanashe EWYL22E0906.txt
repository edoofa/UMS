15/02/23, 00:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Tapiwanashe!
How are you?
15/02/23, 00:25 - Tapiwanashe EWYL22E0906: I am good maam and yourself
15/02/23, 00:27 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing good, thank you.
15/02/23, 00:27 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
15/02/23, 00:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.


If you are ready then we can begin?
15/02/23, 00:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
15/02/23, 00:29 - Tapiwanashe EWYL22E0906: Okay maam
15/02/23, 01:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Tomorrow I will be sharing the Wednesday lesson with you.
Before that, can you please share with me on which project will you be working on in the month of February?
15/02/23, 02:01 - Tapiwanashe EWYL22E0906: The third project maam
15/02/23, 04:53 - Saloni Rastogi: I am happy to see your engagement, and I would want you to continue doing that, binding this family by following the daily ritual.
Also, I would like to inform you that I will not be available tomorrow since I have a medical appointment to be attended to as a priority, I hope you understand.

Some students achieved it, and some are still working.

Ready for today’s Wednesday Wisdom?

Have you ever wondered what the one governing principle that governs all businesses might be? What is the name of the one value that every company considers to be crucial? Have you ever heard of something called the North Star Metric?

North Star Metric is a key business metric that reflects the core value a product delivers to its customers. It's a single, actionable metric that aligns all efforts towards achieving long-term growth. Let us learn about in greater detail, read the lesson carefully and we will connect in our upcoming scheduled session. 

Till then Happy learning!

27/03/23, 18:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!
