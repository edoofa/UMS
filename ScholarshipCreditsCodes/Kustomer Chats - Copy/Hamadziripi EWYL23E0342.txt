11/08/23, 16:10 - Hamadziripi EWYL23E0342: Am doing well ma'am how about you
11/08/23, 16:11 - Ananya: Amazing, You know, recently we had a meeting with Angad Sir, and as a whole team, we were planning to introduce some external projects! I'm sharing this information with my students early because these external projects will be considered as valuable experience when they pursue their future dream jobs!
These projects will only be offered to students who have excelled in the EWYL journey and previous projects, as they demonstrate dedication and consistency. So, I think it's essential for us to start preparing as soon as possible. Together, we will brainstorm creative ways to maintain our positive reputation and excellent record. What are your thoughts on this?
11/08/23, 16:12 - Hamadziripi EWYL23E0342: That's wonderful ma'am
11/08/23, 16:12 - Ananya: Indeed, last year when students came to India, only well-performing students were offered some amazing projects and had the opportunity to work with renowned brands like Sirona!
Therefore, I want you to be proactive and consistent with your EWYL projects so that you can uphold your reputation in the EWYL department. This way, when an external project comes up, your name will immediately come to mind as a top candidate. Keep up the hard work, and you'll create more opportunities for yourself in the future!
11/08/23, 16:13 - Hamadziripi EWYL23E0342: Will definitely do ma'am
11/08/23, 16:17 - Ananya: So may I ask if you have any plans for grabbing this opportunity?

11/08/23, 16:36 - Hamadziripi EWYL23E0342: But am pushing the projects in the manner of that they are about to set up meetings
11/08/23, 16:38 - Ananya: I understand, however -Let me share with you how our star performer for the last week-Loice did complete her targets.
She shared three schools and you know she got to know about them through Google.
She simply searched on Google like 'School nearby'/'School in Harare'/'School in Manicaland' and so on. She was able to yield results.
So even without physically visiting them, she got to know about them through Google, got their contact details, and after that got in touch with them Via WhatsApp.
3)  please reach out to all your friends, peers, cousins, neighbors, school mates, to get their School Head's contact details.
SET 24)  visit schools in your province, physical visits can add another touch to the conversations and make them a lot more impactful.
11/08/23, 16:55 - Hamadziripi EWYL23E0342: will do the online thing ma'am
11/08/23, 17:01 - Ananya: Now, get ready because our next session is going to be super exciting!

It's crucial that we collaborate and devise a new plan of action to achieve our goals together! So, gear up and bring your creativity and enthusiasm to the table because we're going to make amazing progress! Get pumped! 🚀
11/08/23, 17:09 - Hamadziripi EWYL23E0342: Will bring the energy ma'am
