17/08/22, 17:46 - Divine EWYL22E0498: Hello it's Divine
17/08/22, 21:45 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times pere week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these att

17/08/22, 21:51 - Divine EWYL22E0498: *l am a proud edoofian*
17/08/22, 21:53 - Jasmine Kaur: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

The message that we want to be our daily habit, our words of connecting and experiencing a sense of belonging, We all at team Edoofa are very thrilled as we personally are undertaking the same activity. May I know what have you understood from this message, what is the intention behind the same?

With help of the above text, can you define who an Edoofian is?

I feel happy to motivate my students to learn new skills each week and share with me how those lessons have impacted and brought a change in them. And you know what, the way you want to earn scholarship credits and help yourself financially, I am working 10 times more than everyone so that all my students avail the best out of this opportunity. But I feel more saddened for the fact that each time I have to make you realize to follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', this is something which should be done by you without any reminders.

28/10/22, 02:00 - Jasmine Kaur: Wednesday Wisdom:
We all know that \"History is Written by Winners\", but not everybody knows the discipline, dedication, sacrifices, time, and efforts put behind it.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the kind of mindset a winner possesses, and about the person who carved his way from the bottom to the top, and even beyond. The story of a basketball player turning into a lethal black mamba on the court, the habits he formed, and the mindset he forged, to turn into a winner, is inspirational and the most practical way to better oneself every single day. You will learn a lot of different things from this lesson, about the attitude, instinct, and character of a true all-round winner.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

I hope that you are familiar with the Indian education system.The modern curriculum comprises a holistic learning approach and doesn't just limit itself to core subjects. Universities now tend to focus more on acquiring skills in technology, communication, critical thinking and problem solving. 

There is also enough emphasis on cultural studies and society. These aspects help you understand the problems that many communities face and they get an idea as to how they can use their knowledge for the betterment of the same.
There is also an equal emphasis on extracurricular activities to help build your personality and improve your innate strengths
Now, I have a small task for you all. I want you all to write a review about what your reviews are regarding edoofa and Indian education. Make sure you make me proud and share a screenshot here today itself. I have attached a review manual manual which explains how to write a *GOOGLE REVIEW and FACEBOOK REVIEW*.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.
 
I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.
 
Happy Learning.

Hope you had a great weekend,


*The below given is your weekend activity, it is a very interesting personality test,I would like you all to take this test so that you can understand your true personality!

*Tell me your reviews after this, I am waiting as we will be completing this in this session!*

\"Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.\" ~ Bruce Lee

In this week's Wednesday lesson, you learned about the different sorts of personalities a person carries, but only a true leader is one who understands their personality and can do wonders with its power. In today's activity, I want you to dig deeper into your own consciousness and learn more about the kind of personality you are. As I believe, the more you know yourself, the clearer your vision of the world and your mind gets. Below is a link to a personality test, which you shall be taking up this week, and then would be sharing the results via a screenshot to your mentors by Monday. You can then read and understand more about your results by discussing them with your Mentor.

Link to the Test: :


https:\/\/my-personality-test.com\/true-colours


This particular exercise is going to give you an insight into the kind of person you are so that you can use your strengths to yield the maximum benefits in whatever work you take up.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own personality while performing this activity.
