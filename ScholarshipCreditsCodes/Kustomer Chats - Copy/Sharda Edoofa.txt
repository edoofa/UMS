15/06/23, 12:26 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week’s Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better—together. It’s why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger—as successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!

28/06/23, 11:30 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!
