Welcome to our follow-up session. I hope you've had a productive week! Today, we'll dive into the objectives and progress of our Community Building Project. I want to make sure you understand the goals clearly, discuss your achievements, and set new targets. Let's get started!

I am genuinely happy with how good you have started and always know that this is just the beginning and you have a really long way to go.
The only key to success is consistency.
22/09/23, 16:52 - VIMBAI EWYL23E0413: Yes ma'am
22/09/23, 16:52 - Unknown: Before we move ahead please provide me your understanding of the wednesday lesson.
22/09/23, 16:54 - VIMBAI EWYL23E0413: The Wednesday lesson was bases upon freelancing.
22/09/23, 16:57 - Unknown: Yes
22/09/23, 16:58 - Unknown: Now that you have got the forms
22/09/23, 16:58 - Unknown: Please  make sure the students are completely aware of what Edoofa is and what it does and even the admission stages.

If the student goes to the admission counselor and denies that his/her friend did not discuss anything about Edoofa then you will not earn any scholarship credits.
22/09/23, 16:58 - Unknown: Are you following Vimbai?
22/09/23, 16:59 - Unknown: Because these instructions are very very important
22/09/23, 17:02 - Unknown: Along with that make sure you are giving them an explanation about your journey, about the benefits that you have got and about the skills that you will be acquiring in the process.
22/09/23, 17:05 - VIMBAI EWYL23E0413: Noted ma'am . I discussed with them and explained the scholarship program as well .
22/09/23, 17:05 - VIMBAI EWYL23E0413: Noted ma'am
22/09/23, 17:18 - Unknown: Make it clear to students that Edoofa is not a sponsorship platform. Rather, you will get a scholarship on the basis of various factors which include your grades in previous classes, the way you perform in your interviews, your statement of purpose, your letter of recommendation and many more.Along with it Make it clear to students that Edoofa is not a sponsorship platform.

22/09/23, 17:18 - Unknown: Also, you can compare the cost of studying in your own country with the cost of studying in India through Edoofa. And guess what? It's usually cheaper to study in India with Edoofa!
22/09/23, 17:28 - Unknown: Now, I'd like to hear about your progress. How many students have you successfully contacted so far?

Are you ready for the session now?
26/09/23, 16:12 - Unknown: First, let's revisit the objective. In the Community Building Project, our aim is to contact 40 other students and collect at least 20 filled forms. This project is about fostering a sense of community and involvement among our peers and most importantly learning the skills to speak with confidence and conviction infront of people.
27/09/23, 13:10 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. I am excited to inform you that today's lesson will revolve around a crucial skill that can greatly impact your academic success: "Mastering Time Management During Exam Season."
As we all know, effective time management is essential for achieving your academic goals, especially when the pressure mounts during exam periods. In today's lesson, we will delve into the importance of time management, explore strategies to make the most of your study time, and discuss techniques to strike a balance between your coursework/EWYL commitments and exam preparation.

Together, we will equip ourselves with valuable skills to navigate the demands of exam season successfully.
Best wishes
Team EWYL

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning
