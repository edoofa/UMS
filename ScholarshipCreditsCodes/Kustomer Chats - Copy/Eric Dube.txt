19/07/22, 22:55 - Eric Dube: THE FASTEST GROWING BUSINESS IN ZIMBABWE.

One of the fastest growing business fields in Zimbabwe is Business Consultancy.

 *BUSINESS* *CONSULTANCY*
 Although it might not seem to be a straightfoward or rather more direct business to pursue, business consultancy in a different angle is a lucrative business to put your money into.Why here in Zimbabwe? One thing  is certain Zimbabweans are turning to business as a way to grapple with economic conditions and high unemployment rates. Zimbabweans are starting small, micro business in all directions inorder to cope with the brutal economic crisis. Some of these businesses have a real chance to grow and that is where the business expertise of business consultants gets in. Guiding these businesses from the current position to the next step is a lucrative market.The big question is how do you then guide and help these businesses to grow and what are some of these small specific businesses. The IT sector in Zimbabwe is not at its highest level but it is significantly growing. Some lucrative opportunities are computer assembling and computer training institutes.  Identifying ideas that could boost growth and efficiency  might be profitable. Implementing those ideas might change the complexion of these businesses. This should be a business who is willing to assist these businesses in any way possible. The business consultant should provide any necessary training and resources to staff and management.

 *SWOT* *ANALYSIS*

1) Hardworking staff and brave board members. 
2) Good interpersonal skills
3) Financially stable, with good funding agencies and other sources of income. 
4) Quality delivery
