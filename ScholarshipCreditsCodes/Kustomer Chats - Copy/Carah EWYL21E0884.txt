15/07/22, 17:16 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
15/07/22, 18:04 - Unknown: Good Morning, Proud Edoofian

The deadline to make the submission is *Thursday* *6 PM*. Please make sure that you submit your response before that because the *Academic Board* keeps a very strict check on these things. 
 
The aim of this activity is to make you aware of the life journey of Patrice Motsepe and how you can inculcate his traits in your daily life.
15/07/22, 18:04 - Unknown: After you have gone through the above messave regarding the Wednesday Lesson, Let us start with our previous discussion on the Proud Edoofian ritual
16/07/22, 04:15 - Carah EWYL21E0884: Very sorry for late submission 
The assignment is on its way
16/07/22, 17:56 - Unknown: Good Morning, Proud Edoofian ?
I hope that you are in good health and spirits

We will be continuing with where we left in our scheduled session next week.

20/07/22, 08:30 - Carah EWYL21E0884: Fast growing industries or sectors in Zimbabwe include mining gold , microfinance accounting and bookkeeping and car importation\/ sales however this submissions choice of industry is the car importation industry. 

Car importation \/sale's growth can be observed by the statistics  from Zimbabwe Revenue Authority  that vehicle imports grew from 50 781 to 55 550 between 2019 and 2020. This sudden increase was due to corona virus were gatherings and public vehicles were restricted thus individuals would opt for a personal vehicle hence increased opportunity for sales .
 This sector does not only benefit the importation sector but the government of Zimbabwe as well thought tax payments and tollgate fees .
 
Nevertheless the government came to a decision to restrict the importation of vehicles that are more than 10 years old so as a strategy to revive the countries public transport system , Zimbabwe United Passenger Company (Zupco) for economic growth . This was a threat to the car importation industry. 

In short there is an increased demand for  imported cars in  Zimbabwe as the general notion is that these cars are cheaper than those produced by the local manufacturers. Ready market is available.Growth is restricted by government important bans on second hand vehicles though that is also viewed as a way to protect the local manufacturing industry as an increase in car importation corresponded to a decrease in sales from local manufacturing industries.

I hope that you are doing well

As August Intake is right at our doorsteps, So due to this many of our Edoofians will be arriving here in India to kick start their dream journey.?

I feel that it is my duty to make sure that the university has prepared well for their onboarding process.

This is why I would be visiting the universities Today in order to do a personal check up.
Since, This process would take up lots of time that is why we won't be able to connect Today.
However, I am sure that in my absence, You will make sure that you follow the below given things:

1. Make sure to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual at 9 AM Tomorrow.
2. Do submit the Wednesday Lesson before the deadline.
22/07/22, 23:33 - Carah EWYL21E0884: Alright Sir
22/07/22, 23:43 - Carah EWYL21E0884: Wednesday Lesson :

The lesson is on mastering the right attitude . 
It goes on and talk about rising up and put in the work if you are to accomplish a goal . It takes time to master that goal but if you don't put I the work and things don't go as planned , one is not supposed to blame the circumstances but his\/ her negligence .
23/07/22, 19:29 - Unknown: Good Morning, Proud Edoofian ?
I hope that you are doing well
23/07/22, 19:29 - Unknown: I am very glad to see your submission.
If you have to point out one major learning from this lesson.
May I know what it would be?
23/07/22, 19:30 - Carah EWYL21E0884: Good morning 
I am doing well , how about you?
23/07/22, 19:35 - Carah EWYL21E0884: Not being reluctant die to certain circumstances
25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!
