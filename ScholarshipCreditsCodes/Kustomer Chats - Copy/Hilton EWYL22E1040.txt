Share in the comments if you have known this before and why is it important!!
10/06/23, 12:54 - Hilton EWYL22E1040: Accessible 
Employable 
Affordable 
These are important because the EWYL program helps students become financially independent, helping them get skills that they are able to use in the field of their work
10/06/23, 16:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week’s Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better—together. It’s why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger—as successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!

10/06/23, 16:13 - Hilton EWYL22E1040: Okay
10/06/23, 16:43 - Hilton EWYL22E1040: In order to deepen my relationship with the Edoofa Program and develop a stronger network for myself, I would take the following steps:

1. Engage with other students: I would actively participate in online forums, social media groups, and webinars organized by the Edoofa community. By engaging in meaningful discussions, sharing experiences, and providing support to fellow students, I can build a strong network of like-minded individuals.

2. Motivate friends: I would share my positive experiences with the Edoofa Program with my friends and acquaintances, encouraging them to consider joining the program themselves. By sharing the advantages and opportunities this program has provided me, I can inspire others to pursue a path towards success.

3. Organize events: To build a stronger Edoofa student community, I would take the initiative to organize events that can bring students together. These events might include online workshops, group study sessions, and social gatherings. By creating opportunities for students to interact and learn from one another, we can foster a sense of unity and camaraderie.

4. Mentorship: As I gain experience and knowledge through the Edoofa Program, I would consider becoming a mentor to new students. By offering guidance and support to those who are just starting their journey, I can contribute to the growth of the community and strengthen my own connections.

5. Collaborate on projects: I would seek out opportunities to work with other Edoofa students on projects and assignments. By collaborating with others, we can expand our knowledge, develop new skills, and build lasting professional relationships.

6. Continuously improve: I would strive to always improve and grow, both personally and academically, by taking advantage of the resources and opportunities provided by the Edoofa Program. By demonstrating my commitment to excellence, I can inspire others and set a positive example for the community.

7. Stay connected: Even after completing the Edoofa Program, I would maintain my connections with fellow students and the larger community. By staying involved and staying in touch, I can continue to contribute to the growth of the Edoofa student community and maintain a strong network for myself.

By following these steps, I would work towards deepening my relationship with the Edoofa Program, building a better and stronger student community, and ultimately developing a stronger network for myself.

There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

The feedback we have received from some of you on this week’s Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.
As part of this week’s Saturday Activity, you are required to share your written submission on : 
What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?
There is no word limit, so feel free to express your understanding in detail. The second answer requires some mental work, so sit with yourself, introspect, and share your honest answer with your mentor. 
Let this activity play an important role in your personal goal setting. We will connect soon in our upcoming session. 
Till then, happy learning and happy growing!","transform":"

20/03/23, 17:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my proud Edoofian!

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!","transform":"
