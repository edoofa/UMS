08/07/23, 13:37 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

Its time for our Saturday Activity, I want you to delve into the realm of inspiration and write a detailed essay about a person whom you know personally and who embodies the remarkable trait of consistency. This individual has consistently demonstrated their dedication, determination, and unwavering commitment, becoming a true source of inspiration for you.

In your essay, please explore the key aspects of their life, experiences, and actions that exemplify their consistent nature. Describe how their consistent approach has positively influenced and impacted not only their own life but also the lives of those around them. Reflect on specific instances or situations where their consistent behavior or mindset has motivated you to strive for excellence or overcome challenges in your own life.

Feel free to include personal anecdotes, observations, or conversations that highlight the impact this person's consistency has had on your growth and development. Additionally, analyze the qualities, values, or strategies that you believe contribute to their ability to maintain consistency over time.
I am excited to read your insightful essays and learn about the inspiring individuals who have demonstrated the power of consistency.
Best regards,
Team EWYL

14/08/23, 16:52 - Ananya: You know, recently we had a meeting with Angad Sir, and as a whole team, we were planning to introduce some external projects! I'm sharing this information with my students early because these external projects will be considered as valuable experience when they pursue their future dream jobs!
These projects will only be offered to students who have excelled in the EWYL journey and previous projects, as they demonstrate dedication and consistency. So, I think it's essential for us to start preparing as soon as possible. Together, we will brainstorm creative ways to maintain our positive reputation and excellent record. What are your thoughts on this?
14/08/23, 17:01 - Kundai EWYL23E0148: That is great news Ms.Ananya and l also aware of the fact that l have not been consistent with my projects  and l have also not done most of them l will try my best to focus mainly on them once l am done writing in  November.Thank you also for your patience and understanding thus far.

Therefore, I want you to be proactive and consistent with your EWYL projects so that you can uphold your reputation in the EWYL department. This way, when an external project comes up, your name will immediately come to mind as a top candidate. Keep up the hard work, and you'll create more opportunities for yourself in the future!
