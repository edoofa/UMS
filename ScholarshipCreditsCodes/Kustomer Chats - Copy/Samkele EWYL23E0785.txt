The Great Rift Valley is like Mother Nature showing off her impressive artistic skills. Just breathtaking!

Wishing you a day filled with enthusiasm, productivity, and all-around happiness.
Are you ready for the sessionðŸš€
20/11/23, 14:32 - Aditi Kapoor: Samkele, I'm deeply disappointed that you missed our scheduled session today
20/11/23, 14:42 - Samkele EWYL23E0785: I didn't miss the session I did the routine and you ignored it earlier
20/11/23, 14:48 - Aditi Kapoor: With the platform shift, I anticipated your presence during the scheduled session time from 9:30 to 11 am. Due to the adjustment in the EWYL line, it took me a bit more time to locate your name, and for that delay, I apologize. However, you didn't join within the specified timeframe, so I shared my disappointment.
20/11/23, 14:54 - Samkele EWYL23E0785: OK ma'am understood it won't happen again
20/11/23, 15:31 - Aditi Kapoor: It's okay!
