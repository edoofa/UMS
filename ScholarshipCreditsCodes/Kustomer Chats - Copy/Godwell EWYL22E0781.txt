15/12/22, 02:22 - Godwell EWYL22E0781: Good evening
In today’s topic on Secret Santa, I learnt a lot about kindness. Secret Santa is a tradition where people show kindness in giving and also giving a word of uplifting to others in need of it. When someone gives you a hand in something it might be a gift box or money when you are in need, you must return the favor someday to someone else.

In this webinar not only business ideations and strategies will be discussed but also brand development, moreover, our featured industry professional is profound in advertising, content marketing, and marketing research too. Who knows, something might catch your eye or let you discover your field of interest by just listening to the different structures of a company. I would genuinely implore you to give this a chance and see for yourself whether the seats we worth taking.

17/12/22, 20:14 - Ananya: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!\\

27/01/23, 00:34 - Ananya: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

01/02/23, 21:18 - Ananya: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

Happy Learning!

Linked in has made it easier for companies to employ skilled and experienced people into there companies. This has also  encouraged us as students to be innovative so that we become unique, increasing our chances of working for big companies in the future. Seeing people post about there achievements encourages others of atmechieving there goals and also networking with those people for self improvements.

Its time for your Saturday Activity, This activity will allows you to reflect on your leadership abilities, share your experiences with your mentor, and receive feedback from them, which can help you grow as a leader.

1. You are required to think about a situation where you had to take the lead, such as organizing a school event, starting a new club, or resolving a conflict among friends.
2. Write a short reflection on the experience, focusing on the following points:
* What was the situation and what were the challenges you faced?
* How did you demonstrate the inner sense of captaincy in this situation?
* What were the results of your actions and how did you feel about your leadership?

You are required to share your responses by DATE over the EYWL Line.

11/02/23, 19:33 - Ananya: Yes so were you ever a leader before? Like a prefect or captain?
11/02/23, 22:44 - Godwell EWYL22E0781: I was a prefect at my former school
12/02/23, 03:40 - Godwell EWYL22E0781: At my previous school I was a junior prefect. Our main duties were to monitor the hostels, making sure they were clean all the time and also being able to asssociate well with everyone. 

We had our thorough cleaning every Saturday. On a Saturday in July, we had a through but I noticed something in one of the students belongings. It was a book from the library. Usually books were booked overnight and returned the following day before 8am. What surprised me was that it was already 10am and the student still had a library book. I asked him about the book but he just remained quiet. Then I checked the book, the book was never booked and it was stolen. 

I took him to the room where I slept, I asked him politely to return the book but he denied. I  waited thinking he would return it, but it was a waste of time. I later on reported the issue to the librarian who made him return the book.

I learnt  that the right thing must be done regardless of the response from anyone.

The feedback we have received from some of you on this week’s Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.
As part of this week’s Saturday Activity, you are required to share your written submission on : 
What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?
There is no word limit, so feel free to express your understanding in detail. The second answer requires some mental work, so sit with yourself, introspect, and share your honest answer with your mentor. 
Let this activity play an important role in your personal goal setting. We will connect soon in our upcoming session.
