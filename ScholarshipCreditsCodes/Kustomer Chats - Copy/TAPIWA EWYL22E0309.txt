2 https:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-is-needed-to-become-a-game-developer
13/07/22, 03:38 - TAPIWA EWYL22E0309: Becoming a game developer is just as hard as getting into any other career, but with added competition and the need to be constantly fresh and relevant. However, by applying yourself and keeping your long-term goals in mind, it can be a rewarding and fulfilling career as easy to progress through as anything. Most game software developers have a formal education background, with at least a bachelor's degree. Employers tend to prefer candidates who have completed four-year degree courses as they have a more in-depth scientific grounding that is necessary for game development. However, there is a way one can get the skill nurtured since childhood for example, one of my nephew joined an online learning course \"Skooqs\" 2 years ago. The course enables kids to develop their technology skills, game development inclusive so therefore when the skill is develop since childhood then it will become a very simple task in the long run.
13/07/22, 21:05 - Unknown: Hello Tapiwa, how are you doing?
13/07/22, 21:12 - Unknown: Good work on the task Tapiwa. Please note that you have to share the post on your instagram and facebook story.

Game Development
How to Become a Game Developer
As the internet and web applications become a bigger part of our lives, the gaming industry's growth has exploded, and with it, the demand for Game Developers. Gaming companies are releasing products on our phones and computers, where we are spending more and more time.
Someone has to build, update, and maintain the games people play every day. Worldwide, Game Developers are in high demand, commanding impressive salaries. Game development is an attractive career path for many, especially for those that enjoy gaming.
So, how do you become a Game Developer? In this guide, we give you all the information you need to decide if a career in game development is right for you. We also provide details on Game Developers' salaries and training programs.
What is a Game Developer?
Game Developers are responsible for designing, programming and testing games. Their work involves creating the visual content of a game as well as writing the code necessary to implement its features.
Game Developers create specifications for a game, and use those specifications to inform the plan. They create the storyline, characters, activities, scoring system, and environment of the game, breaking each component into smaller parts assigned to different team members.
These professionals use programming languages to write the code that supplies the logic and allows the player to interact with the game. But the work of a Game Developer does not stop there—throughout the development process, they must also test the game and debug code to ensure users have a seamless experience.
Game Developers continue to make improvements to the game after its release. Such enhancements include add-ons to the game that introduce new levels and functionality.
This is a list of the main responsibil
14/07/22, 04:23 - TAPIWA EWYL22E0309: You typically require a bachelor's level qualification in computer science or software engineering to pursue a career in gaming. Pursuing a college degree will provide you with a well-rounded education in computer science, opening the doors to a career in game development.
Coding bootcamps are an excellent alternative to a college education. A coding bootcamp allows you to acquire the skills you need to thrive in a specific career in technology in a fraction of the time you would need for a university degree. Also, during your time at a bootcamp, you will build your professional portfolio to show potential employers. A relative example is one of my nephews who has always wanted to attend a bootcamp named Skooqs in Nigeria since 2019 but couldn't go there due to distance. But however, since Covid-19 started, Skooqs began teaching online programming courses and my nephew has been attending them since then. Talking of now, my nephew is a very great game programmer due to the skills he gained from the online course so to a certain extent, the use of online courses such as Skooqs really help in producing very great game developers.

14/07/22, 20:54 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

16/07/22, 20:50 - Unknown: Yes that is alright, however, if you read the link carefully, then you will be able to see the question and write the answer here in the chat with me.
16/07/22, 20:50 - Unknown: Right?
16/07/22, 20:50 - Unknown: Do mention about Skooqs in the answers.
16/07/22, 21:06 - TAPIWA EWYL22E0309: 1. Strong IT skills are needed for one to become a game developer. There is need for skills such as critical thinking, effective communication, creativity and programming knowledge. Beyond coding, you need to have a flair of design. As graphics and animation play a huge role in video games, game designers need to be familiar with character design, scenery design and used interface design. So for one to develop all these skills, there are various courses and even online they may partake for example the Skooqs program which teaches programming from the youngest age. With the use of such online programmes, one can get the best game development skills ever.
16/07/22, 21:17 - TAPIWA EWYL22E0309: 2. There are a lot various websites which offer online teaching activities for kids. Basing on my experience, one of my nephews joined the Skooqs online course for programming just two years ago and speaking of now, he is a very great programmer. Only 6 months after he has started the course, he started creating very great video games so I highly recommend the Skooqs course for all kids who would like to engage in programming.

18/07/22, 20:46 - TAPIWA EWYL22E0309: So for the Saturday activity:
The fast growing business in my country is in the agriculture sector. Lately tobacco has become one of the major exports in Zimbabwe. Currently tobacco is contributing more than 10% to the country's GDP. Growth of tobacco has also contributed largely to the country's foreign currency earnings. Some problems though are being faced by the industry. There has been some pests which have been affecting the growth of tobacco though the farmers have been managing to control the infections. Another rising problem is that the economy has been rapidly growing unstable so this has affected the farmers due to losses caused by devaluation in our local currency. Our farmers have managed to target the international market and better sales have been made since then. There are some threats though to the industry such as burning of the leaves due to sudden fire outbreaks. This is being managed by use of fire breaks and also insuring the fields so as to avoid the losses.
18/07/22, 20:48 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation.

19/07/22, 00:02 - TAPIWA EWYL22E0309: 3. Scratch is a great tool for developing the programming skills of learners, since it allows all manner of different programs to be built. The most important thing in any Scratch program are the sprites. Sprites are the graphical objects or characters that perform a function in your program. The default sprite in Scratch is the cat, which can easily be changed. The stage is basically the background of your project. Like sprites, the stage can have different costumes that change as the story plays out. The stage window is the main area where the action of your program takes place. The set of instructions that is used to program in Scratch is called a script. It is a stack or collection of blocks that connect with one another. There are also various other practices in scratch programming so for one to become a successful scratch programmer, there can be use of various online programming courses. Well to be specific, one of my nephews has been attending Skooqs online programming course since he was 5years old. One thing I like about the Skooqs program is that they can teach kids to become the best programmers and I therefore recommend Skooqs for all kids who would like to become successful programmers.
19/07/22, 00:06 - Unknown: Good Tapiwa! keep it up.

19/07/22, 01:30 - TAPIWA EWYL22E0309: 4. Kids may use the internet during their spare time. The internet also provides kids with information they may basically need even in their education. There are various websites that can entertain kids such as free and fun, PBS kids, Sesame Street and many more. There are also other various websites that may help kids develop helpful skills that may also help them in life such as the *Skooqs* page. Skooqs gives various computing courses online, which gives kids the best programming and coding experiences ever. With such helpful sites, our kids will grow up being smart.

Hello all, I am _______ father\/mother of _________. I am here to talk about Skooqs, I have enrolled my boy for the online course. He showed great passion for computers and I thought why not start early. At least he will be engaged and learn something new. Little did I know, it will have such a great impact on his academics, my boy’s academic performance, and his maths and logic grades have skyrocketed, and he is now more creative in thinking and always ready to answer questions in class like his teachers told me. Also, he has gotten better with his game development skills. He showed me the game he has built all by himself and I was so proud of him. I am sure he has a long way to go and certainly, the boy has a bright future. I would like to express my gratitude to Skooqs for giving him the right direction.
