Our focus will be on a book titled "The Start-Up of You," a thought-provoking read that offers valuable insights and learnings applicable to our personal and professional lives.

To make the most of today's session, I encourage each and every one of you to diligently read the accompanying PDF. Take your time to absorb the concepts, anecdotes, and strategies shared within its pages. The Start-Up of You presents a compelling perspective on how to navigate the ever-changing landscape of the modern world, emphasizing the importance of adaptability, resilience, and seizing opportunities.

Remember, the lessons we learn together shape our growth and shape us as individuals. As proud Edoofians, we strive for continuous improvement and seek knowledge from every available resource.

We should apply the skills that we learn in our day to day lives so as to become professional entrepreneurs one day.

09/06/23, 18:31 - Saloni Rastogi: Hi Grace
09/06/23, 18:31 - Grace EWYL23E0201: How are you?
10/06/23, 13:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week‚Äôs Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better‚Äîtogether. It‚Äôs why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger‚Äîas successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!
10/06/23, 16:15 - Grace EWYL23E0201: It takes a community to be able to render a project or task successful in the end. I only truly believed this after joining the Edoofa team and becoming part of a family whose aim is to support and build one another. Because I've experienced the positive impacts of becoming a proud Edoofian, I saw it fit to let my peers know about this once in a lifetime chance to become better and greater people in the future. Helping each other with knowledge and research will help to gather together important information that will be useful in our future careers and so as to share with other people as well who might not be able to get such an opprtunity. I've managed to get some friends to see how wonderful this program and they have taken action to also becoming part of the family. It is very essential for one to never forget where they came from and what made them into the success that they are. That is why I am in the processing of fully engaging my school and letting them know about this profound program so that my juniors will have more light on how their futures will be so bright after enrolling with Edoofa. This will help me to become more patient and persuasive hence improving my marketing and networking skills.

21/06/23, 17:11 - Grace EWYL23E0201: Our circumstances should not determine what our future will be like. Instead, they should serve as a source of motivation and direction for where we want to be in the future. We should aim to be the strength of those around us and our fellow Edoofians when they are faced with hard times. It is also important for us as Edoofians and leaders of tomorrow to be able to be truthful at all times as it makes life easier for everyone. Just as Ellen Sirleaf managed to rise above the issues to do with gender inequality, we should also strive to do the same and lift each other up. Youth empowerment through education is very vital and we should take the Edoofa program seriously as it will be transformative for our lives. United we stand and as Edoofians we should be willing to work together as one so as to succeed.
21/06/23, 17:33 - Grace EWYL23E0201: My entrepreneur of choice is Ruvheneko Parirenyatwa. She was born into a family that had what it took to live life to the fullest being able to afford a good lifestyle which is something kind of different from my life story. Regardless of being the daughter of a renowned physician and politician, she still had the zeal to make a life of her own and to live not according to what people thought she would do but according to what she wanted for herself which was so inspiring. From being a broadcastor on the country's tv and radio stations, she has also become one of the things I aspire to be which is a philanthropist. The youth are indeed the leaders of tomorrow and the guidance that she gives to them is amazing and something that is in my pipeline for the future. She didn't take comfort in the priviledges that she grew up with but managed to see beyond that and still wanted something to her name which i really admire about her. Ruvheneko has a taste for politics and wanting to know everything from the horse's mouth which is one dissimilarity between us but this symbolises so much boldness and courage indeed!

We hope this message finds you well in your academic pursuits. We are excited to share a Saturday activity centered around learning from influential personalities. Our chosen figure is Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of Liberia and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Through her remarkable leadership and unwavering determination, she has left an indelible mark on history. Let's draw valuable lessons from her life for our personal development.

Two traits that stand out about Ellen Johnson Sirleaf are resilience and visionary leadership. These qualities can greatly contribute to our growth and development as individuals. They can positively impact our academic pursuits, relationships, and future career goals.

To develop resilience, we can learn from Sirleaf's ability to bounce back from challenges. We can seek out difficult experiences and learn from them, cultivating a mindset of perseverance and adaptability.

Here are some suggestions to help you get started:

Identify two traits: Reflect on Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's qualities that resonate with you.

Reflect on personal development: Consider how these traits can positively impact your academic pursuits, relationships, or future career goals.

Create an action plan: Outline practical steps like seeking mentorship, practicing self-discipline, engaging in community service, or pursuing relevant courses and extracurricular activities.
Let's embark on this exciting journey together and make Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's legacy an integral part of our own lives.
Best regards,

Team Edoofa

24/06/23, 19:53 - Grace EWYL23E0201: Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was a force to reckon with as she was driven by integrity which is something so admirable about her. It is so rare to find someone who is upfront about being against corruption and who actually works towards it. Before even getting to the higher levels of corruption, integrity is about treating those who are around you including your fellow edoofians in the same way despite  who they are, what they have or do not have. This really is a lesson for me to be fair towards everyone because this can form trust which can help assisting each other school wise as well as becoming trustworthy employees to our future employers. Secondly, she managed to break gender barriers which was much needed in a world where men were deemed to be deserving of certain opportunities like leading a country. This has helped me to believe in myself as the girl child and to affirm myself that I'm capable of doing anything that I can put my mind to. Ellen has served as motivation to target those large companies and be the one with the highest position because why not? For this to become true for me as well, I will have to read widely on other females who have made it to the top and learn from them. I would need to be consistent in cultivating those habits until they become a lifestyle which means success will be just a step away!
