12/07/22, 21:31 - Unknown: Also I am very happy to see your understanding of being a proud edoofian Ruwende, really amazing the way you grow in your each session.
12/07/22, 21:38 - Ruwende EWYL21E0526: ?yeah l am trying
12/07/22, 22:47 - Ruwende EWYL21E0526: I have managed to go through the audio but the pdf only consist of 2 blank pages
13/07/22, 22:42 - Unknown: Hello Ruwende!
How's your day going?
13/07/22, 22:43 - Unknown: Ruwende let me resend you the Wednesday lesson once again.
13/07/22, 22:43 - Unknown: Here we have another dose of Wednesday wisdom on our most loved topic of Entrepreneurship. Yes, today’s lesson is going to talk about a sincere and passionate young female entrepreneur who has made her mark on the African Start up ecosystem. She is an award-winning UI\/UX Designer with seven years of experience working in the technology environment. We are talking about Oluwadamilola Soyombo, the founder of Skooqs. Today’s lesson will take us through the incident when Skooqs was born. I am sure a very valuable lesson is there for all of us to learn from. \u2028\u2028Also, I would like to highlight that Skooqs has partnered with Edoofa and will be working closely on providing our students with projects to work on and gain experience.  The first batch is already assigned the project. \u2028\u2028Go through the audio and pdf carefully and let me know if you have any concerns.
13/07/22, 22:45 - Unknown: Please let me know once it is done.
14/07/22, 04:10 - Ruwende EWYL21E0526: It's the same pdf  it's blank
14/07/22, 22:44 - Unknown: Hello Ruwende!
How's your day going?
14/07/22, 22:58 - Unknown: I hope it is okay now. If not, then please let me know.
15/07/22, 00:32 - Ruwende EWYL21E0526: Thanks l have managed to go through it
15/07/22, 03:23 - Unknown: Then please share your response.
15/07/22, 19:05 - Ruwende EWYL21E0526: One learning l have learnt from the inspiring story  is that one can move from just being an idea , to having product live,  with courses , instructors and schools . I have also leant that for one to be successful there is need for advisers , friends  (team work ) and also prayers
15/07/22, 23:09 - Ruwende EWYL21E0526: I am proud edoofian✨
15/07/22, 23:11 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

22/07/22, 00:09 - Ruwende EWYL21E0526: In our Wednesday lesson l have learnt that we shouldn't  blame our resources or people around us when we fail to achieve what we want inlife . I have  also learnt that things don't happen magically when one wants to be successful  he or she has to work extra hard
22/07/22, 04:29 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Ruwende!
How's your day going?
22/07/22, 04:30 - Ruwende EWYL21E0526: Going very well thanks
22/07/22, 04:30 - Unknown: I read your response Ruwende and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
22/07/22, 04:31 - Unknown: So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom (already discussed)
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects (still left)
3. your pending response to the weekend activity (still left)
22/07/22, 04:47 - Ruwende EWYL21E0526: Ooh okay
22/07/22, 17:17 - Unknown: Good morning Ruwende!
How did your day go?
22/07/22, 17:18 - Unknown: Since you have typed 2 and you are willing to know what a proud edoofian is and what it denotes, I would love to enlighten you with knowledge on the same.
22/07/22, 17:19 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
22/07/22, 17:19 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
22/07/22, 17:21 - Unknown: Let me know if you now you are aware of who a proud edoofian is and what is the importance of following this ritual daily.
22/07/22, 17:22 - Unknown: As we move on after you acknowledge, we will be left with our discussion on:
1. Progress on our three ongoing projects (still left)
2. your pending response to the weekend activity (still left)
25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:34 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well.

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
