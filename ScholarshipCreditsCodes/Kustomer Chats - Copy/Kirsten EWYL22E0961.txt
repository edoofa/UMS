24/01/23, 22:41 - Aditi Kapoor: Sat activity: 

Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

A college student named Rachel was unsure of what career path to pursue after graduation. She talked to several professionals in different fields, but none of them seemed to fit her interests and skills. One day, she had a conversation with a mentor who asked her the right questions, such as \"What are you passionate about?\" and \"What do you enjoy doing in your free time?\" Rachel realized that her true passion was writing and storytelling. She decided to pursue a career in journalism and landed a job at a top news outlet.

We gained knowledge on how to ask intelligent questions. I'd like you to share with us any two questions you'd like to ask yourself as part of your Saturday submission. The questions that you may have been hesitant to make, the questions that put you in a difficult situation, the inquiries that will have a significant impact on your career and future. For example:  1. What is the limit of my current capabilities and how can I push beyond them to continue learning and growing?\"
2. “How can I ensure that my actions align with my values and contribute to the greater good, rather than just maximizing my own success?\"

Looking forward to your response!
24/01/23, 22:41 - Kirsten EWYL22E0961: Alright sir thank you
24/01/23, 22:43 - Kirsten EWYL22E0961: Oh,okay sir thank you?
25/01/23, 22:47 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

As you begin to think about your professional future, I want to remind you of the importance of creating and maintaining a strong presence on LinkedIn. Today’s Wednesday wisdom is talking in detail about the importance of LinkedIn in a student’s life and also how you can create an amazing LinkedIn profile for yourself. So what are you waiting for, go ahead, listen to the audio and read the PDF carefully! I will connect with you in our upcoming session and have a detailed discussion with you concerning your learnings!

All the best!
26/01/23, 07:25 - Kirsten EWYL22E0961: 1.What does the future hold? 
2.What if l fail in life?, what if l fail to make my parents proud ?, what will happen to them?, what will happen to me as well?, my life and everything?. What about my young brothers?,will dad be able to send them to school on his own if l don't make it? How will l face him if anything goes wrong?.Will l ever be able to take care of my parents, relatives, friends and family  as much as they take care of me?

 What will happen to me?
26/01/23, 07:26 - Kirsten EWYL22E0961: What if my dream doesn't come true?, what will happen to me?
26/01/23, 07:39 - Kirsten EWYL22E0961: Sir those are some of the questions that make me feel so nervous to even think about.
