12/07/22, 23:06 - Unknown: Good afternoon Pardon
19/07/22, 20:55 - Pardon EWYL22E0112: Iam a proud Edoofian
19/07/22, 20:57 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

20/07/22, 20:30 - Unknown: Who informed you about this?
21/07/22, 16:21 - Unknown: Hello my proud hope you are doing well,. We are back with another Wednesday wisdom. I am sure you will agree to the fact that Attitude plays a major role in our day-to-day life. It is also a waste of time if the proper attitude and effective abilities are not developed. In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we discuss a crucial character quality that everyone should work on and make sure they have mastered the right attitude. Once you have read the full lesson, We will be having the discussion concerning the same in our next session. Write down if you have any questions or key observations from the lesson. 

Happy learning!
21/07/22, 22:35 - Pardon EWYL22E0112: Good day
21/07/22, 22:41 - Unknown: Let us talk about your Wednesday lesson now,
It actually taught me a lesson that *Blaming others does not yield any fruitful outcome.*
21/07/22, 23:03 - Pardon EWYL22E0112: Yes  unsuccessful people will always find a thing to blame not checking where they cld hv gone wrong
22/07/22, 18:19 - Unknown: My key takeaway points are that we should not scapegoat our failures but beginning take responsibility for all the shortcomings we encounter in our day to day living. If negligence is prolonged it might as well turn out to an individual feeling the impossibility to succeed thus, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy that failure is unavoidable anyway. Whilst on the other hand, successful people accept failure for what it is and learn from their mistakes and do something about it. They understand that there is no shortcut to success and one can work hard with little to no achievement sometimes and this could be payback time for all the time spent in neglect. But,  however this should not deter  one from working hard and diligently
` `
In summation, I have learnt that i should work hard and diligently, stay positive and committed, embrace failure for what it is.
22/07/22, 18:19 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian,
Time to get ready for new opportunities!
22/07/22, 23:57 - Pardon EWYL22E0112: Good day maam
23/07/22, 18:29 - Unknown: Give your day meaning by setting a goal. Then, work towards achieving that goal. Wishing you a very good morning!

Also, a reminder today you will receive your *SATURDAY ACTIVITY*  be ready!
23/07/22, 18:30 - Unknown: Edoofian,
I am really curious for this one question from your newsletter, how does your perfect day look like?
Can you please answer this for me in a detailed manner , I would love to know that!
25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:34 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off

17/08/22, 18:21 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
Hope you are doing well!

Let me educate you about the Indian independence day which was yesterday due to which we had a long weekend!
Independence Day, in India, is a national holiday celebrated annually on August 15. Independence Day marks the end of British rule in 1947 and the establishment of a free and independent Indian nation. It also marks the anniversary of the partition of the subcontinent into two countries, India and Pakistan, which occurred at midnight on August 14–15, 1947.

Isn’t this interesting?
