As August Intake is right at our doorsteps, So due to this many of our Edoofians will be arriving here in India to kick start their dream journey.?

I feel that it is my duty to make sure that the university has prepared well for their onboarding process.

This is why I would be visiting the universities Today in order to do a personal check up.
Since, This process would take up lots of time that is why we won't be able to connect Today.
However, I am sure that in my absence, You will make sure that you follow the below given things:

1. Make sure to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual at 9 AM Tomorrow.
2. Do submit the Wednesday Lesson before the deadline.

In the past couple of days, You might have noticed that I was not very active on the EWYL DEDICATED LINE.

This was due to Arrival of 72 Edoofians who came this week.
I am very happy to inform you that all of them are settled and are busy with exploring the universities. ?

Today is the last day of their Admission Processes, So I would be visiting the universities to make sure everything goes well.

We will be starting our regular sessions with full flow from *Monday*.
Till then, I would like you to work on the *EWYL PROJECTS*.

Also, Make sure that you perform the *Proud Edoofian* Ritual on the *EWYL DEDICATED LINE* on Saturday and Sunday as well.
The chain should not break.

Have a blessed day ahead⭐
