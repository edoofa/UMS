18/09/23, 16:23 - Ananya: Go to Facebook and search for "Student Communities in Zimbabwe"
Join a relevant group from the appeared results.
Share information about Edoofa and include the WhatsApp group link.
Interested individuals can join the group and connect with you.
Communicate with them and provide further details about Edoofa.

18/09/23, 16:26 - Ananya: Amazing, now once you will make the group. 
So for community building:
1) Keep the group updated DAILY.
2) Try reaching out to students from different schools
3) Try reaching out to teachers from your school or others and ask them to share the link to your WhatsApp group with other school teachers from different schools
4) In the group just:
-please give 'only admins' access
-just ask the students/participants to DM you to know about Edoofa and to get the form
-once they DM you, share about Edoofa with them
-Before sharing the form, ask them to get you added to their school groups
-once they do that, then only share the form with them.‚Äã

28/09/23, 17:02 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0267: Perfect thank you will do so and send the speech
