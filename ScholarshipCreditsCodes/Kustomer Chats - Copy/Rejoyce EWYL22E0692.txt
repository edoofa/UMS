13/12/22, 19:31 - Tenzin: Effective and timely feedback is a crucial part of a successful performance, as I discussed with you in our Saturday activity. Before our Session , I wanted to get in touch with you to share your EWYL report card and ask you to evaluate your performance by responding to the following questions:

1. How would you rate your performance from 1-10, 10 being the highest score?
2. What is your goal- in terms of skills and amount of scholarship credits that you want to earn?
3. What is your plan- how will you achieve the above mentioned goal?

The answers you give here will be evaluated by Ms Deepali and Ms Davi. So take you time and share your responses here in the group itself before our session.

17/12/22, 21:22 - Tenzin: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, 
_I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?_

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!

19/12/22, 21:05 - Rejoyce EWYL22E0692: I would like to be the secret Santa for my sister's son called Keith .He is one of my favorite and charming.The reason why I want to be his secret Santa is that he believes so much in Santa and it is one of his greatest dreams to receive a present from Santa.He believes in such things of puting a teeth under his pillow and receive a Christmas gift.That is why I want to be his secret Santa this festive season.The gift I am going to give him is a new truck toy because he is a fan of toys .

04/01/23, 23:41 - Tenzin: *Wednesday Lesson | 4 Jan*

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy learning.

05/01/23, 18:40 - Rejoyce EWYL22E0692: From the Wednesday lesson i can use this skills for the EWYL projects in the sense that I can start by building friendship relationships with my fellow colleagues at school for the liking principle.Once they like me they will be persuaded and influenced by what I say for example when informing them about edoofa.I can also try to be authoritative and influential at school and in the community.I can try to be given a higher position at school for example become a senior prefect.This will make my fellow colleagues persuaded in with my words.Also this might also work when reaching out to companies.For the reciprocity principal I will inform my fellow colleagues and schools about the scholarship credits this will make them for attracted and more wanting to be a part of us .
