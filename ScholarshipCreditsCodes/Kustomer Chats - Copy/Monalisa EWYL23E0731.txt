Your journal can be a canvas for your dreams, fears, aspirations, and daily experiences. When sharing your journal, feel free to discuss your insights, challenges, and any personal growth you may have experienced through the process.

I believe that this activity will not only enhance your writing skills but also nurture your emotional intelligence and self-awareness. I look forward to reading and discussing your journal entries during our upcoming session. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Happy journaling!
06/11/23, 12:41 - Monalisa EWYL23E0731: My Journal

I thought of writing about my life experience till now as Mr L Mutudza's daughter.As I grew up l grew up with many relatives children living with my family.When I was in my primary level whenever I wrote end of year exams or ZIMSEC exams l never finished the exam because of a headache.My family had taken it lightly as a general headache.During the Corona years I engaged into a girl prayer group which was led by Mr and Mrs Mafweda along with Father Mashoko.They taught us, to pray and put God first in life.As days passed l started to have dreams of old people hunting, either talking about my family or planning against the family.I told my sis and she said l should tell our parents, when I did tell them they did not take me seriously because they knew me as the child who was not into church.I then told Mr Mafweda and he translated to my sister.That was the every day my sister told me about our family.I never thought that my father's siblings and their families never talked together.My father's sister seemed nice on her photos ,the only thing that separated her from my family was her wrong thoughts about my family.She thought because her elder brother's family maltreated her then her little brother's family can do so.Now she  got helped by my mother on her chest problem which has been bothering her for years ,she now believes that we are one family,but my father's brother's family is the difficult one they have this hatred for us that I don't get.My priority is to make my parents happy allow with my siblings and reuniting the family.My father's late friend as always called me an engineer since my early days and it has been my dream ,l will be the first girl in the entire family to do something which isn't basic like, Chef, teacher or lawyer.My parents say I should stand up for myself and my desires and I will conquer without difficulty with God by my side.

18/11/23, 14:42 - Monalisa EWYL23E0731: SATURDAY ACTIVITY
18/11/23, 14:49 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
18/11/23, 15:08 - Monalisa EWYL23E0731: Most of my life everything that happens to me has been a lesson that is helping me lately.I remember an incident that happened when I was at the age of twelve .Me and my family went for a Conference.My parents have a leadership part at church so many people know them for helping others especially those in need.l shared a tent with my mom and my little brother at night.Once I was sleeping I felt someone touching my body in an unusual way,that person came on top of me while touching me ,by then I had no idea of what he was doing so l didn't move then someone opened the tent that's how he stopped touching me.I didn't see his face but I knew his scent. I didn't tell anyone about this incident till now because I don't know what he did to me was wrong.I started to hate going to church because of that incident l also felt disgusted with my body l felt unclean in front of God, but likely I got help from my mentor Father Mashoko.If he did not encourage me in being what l am today now I pray,fast and believe that they is a God up there.I always wanted to seek revenge on the guy who took advantage of my age for a long time but now I can't because God exposed him now he is in jail because he raped an underaged girl.
