Hence we must treat it important that we treat our Time as the currency of life. *Time Management* is essentially Priority Management.

1. How managing time is necessary

How are you?
12/10/22, 01:23 - Unknown: In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. 
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic *\" Study In India\"*
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. Those unfamiliar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
In today's session on the EWYL Line, we will discuss:
1. your video
2.  project analysis

Please excuse me for the delay caused in the session, I was got occupied with some personal engagements.
I hope we can continue now.

13/10/22, 01:20 - Unknown: We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real-life example. That is how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because in the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.
Responses will be submitted on the EWYL Line only.

Happy Learning.
