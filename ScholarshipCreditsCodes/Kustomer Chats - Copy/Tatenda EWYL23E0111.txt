From the next session onwards, as per our Academic Board of Edoofa, please make sure that you share your responses before the session begins. Responses shared after the session, will not be given feedback.
16/06/23, 16:04 - Tatenda EWYL23E0111: Noted..
16/06/23, 16:04 - Tatenda EWYL23E0111: Greetings of the day maam
16/06/23, 16:05 - Saloni Rastogi: You have not received the Wednesday lesson, I know that Tatenda. But you did you wonder why?
16/06/23, 16:07 - Tatenda EWYL23E0111: No l haven't received the Wednesday lesson ma'am .
16/06/23, 16:07 - Tatenda EWYL23E0111: Yes l did wonder ma'am
16/06/23, 16:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Okay, let me tell you. We have to follow the daily ritual every DAY in the morning.
16/06/23, 16:18 - Saloni Rastogi: Since you did not follow the daily ritual on the 14th, that is Wednesday, you did not receive the lesson.
16/06/23, 16:20 - Saloni Rastogi: No worries, I will share the lesson in the later half of the session.
16/06/23, 16:20 - Saloni Rastogi: For now, I am very impressed with your understanding on community building project.
16/06/23, 16:21 - Saloni Rastogi: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
16/06/23, 16:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Mentor-  *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You‚Äôre supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*

For eg: In your case, it will be-

*Tatenda/Saloni/16JUNE2023*
16/06/23, 16:22 - Saloni Rastogi: EP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
16/06/23, 16:22 - Saloni Rastogi: STEP 2*
16/06/23, 16:22 - Saloni Rastogi: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
16/06/23, 16:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
16/06/23, 16:29 - Tatenda EWYL23E0111: Noted ma'am .l will now follow the daily ritual
16/06/23, 16:46 - Saloni Rastogi: That is great Tatenda!
Can you share if you have understood the process that I explained for the community building?
19/06/23, 12:07 - Tatenda EWYL23E0111: I have to create a WhatsApp group and name its 
*Tatenda/Saloni/16JUNE2022*
 The students are well equipped with with information about Edoofa .
19/06/23, 12:08 - Tatenda EWYL23E0111: I have to send the link to my former class mates to spread the information
19/06/23, 12:21 - Tatenda EWYL23E0111: üì¢ Hello, students! It's time for our exciting weekend activity! üéâ This week, we dived into the captivating world of entrepreneurship, exploring the remarkable stories of four inspirational entrepreneurs. I'm confident that you have thoroughly researched and read about each of them in detail.

Now, I invite you to reflect on the entrepreneurs we discussed and share your favorite among them. In 200 words, I encourage you to highlight two similarities and two dissimilarities between yourself and your chosen entrepreneur.

As you analyze these similarities and differences, consider various aspects such as their journey, mindset, values, and achievements. Remember, this activity is an opportunity for self-reflection and to identify areas where you can draw inspiration or learn from these exceptional individuals.

By examining the similarities, you may discover shared traits, passions, or aspirations, creating a sense of connection and motivation. Exploring the differences can help you recognize unique qualities and perspectives, encouraging you to embrace your own individuality and strengths.

So, take your time, think deeply, and express your thoughts in a well-crafted 200-word response. Feel free to share your insights, and let the inspiration from these entrepreneurs propel you towards your own entrepreneurial dreams.

Wishing you a thought-provoking and fulfilling weekend activity! Enjoy the process of discovering more about yourself and the entrepreneurs who have left a lasting impact on the world.
Please excuse me for the delay, I was occupied in some urgent family commitments.

28/06/23, 16:40 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

Team EWYL

Let us look back when Edoofa proudly joins the continent in celebrating Africa Day, a day filled with unity, pride, and the vibrant spirit of Africa!

We are honored to have such incredible Edoofians from across Africa, each one representing the rich diversity, talent, and brilliance that the continent possesses. Drop your feelings in the comments below!
29/06/23, 16:42 - Tatenda EWYL23E0111: Done
30/06/23, 16:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Tatenda!
How are you?
Please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' for today.
30/06/23, 16:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù
30/06/23, 16:06 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
30/06/23, 16:07 - Tatenda EWYL23E0111: I am a proud Edoofian .
