18/10/23, 17:43 - Praise EWYL23E0716: Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am Praise Chizema and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Praise EWYL23E0716
19/10/23, 13:01 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.

05/11/23, 05:31 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofians, hope you are doing well.

As part of your Saturday Activity, I encourage each one of you to dedicate some time to journaling for just one day. Let your thoughts flow freely onto the pages, expressing your feelings, ideas, and observations. Take this opportunity to delve deep within yourself and discover what truly matters to you. Your journal can be a canvas for your dreams, fears, aspirations, and daily experiences. When sharing your journal, feel free to discuss your insights, challenges, and any personal growth you may have experienced through the process.

I believe that this activity will not only enhance your writing skills but also nurture your emotional intelligence and self-awareness. I look forward to reading and discussing your journal entries during our upcoming session. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Happy journaling!

How are you doing today?

09/11/23, 13:21 - Ananya: So, Praise were you able to communicate with the admissions team?
09/11/23, 13:22 - Praise EWYL23E0716: I am sorry my mentor for not attending my  sessions ,it seems like l had lost the opportunity to pursue my dreams with Edoofa due to financial hardships
09/11/23, 13:22 - Praise EWYL23E0716: Not yet
09/11/23, 13:29 - Ananya: Praise, I understand that however, I would still suggest you have a discussion with the admissions team, I am sure they will help you with that.
09/11/23, 13:30 - Praise EWYL23E0716: Okay
09/11/23, 13:31 - Praise EWYL23E0716: Thank you for being there for me
09/11/23, 13:36 - Ananya: You know, we are celebrating Diwali here in India! Let me share our Diwali special Wednesday Wisdom with you!
09/11/23, 13:36 - Ananya: .
09/11/23, 13:37 - Praise EWYL23E0716: Thank you
09/11/23, 13:46 - Ananya: Kindly read it, and share what have you discovered.
09/11/23, 14:27 - Ananya: I want to inform you that I'll be away from 10th Oct to 13th Oct, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). ðŸª”âœ¨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on Thursday at 9:30 a.m. once the echoes of fireworks settle down.
09/11/23, 14:27 - Ananya: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets excitingâ€”I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me before Tuesdayâ€”it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! ðŸª”âœ¨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! ðŸŽ‰
09/11/23, 14:29 - Ananya: .
18/11/23, 16:17 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one â€“ it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!

21/12/23, 12:58 - Ananya: Good morning,Praise!

Let us begin our session with a thought! Have you ever wondered why Santa doesn't get a parking ticket on Christmas Eve? It turns out he has 'Sleigh Parking Only' privileges and his reindeer are excellent at navigating the skies without worrying about traffic laws. It seems Santa's got connections in high places â€“ or should I say, the North Pole!" ðŸŽ…âœ¨
21/12/23, 13:06 - Praise EWYL23E0716: Good morning to you too 

 I guess Santa must have special privileges as the world's most famous Christmas gift-giver. It's interesting to think about the logistics of how he manages to visit so many homes in one night. Perhaps his reindeer have some magical powers too!
21/12/23, 13:29 - Ananya: Absolutely, so Praise may I ask if you were able to connect with the admissions team?
21/12/23, 13:33 - Praise EWYL23E0716: Yes Ma'am,and they said as for now we have put your schoolarship seat on hold
21/12/23, 13:38 - Ananya: Why Praise?
21/12/23, 14:22 - Praise EWYL23E0716: Due to financial constraints
21/12/23, 14:23 - Ananya: Alright, what are you parents suggesting?
21/12/23, 14:36 - Ananya: I was expecting a response from your end, however since our session is over let us connect in our next session, which is on Monday. Meanwhile do not forget to follow your EWYL ritual of saying " I am a proud Edoofian" on your EWYL LIne daily.
