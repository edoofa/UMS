I hope that you are in good health and spirits
12/07/22, 20:38 - Unknown: I hope that you have seen my messages on the EWYL Group?
13/07/22, 04:39 - Lovemore EWYL21E0921: *Saturday Activity* 

I think every organisation , every legal entity that has a motive to achieve its goals and is focused on producing the best results would want to recruit a team that is strong and productive  . 

Hence if anyone wishes to be part of such a team . One needs to show good workmanship which comes in ways that i intend to list.
One of the important qualities is reliance or dependability.  This comes with being able to show commitment and consistency. On top of that if people are to depend on you they would want a person who is always on time . One who delivers when given a duty and delivers in time.
 Good workmanship also comes with a great character which is denoted by good communication skills with respect to position and protocol of work. Sometimes speech and presentations needs to be given with humility irrespective of the position one holds. Character is also shown in respect to how one presents themselves amongst others.
13/07/22, 04:48 - Lovemore EWYL21E0921: Yes sir
13/07/22, 04:52 - Unknown: Lovemore, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.
This way you will always be recognized by the Academics Board for new projects.
13/07/22, 04:54 - Lovemore EWYL21E0921: Yes that is true sir
13/07/22, 04:54 - Lovemore EWYL21E0921: I will try my best
25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
17/08/22, 09:50 - Lovemore EWYL21E0921: How are you sir
17/08/22, 16:05 - Lovemore EWYL21E0921: Humanity is  a myth . The physics , the biology and the psychology. What makes this generation unique is we are living in a time where mystery is discovering mystery which makes the whole mystery mysterious.  In all the noise , the movement , the hustle and the innovation in the global networking, i am proud to point out that there are people who have managed to focus on what they chose become and achieved their goal with honesty and hardwork . Such people remain my heroes till the day i leave this earth. Dr Myles Munroe said \" *One of the most unhappy man on this earth is a man without vision and one of the most  disappointed man on this earth is a man whose vision never come pass* \"
This saying has driven me since the day i have had it. It has touched a part of my life that used to lie docile , my imagination.  I never wanted to dream because i told myself that dreams never come true. It is better to stay without dreams so that you won't be disappointed but then i realised through Dr Myles that if you dont dream you will die an unhappy man . So i decided to dream and create the dream into reality so that i die a happy man . I created my vision and it has taken me this far. The road is rather not close to the end but i am convinced that the story ends when i say so because i was given the power to write it. 

Dr Myles Munroe has been my model and though he is late his books remain walking amongst us and they have transformed a part of my life. I can't wait to create a better story for tommorrow everyday i wake up.
This year i have adopted a code that says \" *When drawing your image don't let anyone hold the pen* \"
I am doing my best to create the best image of myself that i can and i hope and believe that there is still a lot to my story to be told and to be lived but for now i write to this end.

06/01/23, 00:38 - Unknown: Since You have not performed the Proud Edoofian Ritual yesterday morning, Therefore, I was not able to share the Wednesday Lesson with you.
06/01/23, 00:38 - Unknown: *Wednesday Lesson | 4 Jan*

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy Learning!
06/01/23, 00:40 - Unknown: I am sure that you are aware that we have our session Tomorrow.
Feel free to share any queries that you have, We will be discussing their detail in our session tomorrow. Also, Make sure that YOU reach out to me 5 mins prior to our session.

Have a cheerful day ahead!

13/01/23, 16:40 - Lovemore EWYL21E0921: Good morning. I am a proud Edoofian.
13/01/23, 16:42 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
