01/10/22, 17:16 - Russell EWYL22E0373: Yes ma'am. Church today so I'm probably thrilled, because its always a long awaited day when the week starts.
01/10/22, 17:16 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
