Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off

I have written a few pointers with each topic for your help.
20/10/22, 16:49 - Tenzin: Also, Yesterday because we were discussing the Testimonial Task, I refrained from sharing the Wednesday Lesson with you because I thought it would be too much information for one session.
Therefore I am sharing the Wednesday Lesson with you Today.
Also, Since, I am sharing this one day late, I am extending the deadline to Saturday at 9 AM from Friday at 6 PM.
20/10/22, 16:49 - Tenzin: Hello, My Proud Edoofian.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

Hello My Proud Edoofian

Hope you’re doing well. We know most of you have your exams going on since we got a lot of emails to continue after the exams. While we appreciate that students like you are taking on the responsibility to be accountable for your unavailability, we need to ensure that the emails shared have to be in the right format. 
Email writing is a skill that each professional must possess. An email should be written with an intent to share information formally with your colleagues\/seniors\/mentors etc. 
In today’s activity, we want you to write an email sharing your exam schedule and your date of rejoining the EWYL sessions. 
Also attach your exam schedule\/date sheet as a part of the email.

For the one’s who are yet to start with their exams or don’t have them ongoing, write an email addressing your mentor about what has been their contribution in shaping your career so far and one thing that you want to learn from them. Please mention specific information.

Please feel free to discuss if you have any queries with your mentors. 
You have to email it to : deepali@edoofa.com
