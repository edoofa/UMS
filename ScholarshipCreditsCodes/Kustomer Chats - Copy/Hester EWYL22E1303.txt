13/03/23, 19:19 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

16/03/23, 01:09 - Saloni Rastogi: It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
16/03/23, 01:09 - Saloni Rastogi: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

17/03/23, 21:54 - Hester EWYL22E1303: Good Afternoon 
I am fine
17/03/23, 22:04 - Hester EWYL22E1303: Thank you so much for the opportunity .Firstly People in the today's society seek money and wealth so that they can be recognized by the society but this can end up leading to stress ,anxiety and even depression .Wealth is defined as an asset that can earn while you sleep .This means that the value of your assets continues to grow and multiply even when you are not working or earning.Furthermore one a should create assets that generate income that is passive .For instance the income should support the family and the next generation .Lastly money is a tool  we use to transfer time and wealth .This means money is a medium for exchange .
17/03/23, 22:30 - Hester EWYL22E1303: Okay thank you
17/03/23, 22:34 - Saloni Rastogi: You have concluded the understanding of the lesson so well. Even my learning has been that 'Money is simply a tool that we use to transfer time and wealth, and that status is not a measure of true success or happiness. Instead, focus on building wealth and creating a life that brings you joy and fulfillment.' 
And you know _earning scholarship credits_ is just parallel to creating that joy and fulfillment and aiming higher by seeing how much you have earned and beating all the records.
17/03/23, 22:34 - Saloni Rastogi: Did the Headmaster tell you the time for the interacting?
17/03/23, 22:35 - Hester EWYL22E1303: Okay noted

17/03/23, 22:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, try searching for contacts of other headmasters on Social Media platforms.
17/03/23, 22:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me share with you how our star performer for last week-Loice did complete her targets.
She shared three schools and you know she got to know about them through Google.
She simply searched on Google like 'School nearby'\/'School in Harare'\/'School in Manicaland' and so on. She was able to yield result. 
So even without physically visiting them, she got to know about them through Google, got heir contact details and after that got in touch with them Via WhatsApp.
17/03/23, 22:55 - Hester EWYL22E1303: Okay l connected with him but his network is down so he is not clearly hearing me
17/03/23, 22:56 - Hester EWYL22E1303: So l can get in contact with any other headmaster
17/03/23, 23:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, get their contact, share the introduction message with them as well.
Once they revert back, share this information with them that I am sharing with you.
17/03/23, 23:09 - Saloni Rastogi: The information that I am sharing now might a lot of information at one, so try to grasp it slowly and in case you have any concerns, let me know.
17/03/23, 23:09 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education   All.
17/03/23, 23:10 - Saloni Rastogi: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of lack of affordability and of employability in higher education. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!
17/03/23, 23:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Edoofa is a social for-profit organization that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!
17/03/23, 23:11 - Saloni Rastogi: Edoofa scholarship program is currently helping over 100 schools in Africa, and over 3000 African students are benefiting from our scholarship program.

Now, to help the students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation, Edoofa has its own Earn While You Learn Program, which helps the students to learn skills and earn money in the form of scholarship credits to reduce their expenses.
17/03/23, 23:11 - Saloni Rastogi: Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his\/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. With the quality of education provided to the student completing high school, edoofa would want to transform your school’s every student into a person who’s so strong in the knowledge that he\/she becomes better than his\/her peers. Coupled with the Earn While you Learn program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he\/she has got more opportunities to chase him\/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development\/growth.
17/03/23, 23:12 - Saloni Rastogi: Now, It is time to explain with examples How Edoofa is revolutionizing the Education System on the African Continent. Examples create clarity. This is why they are used in all contexts as a tool to provide further understanding. When it comes to your conversation, examples play a significant role in your ability to effectively communicate the elements that you want the School Head to understand.
17/03/23, 23:12 - Saloni Rastogi: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year.

Till then, have great day?
18/03/23, 20:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings *my proud edoofian*!

Here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!
