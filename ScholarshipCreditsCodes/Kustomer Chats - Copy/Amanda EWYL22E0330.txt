15/07/22, 22:21 - Amanda EWYL22E0330: Well Patrice Motsepe was able to achieve greatness by being 
1 . Observant 
He observed  a lot of men who came to his father's spaza to buy liquor were mine workers. This gave him exposure to the  mining industry and the business world in general.

2 Education 
Patrice studied law in Swaziland and attained a degree . He came back to South Africa and utilised his skills by channeling his profession to work hand to hand with the mining sector.

3 Innovative and business minded
Patrice built up a mine company or firm called African Rainbow minerals .
4 Goal oriented and Perseverance 
He bought a mine from Anglo mine which was at the verge of collapsing  and was able to make it a great mining giant in 3 years .

5 He formed relations with large companies thus creating a good legacy .
 
6 He was able to attain a good title and was able to leave a mark as one of the richest men in Africa.
15/07/22, 23:59 - Unknown: Amazing work on the Lesson task. I saw that Patrice had the wisdom to recognize and grab the opportunities that time brought for him and that is what set him apart from others and made him who he is.

19/07/22, 00:01 - Unknown: Amazing to read your response for the weekend activity. I like how you chose this particular industry and how you have explained about it's growth in the time to come. Keep it up.
19/07/22, 00:01 - Unknown: Let me first help you understand what SWOT Analysis is.

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment.This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organizations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
19/07/22, 00:02 - Amanda EWYL22E0330: Thank you sir
19/07/22, 00:03 - Amanda EWYL22E0330: Thank you for the detailed definition Sir
19/07/22, 00:23 - Unknown: As seen above, SWOT is an acronym of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. However, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym:

1 Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
2 Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
3 Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
4 Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by
19/07/22, 00:26 - Amanda EWYL22E0330: Yes sir .Thank you
19/07/22, 00:46 - Unknown: You know why SWOT Analysis is important? It can help you to challenge risky assumptions and to uncover dangerous blindspots about your organization's performance. If you use it carefully and collaboratively, it can deliver new insights on where your business currently is, and help you to develop exactly the right strategy for any situation.
19/07/22, 00:46 - Unknown: For example, Amanda, you may be well aware of some of your organization's strengths, but until you record them alongside weaknesses and threats you might not realize how unreliable those strengths actually are.

Equally, you likely have reasonable concerns about some of your business weaknesses but, by going through the analysis systematically, you could find an opportunity, previously overlooked, that could more than compensate.
19/07/22, 00:57 - Amanda EWYL22E0330: Ok sir
19/07/22, 00:57 - Amanda EWYL22E0330: Thank you sir
19/07/22, 01:08 - Unknown: Now Amanda, What Are the Biggest SWOT Analysis Mistakes people make?
19/07/22, 01:49 - Unknown: Here are some mistakes that I believe people make Amanda.
1 Making your lists too long. Ask yourself if your ideas are feasible as you go along.
2 Being vague. Be specific to provide more focus for later discussions.
3. Not seeing weaknesses. Be sure to ask customers and colleagues what they experience in real life.
4. Not thinking ahead. It's easy to come up with nice ideas without taking them through to their logical conclusion. Always consider their practical impact.
5 Being unrealistic. Don't plan in detail for opportunities that don't exist yet.
19/07/22, 01:52 - Amanda EWYL22E0330: Some of the SWOT analysis mistakes are :

~Overestimating Strengths.
~Generalizing Factors. 
~ Brushing Over Weaknesses.
19/07/22, 01:52 - Amanda EWYL22E0330: Ok thank you sir
19/07/22, 02:48 - Unknown: Interesting Amanda, good .
