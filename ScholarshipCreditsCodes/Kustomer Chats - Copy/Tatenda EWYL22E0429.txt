16/07/22, 00:33 - Tatenda EWYL22E0429: Greetings ma'am
16/07/22, 00:37 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"


Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these at
16/07/22, 00:41 - Tatenda EWYL22E0429: I am a proud EDOOFIAN.
16/07/22, 00:42 - Jasmine Kaur: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

To develop this mindset of taking responsibility for everything and avoiding the blame game takes time and focus. As your Saturday Assignment your are required to write a short write up, on the growth mindset of successful people and how will you make sure you develop the same mindset. The word limit for this assignment is 150-200 words. Kindly make sure you follow the word limit strictly, any responses less than the minimum word limit will not be marked.

24/07/22, 19:38 - Tatenda EWYL22E0429: Good morning ma'am. May you please help me to understand more on the topic about my assignment.
24/07/22, 20:07 - Tatenda EWYL22E0429: ~*Growth mindset of successful people*~

Most life changes facilitate the change of human behaviour while change in human behaviour also facilitates life changes. The mind is a powerful place and thus a positive mindset facilitates success. Successful people are all characterised by a similar mindset which has the following traits: 
(1) Being open-minded.
(2) Setting up challenges and goals to accomplish in a given time.
(3) Ready to accept lose and the fact that life is not one-sided.
(4) Not scared to make business risks like investments.
(5) Critical thinking.
(6) Improvising.

Other than propelling in business and their careers, successful people always prioritize good relationships, good health, safety and creative expressions to improve happiness.

Inorder to achieve success and to propell my career in the right direction I intend to follow the good traits shown by most successful people. I will make this possible by setting up limits and standards for myself which are to high to reach. This will help me to be more occupied with improving my career such that I become successful before I realize it. Most people usually limit their dreams to reality which makes their aspirations to be too small. 

Last but not least, I believe that I can make it and that alone is a good attitude which can help me realize my dreams. The mind is a powerful place and what one feeds it will affect them in a powerful way, so feeding the mind with possibility and positivity will actually will actually create possibilities.
24/07/22, 20:28 - Tatenda EWYL22E0429: Ma'am I have added you to the Edoofa group for the community building group.
25/07/22, 03:18 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

 I am waiting for your answer and then I will share my understanding \/ opinion about them.
25/07/22, 23:11 - Tatenda EWYL22E0429: 1. I will use my constant belief in good attitude to  push myself into working harder on the betterment of the whole Edoofa community. I will work harder in my projects and manage my time wisely to help raise the flag of Edoofa.
2. To make sure that everyone feels the oneness of the community, I am going to prioritize good relationships with my fellow Edoofians.
25/07/22, 23:15 - Jasmine Kaur: I am apologetic Tatenda, I just checked your response
25/07/22, 23:16 - Jasmine Kaur: I would like to add to what you mentioned   Actions that are based on the principles of Oneness are rewarding in the sense that they fill us with happiness and joy, whether or not you get your desired results. Just the act of committing to the effort makes us feel connected to everything and can help heal isolation, loneliness, and helplessness.

I realised as soon as I started reading this lesson that most of my students needed to learn and grasp this. One person succeeding and one failing depends solely on how effectively they manage their time. Try to comprehend and apply the measures discussed in the lesson to your everyday life. I'll be here to help you, so that you can focus on learning how to manage your time effectively. In our following session, please explain in detail what you learned from the lesson.Also, do not forget to send *I am a proud edoofian* tomorrow.
