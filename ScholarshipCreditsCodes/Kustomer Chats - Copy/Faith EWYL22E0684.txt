03/11/22, 15:16 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Hope you are well.
08/11/22, 22:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Since you typed three, let me clarify it to you.
08/11/22, 22:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
08/11/22, 22:48 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
09/11/22, 00:15 - Faith EWYL22E0684: Thamk you Maam for sharing.But my network is low to fill the form

Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their personality traits made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.

In our session on the EWYL Line, we will discuss:
1) your views on the Wednesday Wisdom

How are you?
11/11/22, 14:41 - Saloni Rastogi: Well, on Wednesday Wisdom, I got reminded of one quote:

“There comes a time when you look into the mirror and you realize that what you see is all that you will ever be. And then you accept it. Or you kill yourself. Or you stop looking in mirrors.”
― J. Michael Straczynski

It touched me completely.
It means that whenever we look into the mirror, we should not think of ourselves as anything. And if we are thinking of ourselves as something, then it should be worthy and competent enough.
11/11/22, 14:41 - Saloni Rastogi: Faith, we recently finished with the discussion on the three projects right?
Let me share the document with you for clarity.
11/11/22, 14:42 - Saloni Rastogi: I talking about the projects out of these three.

How are you?

As I believe, the more you know yourself, the clearer your vision of the world and your mind gets. You were given a link to a personality test, which you must have taken up this week, and are all ready to share your response via a screenshot with me in your session. 

Link to the Test: -
https:\/\/my-personality-test.com\/true-colours
15/11/22, 00:57 - Saloni Rastogi: In our session:
1) we will discuss the personality mark you received

And yes, I have chosen my Edoofian of the week for the last week (07-12) of November and it is Mihlayonke Ndlovu. We will be having a live conversation on his journey so far and yes, this video will be streamed on the YouTube channel of Edoofa and will be viewed by 5-10 thousand students and parents. 
I hope you are ready to be featured in my next Edoofian of the week video (for this week).
For that, we have to work hard and be consistent.
15/11/22, 00:58 - Saloni Rastogi: `Sorry Maam lam not understanding here,on number 1) there is S and number 2) the is f,what does that mean`

How are you?
15/11/22, 17:51 - Saloni Rastogi: Even I received a golden badge, BINGO!!
15/11/22, 17:51 - Saloni Rastogi: You are very detail-oriented and love to plan. You are very predictable and responsible, which gives you a sense of security in life. You rarely do anything unpredictable or unplanned.

You also value history and tradition. You hold your family’s shared beliefs very closely and have a high moral standard. You enjoy finding ways to live out these values in various ways throughout your life, whether that be through helping others by volunteering or through your career. You enjoy having others rely on you to help.

You enjoy being the best at what you do and believe there is a right way to do everything. Others would describe you as a “rule-follower” who “does things by the book”.  Because of this, you can also become pushy and judgmental when you don’t agree with others’ decisions.

Because of their need for structure, security, and predictability, those whose true color is gold do well in jobs that are very straightforward and have highly defined duties.  You enjoy knowing what your tasks will be for the day, and would not perform well in highly unpredictable careers. Gold individuals are well-suited for careers in finance or public service.
15/11/22, 17:52 - Saloni Rastogi: This is what the golden badge means.

16/11/22, 22:09 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, my dear proud Edoofian. I hope all is well with you.

Another insightful Wednesday Wisdom is presented here. The lesson today teaches us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, disability. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition. A few questions near the end of the session will ask you to reflect and have an open dialogue with yourself. After you finish your lesson, as your mentor, I'd like to have a thorough conversation about your key take aways, in our upcoming sessions.

Enjoy the article and keep in mind that success does not come to you suddenly; rather, it can be attained over time by making modest, daily improvements.

Happy learning!

The Wednesday lesson taught us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, _disability_. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition.

In our session, we will discuss:
1) your understanding of how disability is different from what we thought about it earlier
2) progress on the projects
