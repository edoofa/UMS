12/03/23, 18:23 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well

The feedback we have received from some of you on this week’s Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.
As part of this week’s Saturday Activity, you are required to share your written submission on : 
What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?
There is no word limit, so feel free to express your understanding in detail. The second answer requires some mental work, so sit with yourself, introspect, and share your honest answer with your mentor. 
Let this activity play an important role in your personal goal setting. We will connect soon in our upcoming session. 
Till then, happy learning and happy growing!
14/03/23, 22:11 - Moreblessing EWYL22E0948: Question
What is a North  Star Metric, and how does it help a business stay focused on their goals

A North Star Metric is a single key performance indicator that represents the most important goal for a business. It helps a business stay focused by ensuring a company's overall success and serve as a guidepost for decision making and prioritization of a company's goals.

Question 2

As a student what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth

As a student my North Star Metric could be Learning mastery. This represents my ability to master and understand what I learn . Moreso, another important part of my metric could be implementing what l learn i.e putting it into act, for instance a law student can establish a law firm

 Did you check the Instagram reel on our page?
17/03/23, 21:12 - Moreblessing EWYL22E0948: Not yet but I will
17/03/23, 21:14 - Jasmine Kaur: Sure
17/03/23, 21:15 - Moreblessing EWYL22E0948: Yes ma'am
17/03/23, 21:16 - Jasmine Kaur: I would like to inquire about your preferred living arrangement while studying. When it comes to choosing between staying in a hostel or living outside campus, what factors do you consider in making your decision?
17/03/23, 21:20 - Moreblessing EWYL22E0948: I would  prefer living in the hostel , to cut transport cost , living near the school and also there is good security
17/03/23, 21:22 - Moreblessing EWYL22E0948: Also living in the hostel is good since one will find enough time to discuss with other students living in the hostel
17/03/23, 21:23 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes indeed
17/03/23, 21:23 - Jasmine Kaur: Now I am really looking forward to knowing your understanding of this week's lesson. 
So, you may please share your thoughts with me
17/03/23, 21:24 - Moreblessing EWYL22E0948: Sure
17/03/23, 21:28 - Moreblessing EWYL22E0948: Well I have understood that having money or status does not secure happiness , but rather it can cause stress or anxiety.Hence acquiring wealth is better since it  can promote financial stability and success, also wealth can be sustainable for a certain period of time
17/03/23, 21:34 - Jasmine Kaur: It's true that financial stability and success can contribute to a sense of security and peace of mind.
17/03/23, 21:35 - Moreblessing EWYL22E0948: Yeah sure
17/03/23, 21:36 - Jasmine Kaur: Now I want to inquire if you had the chance to attend the webinar yesterday on *what to Know on Your Way to Success*. There was a lot of positive feedback about it, and I was curious to know your thoughts on it if you were able to attend.
17/03/23, 21:37 - Moreblessing EWYL22E0948: No l didn't understand
17/03/23, 21:37 - Moreblessing EWYL22E0948: I mean I didn't attend
17/03/23, 21:44 - Jasmine Kaur: Well, that is sad. But you can definitely check our story on Instagram in which we will be uploading the insides of our session.
17/03/23, 21:44 - Jasmine Kaur: Now Moreblessing, we have to work really hard in March to earn at least 100$.

17/03/23, 21:45 - Moreblessing EWYL22E0948: I will do exactly as you say ma'am
17/03/23, 21:46 - Moreblessing EWYL22E0948: Well I'm supposed to work on projects 2 and 3 but like I told you I have lost information
