19/07/22, 15:08 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

21/07/22, 19:15 - Pious EWYL22E0357: This is a very big and good lesson for me. Not everyone wants your success and don’t listen to the negative thoughts of people, always stay focused and positive. People may blame you for doing the right things but you should also keep on pushing, you should be in a position to be able to choose the best people who can motivate you to achieve the best. Nothing is for free everything comes after sweat and many more lessons, I have learned a lot today sir thank you very much.
21/07/22, 19:15 - Pious EWYL22E0357: This type of information seems to be convidancial in Zimbabwe sir. There seems to be an official secrecy act which prohibits them from providing information because all of them are not replying after I give them the forms and one of my relatives who is a principal told me so.

21/07/22, 21:03 - Pious EWYL22E0357: Nothing much sir I just told them about the program, I started by sending the letter you gave me, to those who responded some thanked me for the information but when I gave them the form for them to fill in the details they nolonger respond.
21/07/22, 21:58 - Unknown: Great, can you share the screenshot of the conversaton so i can analyse it and help you rectify if needed.
21/07/22, 23:48 - Pious EWYL22E0357: Some of the conversation are in Shona sir
22/07/22, 00:19 - Unknown: I see Pious, in this conversation , the principal never responded to you in detail. Right. you should wait for that and try and build trust with the principal first.
22/07/22, 14:08 - Pious EWYL22E0357: Ok sir thank you

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
