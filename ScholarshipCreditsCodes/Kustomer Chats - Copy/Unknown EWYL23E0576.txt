Today's activity is all about showcasing your pride as an Edoofian. We want you to flaunt your badge of honor, that feeling of being a proud Edoofian, and record a short video saying, "I am a proud Edoofian, and here's one reason why." This is your opportunity to share your Edoofian spirit and what makes you proud to be part of our community.

We can't wait to see your videos and hear your stories of Edoofian pride! Remember, this activity is all about celebrating our unique journeys and what makes our community so special‚≠ê

21/11/23, 18:06 - Jasmine Kaur: Happy Wednesday! üåü
Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

25/11/23, 13:35 - Unknown EWYL23E0576: Good morning to you Ms Jasmine. I am here to request for my Saturday activity
25/11/23, 17:12 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL
25/11/23, 17:27 - Unknown EWYL23E0576: Thank you Ms Jasmine I will share
28/11/23, 03:17 - Unknown EWYL23E0576: Spirit of competition 
Individuals and teams who demonstrate a 'competitive spirit' display this by pushing harder than others, demonstrating a higher level of skill, consistently performing at an elevated level, and are the people that others look up to as leaders and role models.
This spirit competition has mainly applied to me in terms of my extra curriculum activity. My father is well known musician in Zimbabwe who plays both bass guitar and acoustic guitar. He has played for many bands and wrote his own jazz music which are well played on the radio and  is being recognised for that. I usually go with him where he will be performing and seeing all the good works that he will be doing. This gave me the courage to start perusing the music path as my extra curriculum activty and he's my role model. I started playing bass guitar when I was in form 3 and my father is the one who taught me. I told myself that I want to be the best bass guitar player unlike my father this is because I rarely see him practicing. I try by all means to make sure that I do my practice everyday since I want to be on top of him. When I started to play in the school band it was an achievement to me and I as happy about that. My first time to play on the stage I had a stage fright and I couldn't play well and I was disappointed with myself. However my father kept on encouraging me to play until now I am playing without fear.

28/11/23, 13:31 - Unknown EWYL23E0576: My project has been operating slowly due to some students who are still in boarding places where the costs of school fees are above $100 like you recommend me of, however I have also managed to convince some of my friends who are in South Afrika to take part in this wonderful opportunity
28/11/23, 13:32 - Jasmine Kaur: It's truly inspiring to hear about your journey in pursuing music as an extracurricular activity and the role of competition in motivating you to excel. Embrace each opportunity as a chance to learn and grow, and remember that setbacks are natural steps in the journey to mastery. If you ever need guidance, feel free to reach out. Keep up the fantastic work!
