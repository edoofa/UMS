17/07/23, 16:00 - Jasmine Kaur: Let me share your activity now.

Are you ready for a super fun Saturday activity? Today, we want you to delve into the fascinating world of inspirational business personalities from your very own country! üåçüöÄ

Here's what you need to do:

Choose an inspirational business personality from your country. It can be an entrepreneur, CEO, innovator, or anyone who has made a significant impact in the business world. Get creative!

Research and gather information about their journey, accomplishments, and the values they stand for. Dive deep into their story and discover what makes them truly inspirational.

Prepare a short presentation or write-up about this extraordinary individual. Highlight their key achievements, their impact on society, and the lessons we can learn from their success.

Get ready to share! Share their story, inspire others, and don't forget to mention why you find them particularly inspiring.

Remember, this activity isn't just about showcasing someone's success‚Äîit's about understanding the power of determination, innovation, and leadership. We can learn so much from these extraordinary individuals and apply their lessons to our own lives.

So, let's make this Saturday a truly inspiring one! Get ready to share your chosen business personality with us, and let's celebrate the brilliance and ingenuity of entrepreneurs from your country!

Have a fantastic time researching, preparing, and inspiring us all. Can't wait to hear about your chosen business personality! üí°üåü
17/07/23, 16:00 - Jasmine Kaur: I want you to quickly answer these questions.

1. What are you currently doing in Community Building?
2. What are you currently doing in African School Education Reform Mission?
3. Discuss the Challenges that you are facing in Community Building.
4. Discuss the Challenges that you are facing in African School Education Reform Mission.
17/07/23, 16:02 - Ashley EWYL22E1236: Thank you.
17/07/23, 16:12 - Ashley EWYL22E1236: 1)I'm still waiting for responses from quite a few. Some are saying they will come back to me after arranging ways to make the money.

2)I'm still looking for the contacts of the heads.

3)A lot are saying it will be very difficult to raise $2000-3000 per year for their education.

4) I haven't found enough time to travel to different schools as I'm traveling a lot these days out of town preparing for my Visa.
17/07/23, 16:17 - Jasmine Kaur: For the third one. Ashley, can you tell me how much it cost when you choose to study in Zimbabwe per year?
17/07/23, 16:24 - Ashley EWYL22E1236: From what I heard, its about $2000-2500
17/07/23, 16:26 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, and how much do you spend every day on food?
17/07/23, 16:37 - Ashley EWYL22E1236: For reference, this one is studying medicine at the University of Zimbabwe.
17/07/23, 16:38 - Ashley EWYL22E1236: He also said that includes food.
17/07/23, 16:43 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, This sums up to around 1300$. 
Now if you pay between 2000-3000$ you will get the chance you visit a new country, meet new people and learn about a new culture. 
If you plan to go to US or UK, that costs you around 20,000$. So which is better spending 1300$ and studying in your country or giving some extra bucks and studying in a whole new country.
17/07/23, 16:46 - Ashley EWYL22E1236: Yeah I understand, but here, affordability will always come first and that differs from each and every family.
17/07/23, 16:52 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, That's fair. So the only solution to this is that you reach out to more students and find the right students who are actually interested to move to abroad and complete their education.
17/07/23, 16:53 - Ashley EWYL22E1236: I will definitely work on thatüíØ
17/07/23, 16:55 - Jasmine Kaur: Is there any other challenge that you would like to discuss Ashley?
17/07/23, 16:57 - Ashley EWYL22E1236: No. I think that's what is holding me back.
17/07/23, 16:58 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, So Think about it and I am sure you can excel
17/07/23, 17:18 - Jasmine Kaur: As we conclude our today's session, I want to take a moment to commend you on the remarkable progress you have made thus far. This journey of yours is filled with immense potential, and I encourage you to give it your all. As we wrap up for today, I would like to remind you that our next session is scheduled for Thursday at 12:00 pm.

Until then, take care, stay motivated, and strive for greatness. Have a wonderful day!
17/07/23, 17:29 - Ashley EWYL22E1236: I hope so.
17/07/23, 19:11 - Jasmine Kaur: Here I am sharing the Newsletter for the week. The topic of the week is Mindset and Creative thinking. Check it out and see what you can learn the most from it.
