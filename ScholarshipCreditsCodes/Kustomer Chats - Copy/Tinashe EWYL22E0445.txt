08/08/22, 18:02 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

How's your day goi?ng
09/08/22, 00:18 - Unknown: You were probably encouraged by this week's featured entrepreneur, Gilbert Eugune Peters, to keep seeking any chance to further your goals, develop yourself, and get ready for a better future. When he was just 19 years old, he launched his first business. Continuous learning is a must, and the industry leaders are a great source to learn from. You must unravel the secrets of Gilbert's success and identify the traits that made him the successful star he is today as part of your Saturday Submission.

You can use the internet for assistance. You must share the submission over a designated EWYL line in your Batch as discussed, and the word count for it must be between 150 and 200 words.
09/08/22, 00:20 - Unknown: For better communication and elaborative discussion, I want to give you my undivided attention in our session.
For that I have decided to keep batch timings:
Since your batch is scheduled on TUESDAY and FRIDAY, I have two slot options for you (the one you choose  will be valid for both days)
*SLOT 1*-11:30 AM-01:00 PM (Zimbabwean Time)
or

This will be valid from TUESDAY (09\/08\/2022) onwards in all our coming sessions.

How are you?
10/10/22, 23:26 - Unknown: As you know that the IndianDoc project has been going on for a while now (for around 20-30 days). We would like to appreciate your efforts and input in this project, however, it did not pan out how we originally wanted. Because your target was 25 forms for $10 and you managed to get 4 forms. We have been very patient for you to perform as Ms. Sanjana, our Project Head and I believed in your intent and competency, but it is not fair to us as a team and to you as a student to redundantly focus on a process that is not output driven. 
Hence, we would like to continue with our sessions, as usual, and participate well in them this surely comes as big learning that from next time we avail the best out of such opportunities. You should always know that after a lot of consideration and discussion I vouched for you despite I received this outcome from you.
Please let me know if you have anything to say about it.

12/10/22, 02:21 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

How are you today?
13/10/22, 05:30 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian!
Hope you are doing well.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real-life example. That is how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because in the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.
Responses will be submitted on the EWYL Line only.

Happy Learning.
