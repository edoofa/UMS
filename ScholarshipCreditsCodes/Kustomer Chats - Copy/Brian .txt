30/05/23, 11:36 - Aditi Kapoor: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
