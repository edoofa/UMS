11/12/23, 15:40 - Saloni Rastogi: May we begin with the session?
11/12/23, 15:50 - Praise EWYL23E0174: Yes please
11/12/23, 15:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Praise, you did not receive the Saturday activity of last week because you did not follow the daily ritual from 8th December to 10th December. Can you share the challenges with me?
11/12/23, 15:59 - Praise EWYL23E0174: The network was down the whole of last week so I couldn't reach out to the EWYL sessions
11/12/23, 16:06 - Saloni Rastogi: I can understand that but did you try to use hotspot of connect from someone else's device?
11/12/23, 16:09 - Praise EWYL23E0174: I'm usually alone at home during the day my parents will be at work
11/12/23, 16:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Okay, no worries Praise!
11/12/23, 16:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's streamline our approach for maximum impact on the projects! Here are your options:
Option 1: *Community-Building Project*
Share 5 forms per week 📋
Cultivate a thriving community 🌱
Encourage connections and contributions 💪

Option 2: *African School Reform Mission Project*
Share 1 school form per week 📚
Transform education in Africa 🌟
Empower the next generation 🎓
Which path aligns best with our mission? 🌍 Let's make a choice and create change! 🚀
11/12/23, 16:16 - Praise EWYL23E0174: Option 2
11/12/23, 16:27 - Saloni Rastogi: That is alright, can you share how will you be working on it?
11/12/23, 16:32 - Praise EWYL23E0174: I will be connecting with local schools in my region and asking the decision makers to collaborate with Edoofa
11/12/23, 16:47 - Saloni Rastogi: There are two ways to work on the African School Reform project:
11/12/23, 16:47 - Saloni Rastogi: A. *Connecting with school virtually*-

▪️ In this you would have to find the contacts of the schools through your peers, friends, neighbors, cousins, school teachers, and school heads.
▪️Then introduce yourself to them professionally and state the purpose of connecting with them along with their available time.
▪️ Then share information about Edoofa that I will be providing you in order to help them understand the Program deeply and with more clarity.
▪️ Then share the school form with them, and if they are interested in connecting with us, then our aim should be to get the form filled.
11/12/23, 16:48 - Saloni Rastogi: B. *Visiting schools physically*


▪️ Now by this, as it clearly says, you have to visit schools nearby and inform them about Edoofa.
▪️ Visiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
▪️ With this, you will surely gain a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, overcome the fear of presenting yourself and your family Edoofa, spontaneously in front of anyone at any point.

13/12/23, 15:49 - Saloni Rastogi: *Happy Wednesday*🌻

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
