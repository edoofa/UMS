Welcome to today's session! Let's kickstart with this motivating quote: 'Believe you can, and you're halfway there.' - Theodore Roosevelt. It's a reminder that mindset matters; belief propels us forward. As we dive in, let's harness the power of belief to drive our success today.
22/01/24, 14:03 - Silibele EWYL23E1031: Thank you yes let's get started
22/01/24, 14:29 - Unknown: Silibele, to begin with. 
What has been the progress on the community Building project that we have finished discussing recently?
22/01/24, 14:35 - Silibele EWYL23E1031: Okay l am getting touch with my fellow mates telling them about the Edoofa scholarship program and they said they will give me response once they talk with their parents
22/01/24, 14:41 - Unknown: Okay great Silibele. This is a good beginning. Just go and take a follow up with these students, talk to their parents and solve any concerns if they have any. 

Then, you can ask them to fill the student application form and then you can share the filled student application forms with me.
22/01/24, 14:41 - Unknown: As our session comes to a close, It was amazing talking to you.
Have a wonderful day, and take care!
