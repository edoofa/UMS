"Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life." - Steve Jobs
Steve Jobs' quote emphasizes the preciousness of time and encourages us to live authentically. It reminds us to prioritize our own passions and pursuits rather than conforming to external expectations.
As we start our session, let's reflect on this quote. Now, how are you doing? I'm eager to hear about your thoughts and experiences as we continue our discussion.
28/11/23, 13:02 - Mwaba EWYL23E0689: Well, am doing fine there's not really much on my mind. How about you
28/11/23, 13:09 - Unknown: I am also absolutely alright, thank you so much for asking.
28/11/23, 13:09 - Mwaba EWYL23E0689: You are welcome
28/11/23, 13:12 - Unknown: Fantastic! Let's make this session a productive one. To begin, the three projects we've been discussing, particularly the

Community Building and African School Reforms initiatives.
28/11/23, 13:12 - Unknown: Could you provide an  update on the Community Building project? What progress have you made?


How many community-building forms have you successfully completed, and what is the typical number of students you have engaged with on average?
28/11/23, 13:22 - Mwaba EWYL23E0689: So far the students available cannot really afford the price required because most of them come from government schools were education is free for all and pay a minimum cost but I am trying by all means to contact other students as well who have just finished school. I want to target students from schools that pay above $100. However, I will not be discouraged I will try by all means to achieve this project
28/11/23, 13:32 - Unknown: Your dedication to promoting the Edoofa Scholarship Program is commendable. I understand the financial constraints some students face, especially in government schools.
Consider targeting recent graduates from schools with higher fees, as they may be more open to opportunities for further education.
Emphasize the long-term benefits of the scholarship, focusing on career growth and personal development. Share success stories to inspire confidence.
Persistence is key. Don't be discouraged; your efforts will make a meaningful impact. If you need guidance, I'm here to help.
28/11/23, 13:32 - Unknown: Have you encountered any challenges that require my attention? I'm curious to hear your perspective on the project's current status.
28/11/23, 13:35 - Mwaba EWYL23E0689: Not really, it's still something I can handle.
28/11/23, 13:40 - Unknown: Alright great, Mwaba. Do let me know if there is anything you feel you are unable to manage.
28/11/23, 13:42 - Mwaba EWYL23E0689: Alright I will tell you whenever I face challenges
28/11/23, 13:44 - Unknown: Now that you have submitted the student application forms/ sooner or later be submitting  them for the Community Building Project  -


Please  make sure the students are completely aware of what Edoofa is and what it does and even the admission stages.
28/11/23, 13:45 - Unknown: If the student goes to the admission counselor and denies that his/her friend did not discuss anything about Edoofa then *you will not earn any scholarship credits*.
28/11/23, 13:50 - Mwaba EWYL23E0689: Am sorry for asking again. can you please share with me what information I should give once I approach a student who is willing to join EDOOFA
28/11/23, 14:04 - Unknown: Sure Mwaba. The Information has also been discussed with you when we discussed project two. Let me reshare the information with you once again.
28/11/23, 14:07 - Unknown: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-

1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
28/11/23, 14:07 - Unknown: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
Here is the message -
28/11/23, 14:07 - Unknown: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe.

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5â€™S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!
28/11/23, 14:08 - Unknown: You can also share these posters with the interested students.

28/11/23, 14:25 - Unknown: Have you encountered any other challenges that require my attention? I'm curious to hear your perspective on the project's current status.
28/11/23, 14:27 - Mwaba EWYL23E0689: Another question. Once the students aquire knowledge about EDOOFA and fill in the form you sent earlier what comes next
28/11/23, 14:30 - Unknown: Then, you have to send the filled form to me.
28/11/23, 14:31 - Unknown: Here are a few things you need to keep in mind before submitting the form.

"Your present circumstances don't determine where you can go; they merely determine where you start." - Nido Qubein

01/12/23, 13:28 - Mwaba EWYL23E0689: Well, the Wednesday lesson was about the power of analyzing which is an art needed before undertaking any task. This skill is about developing a deeper understanding of the world around us. This skill includes understanding the task at hand, considering the inputs, crafting the process (developing a process or plan) , evaluating the output this allows you to identify areas of strength and weakness. It also includes learning from mistakes analyzing what went wrong. This helps refine your approach in the future. This skill is not only necessary in dealing with assignments and school work it is also useful in the professional world as employer's value individuals with this skill. That was my understanding of the Wednesday lesson
01/12/23, 13:40 - Unknown: The Wednesday lesson response highlighted the crucial skill of analysis, emphasizing its role in understanding tasks, considering inputs, crafting processes, evaluating outputs, and learning from mistakes. This skill extends beyond academics, proving valuable in the professional world where employers highly appreciate individuals with strong analytical abilities. Keep honing these skills for success in various aspects of life.

He said he will get back to me once he is done. So for now I will be waiting for his response then I can create a WhatsApp group and add the students then share information about EDOOFA.
01/12/23, 13:55 - Unknown: That's excellent progress! Your proactive approach in reaching out and establishing contact for the community building project is commendable.

How many students have you interacted with so far?

And what are the exact difficulties or challenges that you are facing while working on the project?
05/12/23, 14:27 - Mwaba EWYL23E0689: Honestly my challenge is the issue of trying to reach out to students who are able to afford and those who have graduated from high school. The thing is most students I know who have recently graduated already know about the EDOOFA program. So the challenge here is reaching out to students who don't know about EDOOFA and are willing to be part of it . Remember when I told you I managed to reach out to someone who said he would share the contact numbers of the students who are interested, he said he will get back to me once he his done but I am still waiting up to now. I still have hope that he will manage
05/12/23, 14:29 - Mwaba EWYL23E0689: In the meantime time I managed to get the phone number of a director of a school here in my town. I attended primary school from there but I left afterwards it continues up to secondary School there's also boarding for secondary
05/12/23, 14:48 - Unknown: Thank you for sharing your challenges and efforts. To address reaching students unaware of EDOOFA:
Explore Different Channels:Investigate alternative communication channels, such as local community forums or online platforms where potential students might be active.

Emphasize the importance of their role in connecting you with interested students.

Follow Up with Contacts:Politely follow up with the person who offered to share contact numbers.
Reiterate the significance of timely communication in supporting interested students.
05/12/23, 14:49 - Unknown: Engage with the School Director:Reach out to the school director with a clear, concise message about EDOOFA.
Highlight the benefits and encourage them to share information with their students.

Stay persistent, and your efforts will contribute to the success of the project. If you need further assistance or guidance, feel free to discuss.

08/12/23, 13:05 - Unknown: Good morning, Mwaba

As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"

Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."
08/12/23, 13:10 - Unknown: Now, the riddle's answer is an echo. Just like an echo, our actions reverberate in the world, shaping the narrative of our lives. Steve Jobs' quote underscores the importance of finding passion and purpose in our endeavors. It's not just about going through the motions; it's about doing work that resonates with your inner self.

For you, remarkable young students, this is the time to explore, to discover what makes your heartbeat faster. Your journey is not just about grades and achievements; it's about finding the echoes of your passion and letting them guide you toward a future filled with great work.

So, let's dive into today's session with enthusiasm and curiosity, ready to uncover the echoes that will shape your extraordinary journey.

08/12/23, 13:41 - Mwaba EWYL23E0689: Yes
08/12/23, 14:01 - Unknown: great.
08/12/23, 14:02 - Unknown: Now, onto your projects, starting with the Community Building Project. Can you walk me through the steps you've taken to build a community and spread the word about Edoofa opportunities? Any interesting stories or challenges you've encountered along the way?
08/12/23, 14:05 - Mwaba EWYL23E0689: Firstly I would like to ask a question is it ok to give an application form to someone who's going to be in Grade 12 next year
08/12/23, 14:19 - Unknown: Yes, sure. You can definitely do that.
08/12/23, 14:19 - Unknown: Speaking of challenges, have there been any unexpected hurdles in the Community Building Project? And, importantly, how are you tackling them? Understanding these roadblocks helps us refine our strategy.
08/12/23, 14:24 - Mwaba EWYL23E0689: There hasn't been any challenges just following the tips you have me
08/12/23, 14:25 - Mwaba EWYL23E0689: I am very curious to ask but is there a due date for all our projects or?
