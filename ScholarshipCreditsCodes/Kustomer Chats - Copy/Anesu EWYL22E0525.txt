It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

03/11/22, 23:28 - Unknown: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.
03/11/22, 23:28 - Unknown: May I please know your EWYL Group name and mentor name?
04/11/22, 00:31 - Anesu EWYL22E0525: Greetings to you as well.
I am well.
04/11/22, 00:32 - Anesu EWYL22E0525: My EWYL group name is Anesu EWYL22E0525 and my mentor is Riva Singh.
07/11/22, 18:53 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian.

The message that we want to be our daily habit, our words of connecting and experiencing a sense of belonging, We all at team Edoofa are very thrilled as we personally are undertaking the same activity. May I know what have you understood from this message, what is the intention behind the same?
09/11/22, 19:51 - Anesu EWYL22E0525: I have understood that the mantle of Edoofian is not one to take lightly as it brings on the responsibility and privilege of being part of a community oriented toward bringing about change and making a difference, as such it should be a daily mantra of sorts as a way of reminding this notion thus ensuring that I don't drop the ball on this wonderful opportunity. My intent as a proud Edoofian is to adopt this practise everyday during our interaction times.

I hope that you will be performing this ritual everyday on the *EWYL DEDICATED LINE* at 9 AM With help of the above text, can you define who an Edoofian is?
09/11/22, 22:53 - Anesu EWYL22E0525: An Edoofian is a strong willed and disciplined individual who is driven to make a difference big or small. An Edoofian is a made leader one whose actions speak on their behalf
09/11/22, 22:54 - Unknown: That is great so daily texting me in the morning saying- I am a proud Edoofian should charge you up and fill you with Pride. Let us make it our daily ritual!

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.
 
I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.
 
Happy Learning.

I would like to share a brief message about the importance of planning in our lives and as an organization as well!


Planning is definitely significant as it directs us where to go, it furnishes direction and decreases the danger of risk by making predictions. The significant advantages of planning are provided below:
Planning provides directions: Planning assures that the objectives are certainly asserted so that they serve as a model for determining what action should be taken and in which direction. If objects are well established, employees are informed of what the company has to do and what they need do to accomplish those purposes.
Planning decreases the chances of risk: Planning is an activity which permits a manager to look forward and predict changes. By determining in prior the tasks to be completed, planning notes the way to deal with changes and unpredictable effects.
Planning decreases overlapping and wasteful activities: Planning works as the foundation of organising the activities and purposes of distinct branches, departments, and people. It assists in avoiding chaos and confusion. Since planning guarantees precision in understanding and action, work is conducted on easily without delays.
Planning encourages innovative ideas: Since it is the primary function of management, new approaches can take the form of actual plans. It is the most challenging project for the management as it leads all planned actions pointing to growth and of the business.
Planning aids decision making: It encourages the manager to look into the future and make a decision from amongst several alternative plans of action. The manager has to assess each option and pick the most viable plan.
19/11/22, 19:17 - Unknown: Okay, are you done with it?
19/11/22, 19:47 - Anesu EWYL22E0525: Yes ma'am I am done
19/11/22, 20:50 - Unknown: okay good
19/11/22, 20:50 - Unknown: Now, please let me know what did you understand from the above text and how should we execute the same?
Which EWYL project are you currently working on and how will you use planning function  in that?
12/01/23, 19:37 - Anesu EWYL22E0525: Good afternoon ma'am

It has been a while since we have connected,
The holiday season is finally over and we are back to the curriculum.

13/01/23, 03:04 - Unknown: How was your new years experience?
13/01/23, 03:15 - Anesu EWYL22E0525: The new year's was okay, how was yours
13/01/23, 20:37 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
This is to inform you that  today  we celebrate a very prestigious festival in my religion: *Lohri*

The end of the winter season is a joyous one in India, with Lohri celebrated on January 13 annually. This is a special celebration, particularly in Northern India, that marks the harvest of the winter rabi crops and the end of the winter solstice. It celebrates the sun and the ushering in of longer days.
Do research about this festival and let me know whatever insight you gain.

 The ability to solve problems is a basic life skill and is essential to our day-to-day lives, at home, at school, and at work. We solve problems every day without really thinking about how we solve them. For example: it’s raining and you need to go to the store. What do you do? There are lots of possible solutions. Take your umbrella and walk. If you don't want to get wet, you can drive, or take the bus. There is no right way to solve this problem and different people will solve it differently. However in our Wednesday wisdom we learnt about some Problem solving strategies. As part of your Saturday activity, I want you to share with us a problem that you encountered very recently and how did you Solve It. Did you use any strategy that was similar to what Munger has talked about?

Looking forward to your responses!


We will continue the discussion we left on Monday! 
Do not forget to send *I am a proud edoofian* even on Sunday!!

I will forward this form. 

Do share your results with me on Monday, if they’re out.
16/01/23, 23:49 - Anesu EWYL22E0525: Good evening
17/01/23, 00:05 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian,
Excuse me for a delayed reply, I was unavailable due to the weekend.
I hope you had a great weekend!
It is time for your session.
17/01/23, 00:53 - Anesu EWYL22E0525: Ok sure no problem ma'am.
17/01/23, 00:53 - Anesu EWYL22E0525: Yes I believe it is
17/01/23, 19:26 - Unknown: Hello my lovely edoofians, hope you are doing well.

I have some amazing news and an opportunity to share with you. But first, do you know, A 2018 report by WaterAid India and Menstrual Hygiene Alliance India (MHAI) states that there are 336 million menstruating women in India, out of which only 121 million use sanitary pads. Assuming that these women use eight sanitary pads for one cycle (conservatively), a simple calculation reveals that almost one billion sanitary pads are used and disposed of every year.  The primary component in all disposable sanitary napkins is plastic. This takes approximately 500-800 years to fully disintegrate after disposal. Assuming one billion DSNs are disposed of every year, handling menstrual waste becomes a mammoth task.

And the solution to this problem is Sustainable menstruation!

Wondering what it is :

* Sustainable menstruation refers to the use of alternative products during one’s menstrual cycle for the benefit of the body and the earth.
* Sustainable menstruation is being mindful of the negative effects disposable sanitary products have on our environment in an effort to reduce the plastic waste ending up in our oceans or landfills.

I would like to invite you to our webinar on Sustainable menstruation tomorrow I.e. 18th January 2023, wherein we will be joined by Dr.Aarushi Kehar Malhotra. She will be helping us understand it better and how can each one of us be the solution to this problem.

Don’t forget to join by 5:45 PM IST, the webinar will start exactly at 6:00 PM [2:30 PM: Zimbabwean time] . Don’t be late for this webinar. Come prepared with the questions that you might have!

I hope you are doing well!

Let us start our day with a quote: “Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.”
10/02/23, 02:09 - Anesu EWYL22E0525: Thanks for sharing the powerful quote
10/02/23, 17:05 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian,
I hope you are doing well!

Let us start our day with a quote: What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.” — Henry David Thoreau

The inner sense of captaincy is a vital component of leadership that gives individuals the confidence and determination to make a positive impact. It involves having a deep understanding of oneself, embracing weaknesses, and having a positive growth-oriented mindset. Developing an inner sense of captaincy can help individuals navigate challenges, inspire and motivate others, and tap into their full potential as leaders. In today’s Wednesday wisdom, we will explore the importance of this aspect of leadership. 

We will discuss your key learnings in our today’s session!
