19/07/22, 19:44 - Unknown: Hello Unity! How are you doing?
19/07/22, 19:44 - Unknown: How are your exams going on?
19/07/22, 20:28 - Unity EWYL21E0194: I'm doing good and you?
19/07/22, 20:28 - Unity EWYL21E0194: I finished my exams last week.
19/07/22, 21:40 - Unknown: That is good Unity, how were the exams?
19/07/22, 21:51 - Unity EWYL21E0194: They were good
19/07/22, 22:14 - Unknown: That is amazing Unity.
19/07/22, 22:15 - Unknown: Now I believe it is time to get back on the projects as well, right?
19/07/22, 22:35 - Unity EWYL21E0194: Yes
19/07/22, 23:12 - Unknown: Great unity.
19/07/22, 23:12 - Unknown: So, how do you plan to resume work?
19/07/22, 23:47 - Unity EWYL21E0194: I'm still planning, but soon will start.
19/07/22, 23:54 - Unknown: I see unity. Are you facing challenges with the planning?
19/07/22, 23:57 - Unity EWYL21E0194: No sir
20/07/22, 01:12 - Unknown: Good unity, Do not worry, I am anyway here to help you with the same. Let me also share with you this week's Weekend activity to work on.
20/07/22, 01:12 - Unknown: Its that time of the week, when you are required to wear your thinking caps and get your tools ready to research and learn! From our Wednesday Wisdom, we learnt how Patrice Motsepe, became successful by making the best of the opportunity very few could see, the strong potential in the mining industry. As part of your Saturday Activity you are required to share a detailed submission on the fast growing industry\/sector\/business in your country. Don’t forget to add a SWOT analysis and the predictions on the future performance of the same.

Word limit- 250-500 words. \u2028Use of internet is allowed but do not copy the entire submission from internet. You have to write it in your own words.
20/07/22, 03:23 - Unity EWYL21E0194: Okay
20/07/22, 20:44 - Unknown: Hello Unity! How are you? 

Please send the \"proud Edoofian\" message for the day.
20/07/22, 22:39 - Unity EWYL21E0194: I'm doing good and you?
20/07/22, 22:39 - Unity EWYL21E0194: Okay
20/07/22, 23:10 - Unity EWYL21E0194: I'm a proud edoofian
20/07/22, 23:11 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
21/07/22, 01:40 - Unknown: Great unity!
21/07/22, 01:41 - Unknown: NowDo work on the Wednesday wisdom that I have shared today and share the response here tomorrow.
21/07/22, 03:09 - Unity EWYL21E0194: Okay
21/07/22, 17:40 - Unity EWYL21E0194: Key takeaways:

If you want to become successful and want to achieve something, don't blame the world if you fail to achieve what you want .You must accept personal responsibility and you must learn from your mistakes. In a game of success, there is a lose and a win. If you fail to achieve what you want now then never give up, keep on trying. Only time matters!

If you want to achieve something in life, you must get to work hard. Things don't happen magically, so you have to make things happen. You must stay focused and always be positive.
21/07/22, 20:24 - Unknown: \"Challenges are what make life interesting. Overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.”  Marine

Greeting of the day, my proud Edoofian! How are you doing?
21/07/22, 20:25 - Unknown: Good to read your response on this lesson Unity! I am glad that you were able to understand the crux of that which is that successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it

25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

26/07/22, 22:46 - Unknown: \"The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members.\" – Coretta Scott King


Hello my proud Edoofian! Greetings of the day. How are you?
26/07/22, 22:46 - Unknown: Good work on the project unity, keep it up!
26/07/22, 22:46 - Unknown: Did you work on the very interesting Weekend Activity?

This week we discussed about the growth mindset of successful people and how you will ensure that you develop the same for you.
26/07/22, 23:04 - Unity EWYL21E0194: Qn. The growth mindset of successful people and how will you make sure you develop the same mindset? 

People with growth mindsets believe that skill and intelligence are something that people can develop. They believe that while people have inherent qualities and traits, success comes from constant personal development.

Below are some of the points that will help you develop the growth mindset. 

*Find examples of others who have developed a growth mindset*

Start talking to your friends, family, and colleagues about the growth mindset. See if anyone you know has also been working on developing one. They might be able to provide some valuable insights.

*Change your perspective on failure*

Start viewing failure not as a sign of inability but as part of the process of learning.

Nobody starts out on any endeavor being the perfect example of the goal. Even the world’s greatest athletes, artists, and business magnates started out as kids with little talent or expertise.

*Understand your own limitations*

Recognize that some things will be beyond what you can achieve. This helps you to set realistic goals. It will help you understand that some endeavors will require even more effort.

*See your challenges as opportunities*

Life will always find a way to throw something difficult at you. Try not to see these challenges as obstacles or setbacks that you dread. 

Rather, try to view them more positively. Try to view them as opportunities to overcome something difficult and grow as a result. The more difficult the challenge, the greater the opportunity for learning and growth.

*Reflect each day on what you’ve failed at (and learned from)*

Many of us spend some time at the end of the day reflecting on our successes. While this is a valuable habit, try adding a couple of minutes to reflect on the areas where things didn’t go as well. What did you learn from that experience? The point isn't to dwell or beat yourself up but to
27/07/22, 00:55 - Unknown: Amazing to read your activity response, i am proud to see that you are able to understand complex concepts now. How do you plan to implement in your day to day life?
27/07/22, 01:18 - Unity EWYL21E0194: Sometimes I am used to working under tight schedule, so I set my most urgent tasks at the top of my to do list every morning when I wake up.
27/07/22, 02:07 - Unity EWYL21E0194: Sir, I also wanted to know my scholarship credits now, after deducting the amount that was deposited to the school account
27/07/22, 02:07 - Unity EWYL21E0194: ?
27/07/22, 19:26 - Unknown: hello unity

28/07/22, 00:51 - Unity EWYL21E0194: And as per the EWYL document, If a student manages to pay the Edoofa enrollment fee, I will get a reward of $20 per student, and if a student manages to complete the admission fee (registration fee), again I will get a reward of $30 per student.
