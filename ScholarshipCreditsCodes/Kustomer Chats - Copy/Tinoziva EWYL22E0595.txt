20/01/23, 00:31 - Tinoziva EWYL22E0595: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Tinoziva and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Tinoziva22E0595
20/01/23, 16:44 - Unknown: Greetings Tinoziva!
How are you?
20/01/23, 16:44 - Unknown: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
20/01/23, 16:45 - Unknown: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
20/01/23, 16:46 - Unknown: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *03:00-06:00 PM.*
