18/07/22, 07:19 - Saint EWYL21E0693: In my research i have noticed that most successful upcoming business now are on agriculture sector. For example Zimbabwe is one of the countries in the world with richest soil, plenty of land and favorable climate conditions  good for farming. Indeed it is expensive especially when starting but one can enjoy profits easily. Especially growing legumes like ground nuts, beans and other crops like wheat. The market of such crops is readily available in the world but sometimes affected by Chain of demand. Apart from that for such organization to be successful it requires to be done in large scale thus requires more labor and capital intensive hence more expensive to startup. In this sector it is easy to acquire loans and financial help as government is ready to help such organization. It also  requires expertise in such industry to manage and come up with good harvest which are very few and expensive to hire. Due to rapid climate change in the world  such industry will be affected for example cyclones. Especially in Zimbabwe the government is giving free education on farming and also supplying inputs to such organisation's for free thus reducing expenses of business.

21/07/22, 21:44 - Saint EWYL21E0693: From the lesson i managed to take some key points such as : don't  blame others for your failures in life, just accept your responsibility for us to be successful in life.
. For us to be successful in our lives we have to work.
From the story of sea and sailor, I have learned that blaming does not solve anything but hurt others, so think before hurt anyone. Apart from that, I have learned that to be successful in life you have to accept your responsibility and face reality.

25/07/22, 15:39 - Saint EWYL21E0693: As you told me earlier that, positive mindset, confidence and critical thinking is the route to success. Most successful people they have hope and patience in their mind, because it takes very  long for someone to be successful and also it takes ups and downs (hardships) for us to be successful. Successful one's keep on going nomatter how many times the fall whilst failure can not endure pain they just let it go. As for me I will make sure that I utilize this opportunity by having guidance from you my mentors and your teachings, as most successful people are good listeners. Through sharing some ideas that can guide and sharpen my brain I will be successful one day. For us to be successful one should learn  to accept and to be responsible other than play blame game. Most successful people have bright mind as they find problems in the community and try the best way to solve the problem thus being helpful. The other thing is if you want to be successful don't rush take step by step and also you should find field that you are comfortable in not doing something that won't makes you feel home.
25/07/22, 15:50 - Saint EWYL21E0693: Q1. Through doing projects and task from my mentors. My community will benefit as deserving students will get a chance to explore the world. And through projects like community building my community will benefit a lot.
Q2.  Through our greetings that shows sense of solidarity, through sharing our on view and ideas to the edoofa community and creating whatsapp groups that can accommodate every edoofian.

Apart from that, your companionship will decide your future so the most important take away is making wise choose when choosing your friends.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off

Hope you are doing well. This week we learned about one of the most popular yet grounded people who used social media as a tool to become an educator and give back to the community and still become an entrepreneur.
This week I want you to reflect on what your strengths and skills are to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 

These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content etc.
Please share these skills and instances where you were able to showcase these skills in your next session.
Till then
