26/09/23, 13:18 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.
26/09/23, 13:19 - Lois EWYL23E0579: Noted
26/09/23, 13:20 - Ananya: Now, I believe that we should initiate something that aligns with your interests. So, may I ask which project is your favorite project?
26/09/23, 13:22 - Lois EWYL23E0579: My favorite project amongst the ones l was given ??
26/09/23, 13:22 - Ananya: Yes!
26/09/23, 13:31 - Lois EWYL23E0579: Okayy ...my favorite was the project about community building
26/09/23, 13:33 - Ananya: That's amazing! So may I ask what is your progress in that? Do you have any idea for working on this project?
26/09/23, 13:35 - Lois EWYL23E0579: Yes...l had started working on it...l created a group..with A level students and told them about Edoofa and many of them were interested and they filled the application form
26/09/23, 13:38 - Ananya: Great! Did you share the form with me?
26/09/23, 13:38 - Lois EWYL23E0579: Yes in the group
26/09/23, 13:39 - Ananya: No dear, you have to share those with me on your EWYL group,

26/09/23, 13:42 - Ananya: Now to stay on this progressive track, you should keep your community engaging! And do you know how can you do that?
26/09/23, 13:43 - Lois EWYL23E0579: Not really
26/09/23, 13:43 - Ananya: So for community building:
1) Keep the group updated DAILY.
2) Try reaching out to students from different schools
3) Try reaching out to teachers from your school or others and ask them to share the link to your WhatsApp group with other school teachers from different schools
4) In the group just:
-please give 'only admins' access
-just ask the students/participants to DM you to know about Edoofa and to get the form
-once they DM you, share about Edoofa with them
-Before sharing the form, ask them to get you added to their school groups
-once they do that, then only share the form with them.â€‹
26/09/23, 13:44 - Lois EWYL23E0579: Alright... that is clear
26/09/23, 13:45 - Ananya: Now, I have a trick through which you can connect with more students and increase your community! Would you like to hear it?
26/09/23, 13:46 - Lois EWYL23E0579: Yes
26/09/23, 13:47 - Ananya: Another thing you can do is:

Go to Facebook and search for "Student Communities in Zimbabwe"
Join a relevant group from the appeared results.
Share information about Edoofa and include the WhatsApp group link.
Interested individuals can join the group and connect with you.
