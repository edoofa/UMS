It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.

Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.

06/10/23, 16:12 - Ananya: That's amazing! You know to keep the group active you can try the followings:
So for community building:
1) Keep the group updated DAILY.
2) Try reaching out to students from different schools
3) Try reaching out to teachers from your school or others and ask them to share the link to your WhatsApp group with other school teachers from different schools
4) In the group just:
-please give 'only admins' access
-just ask the students/participants to DM you to know about Edoofa and to get the form
-once they DM you, share about Edoofa with them
-Before sharing the form, ask them to get you added to their school groups
-once they do that, then only share the form with them.â€‹
â€‹5) Use social media as your sword to tell people about Edoofa
06/10/23, 16:15 - Silibaziso EWYL23E0522: Wow! Thank you
06/10/23, 16:17 - Ananya: Well, now tell me, how are you connecting with your students? Or how are you increasing your community?
06/10/23, 16:19 - Silibaziso EWYL23E0522: Am about to start,mam .Am sure it will be great since you gave me your super ideas
06/10/23, 16:20 - Ananya: Great, so let me share one more idea with you!

10/10/23, 16:56 - Ananya: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_
