25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

25/08/22, 16:07 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
25/08/22, 16:16 - Kudzaishe EWYL21E0726: First of all I would like to say ,where l come from is my biggest inspiration . Having had grown in a high density suburb ,I faced a lot of problems as a young kid and watched many kids face many kinds of problems too .My main goal is to improve the lives of little kids in my community . Everyday I watched many children go to school bare footed with no food .I watched many teenagers waste their lives doing drugs because their parents couldn't cater for their education .So this had a very big impact on Kudzaishe .I wish to make my community and where l come from a better environment for children .I want to help those who are in need and make their lives better .So whenever I am doing something ,I always ask myself ,is what I'm doing bringing me a step close to where l wanna reach .My strong desire and passion for change always pushes me into working hard and has been moulding me into a better person

25/08/22, 19:31 - Unknown: The Wednesday Wisdom Lesson this week will focus on three business success stories that went from rags to riches. Additionally, social learning is a very effective method of learning. You can learn from the mistakes and accomplishments of others, so you don't have to figure everything out on your own, for instance.

Your mentors will have a thorough discussion in our forthcoming session about what you think were the factors that led to the success of the three panellists listed here after you have carefully listened to the audio file and read the PDF.
Happy learning!
26/08/22, 17:24 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian!
How excited are you for the weekend?
