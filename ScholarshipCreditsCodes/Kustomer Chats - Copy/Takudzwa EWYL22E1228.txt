03/03/23, 00:35 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228: Yes I did and they were interested and signed up for it
03/03/23, 00:36 - Aditi Kapoor: Well done, how's everything there?
03/03/23, 00:36 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228: You mean at school right?
03/03/23, 00:38 - Aditi Kapoor: Yeah how's school? I hope you are free now?
03/03/23, 00:41 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228: Yes was free from 1pm today just had bad network connection but it's great now
03/03/23, 00:42 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228: School is really good and the pressure is manageable
03/03/23, 00:43 - Aditi Kapoor: Alright, I will be visiting a university tomorrow where there are many Edoofians present there and I will share their experiences with you when I come back on Saturday.
03/03/23, 00:44 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228: Okay sir, if you don't mind, what's the name of that university?
03/03/23, 00:44 - Aditi Kapoor: PDM university in Haryana
03/03/23, 00:45 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228: How many Edoofians are in that university and are there ones doing my course field
03/03/23, 00:47 - Aditi Kapoor: Which field exactly?
03/03/23, 00:47 - Aditi Kapoor: Computer science?
03/03/23, 00:48 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228: Yes computer science and\/ IT
03/03/23, 00:48 - Aditi Kapoor: There are some but let me get in contact with them too
03/03/23, 00:49 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228: Okay that would be wonderful
03/03/23, 00:50 - Aditi Kapoor: Do you want to know more about it?
03/03/23, 00:50 - Aditi Kapoor: About the university.
03/03/23, 00:51 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228: Yes I would love to
03/03/23, 00:52 - Aditi Kapoor: So currently I am mentoring over 8 students there
03/03/23, 00:52 - Aditi Kapoor: They are all from Zimbabwe and they will be sharing their experiences
03/03/23, 00:55 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228: Wow that's very good so how are they coping with everything there. Any common challenges or interests they share
03/03/23, 01:00 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes you see there is a common confusion that comes everytime rearding the EWYL
03/03/23, 01:01 - Aditi Kapoor: So basically the EWYL Program helps you pay off the fees by earning scholarship credits
03/03/23, 01:02 - Aditi Kapoor: But most of the times students don't perform well in the projects and by the time the exams are coming, they will not be able to pay the fees which will ultimately result in blocked attendance and they are not allowed to sit for the exams
03/03/23, 01:04 - Aditi Kapoor: So the earning part of the EWYL is sometimes considered as a free scholarship which is not, in fact without putting in any efforts, you will not be awarded for free in anything
03/03/23, 01:05 - Aditi Kapoor: Can you understand what I am trying to say?
03/03/23, 01:06 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228: Yes I understand that, so if you don't mind me asking how much credits have I earned from those candidates on application forms
03/03/23, 01:07 - Aditi Kapoor: So there is a revision on the community building project
03/03/23, 01:07 - Aditi Kapoor: for every 25 students who undergoes the counselling process, you will be awarded $10
03/03/23, 01:08 - Aditi Kapoor: Moreover if you can get students from South Africa, you will be awarded $25 per enrollment and this is exclusive only for you
03/03/23, 01:08 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228: From the ones I previously sent how many have went through counseling
03/03/23, 01:09 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228: Yes there are two students I got but exclusively one of them was interested
03/03/23, 01:10 - Aditi Kapoor: It usually takes a week or 10 days to reach out to the students so allow me some time to check up
03/03/23, 01:11 - Aditi Kapoor: Well you see out of the two of them again, if he enrolls then only you will get the credits so it is important that they enroll too as you told me they are interested but if they don't enroll then that is a false impression right?
03/03/23, 01:12 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228: Okay understood I'll keep getting students, companies and schools
03/03/23, 01:12 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228: Yes I understood that when you gave me the forms
04/03/23, 01:34 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228: I am a proud Edoofian

06/03/23, 16:54 - Aditi Kapoor: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”
06/03/23, 17:07 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228: 1. The key factors that contributed to NetFlorist company success are customer-centricity, hard work and power of innovation. The Bacher brothers started of with a  small flower delivery business where it further utilize the opportunity internet platforms gave them to enable them to do online shopping and become more recognized. The company's focus and dedication on innovation and technology enabled their company to grow and being the first e-commerce company in South Africa. Their focus in invested on a user-friendly and efficient delivery system made NetFlorist develop a customer-centric platform that lead to their success. By using an online platform, NetFlorist took advantage of digital marketing, leveraging social media and mailing to enable growth and development in their business. This vision and dedication has allowed them to grow their business to be well known in the entire country (South Africa).

2. Firstly is persistency, innovation, passion and determination. Persistency and\/perseverance will enable me to complete something I have started whether big or small, by breaking long-term goals into small achievable ones. Innovation will enable me to be open minded, think outside the box and be creative. Passion and determination creates that hunger to achieve what I started and build that interest or love in doing it
