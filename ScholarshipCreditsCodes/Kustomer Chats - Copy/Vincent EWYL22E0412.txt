21/07/22, 00:07 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Vincent Marezva and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Vincent EWYL22E0412
21/07/22, 18:02 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: I am a proud EDOOFIAN
21/07/22, 18:04 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

21/07/22, 18:09 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: Thank you. I’m delighted to be part of such a big family or purposeful students and dedicated mentors?
21/07/22, 23:28 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Vincent Marezva and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Vincent EWYL22E0412
22/07/22, 00:05 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: Hello Ms Saloni
22/07/22, 00:08 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Vincent!
How's your day going?
22/07/22, 00:09 - Unknown: I am so happy and glad to welcome you to the EWYL Line. I hope you are equally excited and enthusiastic.
22/07/22, 00:10 - Unknown: Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our *WEDNESDAY Wisdom* was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
22/07/22, 00:10 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: It going on well. Thank you. How is yours?
22/07/22, 00:11 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: Ohky ma’am
22/07/22, 00:17 - Unknown: I am also doing great, thanks for asking.
22/07/22, 00:26 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: When we always point something or someone as the reason for our failure, we eventually lose energy to continue trying. This might convince us that failure is bound to befall us without escape and we consequently lose trust in ourselves and begin to undermine our capabilities. Taking full responsibility of our mistakes is the beginning of success.  When we accept our mistakes, we make an effort to correct them. We should not be disheartened when we exert an effort and still do not get desirable outcome for it takes persistence and continuous hardwork for us to be successful. 

That’s my understanding Ms Saloni
22/07/22, 00:36 - Unknown: I read your response Vincent and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
22/07/22, 00:37 - Unknown: Now we are left with our discussion on the projects.
22/07/22, 00:39 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: Thank you
22/07/22, 00:39 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: Ohky ma’am.
22/07/22, 00:42 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: With regards to the projects. Do I need to be doing them in the order in which they were given or it is flexible as to which one I give precedence
22/07/22, 04:17 - Unknown: Vincent you can share your response on the projects in any order, we can start with the community building project.
What I think to work on them is by setting a daily target of 2 forms\/ per day. In this way, you will regularly work on them and keep on earning scholarship credits. What do you think?
22/07/22, 04:17 - Unknown: I see Vincent you have typed 3, may I know what challenges you are facing?
22/07/22, 04:18 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group.
22/07/22, 04:19 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
22/07/22, 04:19 - Unknown: I hope now you have clarity on what and who a proud edoofian is.
22/07/22, 04:20 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: I think that will be a good approach
22/07/22, 04:22 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: That’s a well detailed explanation. Thank you
22/07/22, 04:23 - Unknown: That's the spirit, Vincent, I am glad that I could be of any help to you.
22/07/22, 04:24 - Unknown: We were on the community building project, so tell me your take on it.
22/07/22, 04:26 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: Ma’am the projects targets students who already graduated from their A level studies or is open to those who are still studying
22/07/22, 04:28 - Unknown: You can approach students who are in their O-level as well as students in their A-level.
22/07/22, 04:34 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: Ohky ma’am
22/07/22, 04:50 - Unknown: So starting from tomorrow I want you to bring 2 forms filled each day.
22/07/22, 04:50 - Unknown: Let me share the form with you for quick reference.

25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

25/07/22, 19:32 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: *Assignment: The growth mentality of successful people. *
_Due date : 25\/07\/22_

A growth mindset is based on the idea that your essential qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. It sees these qualities not as fixed abilities but rather these abilities can develop under good teaching and persistence. Most successful people have an optimistic growth-oriented mindset that they are malleable and can learn through both experience and effort.

Fostering a growth mentality involves viewing failure not as a negative but rather as a positive and evidence of a need for change. People with a growth mindset actively seek learning opportunities which result in more career success. They are curious about everything and more importantly their personal growth and self improvement. 

Successful people always seek out challenge. Challenges are opportunities that propel you forward towards your goals and help you grow. They believe if one becomes too comfortable in his current career, it might be an indication that its time to seek out new challenges. Also, people who want to grow personally and professionally tend to ask for and value feedback. They are not afraid of being judged or criticized. 

Personally, I will make sure I develop the same mentality by;
1. seeking out new challenges,
2. embracing my own mistakes and failures,
3. valuing feedback,
4. becoming a lifelong learner and
5. going beyond my limits.

26/07/22, 18:26 - Unknown: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

Yesterday I had an amazing day. I went to the airport to receive all my proud Edoofians and I had tears in my eyes seeing their happiness and enthusiasm. I want you to look at it and share your thoughts with me.
26/07/22, 18:31 - Unknown: I read your understanding of the activity and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it’s not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you’re looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don’t do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.

How's your day going?
29/07/22, 00:59 - Unknown: Time management is defined as using your time productively and efficiently—but what about when you are working as productively as possible, and you still can’t get everything done? It may be better to think about time management as a combination of working productively and prioritizing your time.

Our *Wednesday Wisdom* was all about Time Management and understanding the priority matrix to organize our tasks. 
I am really excited to hear your understanding and working on the same.
Please share it with me here.
In today's session we will talk about:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. progress on community building projects.
29/07/22, 15:48 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: I understood that prioritizing one has to give priority to task which are important rather than those he might consider urgent. One cannot afford missing an important task but some urgent task which are not important can be missed. From the matrix, urgent but very important task are to be completed first followed by very important but low urgent ones. Tasks which are lowly important and are of low urgency may not be done.
29/07/22, 15:52 - Vincent EWYL22E0412: Regarding the project, I’m waiting for feedback from people whom I contacted and said they would want to consult their parents regarding the same.

30/07/22, 02:42 - Unknown: Good evening Vincent!
How's your day going?
30/07/22, 02:45 - Unknown: Your response to the Wednesday wisdom has made me realize our childhood quote  is Money'.
Through Wednesday Wisdom, my main aim was to educate my Edoofians about TIME MANAGEMENT and HOW IT CAN BE ACHIEVED.
You know are very well aware of what Time management means, let me tell you about what Time Management includes:

#Effective Planning
# Setting goals and objectives
# Setting deadlines
# Delegation of responsibilities
# Prioritizing activities as per their importance
# Spending the right time on the right activity

The benefits of Time Management are:
- Time Management makes an individual punctual and disciplined.
- One becomes more organized as a result of effective Time Management.
- Individuals who stick to a time plan are the ones who realize their goals and objectives within the shortest possible period. 
- Research says that individuals who accomplish tasks on time are less prone to stress and anxiety. 

How can we achieve it:
# Set a goal for yourself.
# Priority matrix (like we talked about in the Wednesday lesson)
# Organize your study space
# Do a SWOT Analysis of yourself.

I am sure you will note all these things and imply in your day-to-day life and do share with me what changes you have felt.
