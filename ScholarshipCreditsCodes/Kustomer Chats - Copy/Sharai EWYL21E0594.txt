20/01/23, 20:11 - Sharai EWYL21E0594: From now on, We will be having our regular sessions on the *EWYL DEDICATED LINE*
I will only be using this group in case you miss out on the Proud Edoofian Ritual, okay?
20/01/23, 20:13 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

21/01/23, 00:16 - Sharai EWYL21E0594: who is my mentor
21/01/23, 21:53 - Unknown: Greetings Sharai!
How are you?
21/01/23, 21:56 - Unknown: I am Ms. Saloni, a mentor at Edoofa.
Your mentor is Mr. Rithvik Rana and recently, he is not doing well with his health. This is the reason for the delay in reaching out to you, but I am here to cover up for the time and share with you some exciting information on the weekend activity and webinar that is happening on Monday. Have a look and in case you have any concerns, feel free to reach out to me here.
21/01/23, 21:56 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

A college student named Rachel was unsure of what career path to pursue after graduation. She talked to several professionals in different fields, but none of them seemed to fit her interests and skills. One day, she had a conversation with a mentor who asked her the right questions, such as \"What are you passionate about?\" and \"What do you enjoy doing in your free time?\" Rachel realized that her true passion was writing and storytelling. She decided to pursue a career in journalism and landed a job at a top news outlet.

We gained knowledge on how to ask intelligent questions. I'd like you to share with us any two questions you'd like to ask yourself as part of your Saturday submission. The questions that you may have been hesitant to make, the questions that put you in a difficult situation, the inquiries that will have a significant impact on your career and future. For example:  1. What is the limit of my current capabilities and how can I push beyond them to continue learning and growing?\"
2. “How can I ensure that my actions align with my values and contribute to the greater good, rather than just maximizing my own success?\"

Looking forward to your response!
