25/09/23, 17:31 - Unknown Unknown: My understanding of 
Freelancing is that it is  a type of self-employment in which individuals offer their services to clients as independent contractors rather than as employees for a single employer. They typically work on a project basis, completing specific tasks or projects for clients while charging a fee. Freelance skills can include various activities such as writing, design, programming, marketing. 

I for one posse writing skills which is very advatangous in freelancing.  I developed a reading culture  at an early age. I  read extensively . Through my reading of different books,articles and journals I developed a great sense of writing skills. It was through reading that my vocabulary and written English greatly improved.  This is evident through the results i get in English language.  Throughout schooling my grades have been improving as well as vocabulary as I have not stop my culture of reading. 
In school, we constantly write composition.  These are stories or scenarios given that one gets to write about. 
It is for this reason that my writing skills keeps getting better and can work to my advantage as a freelancer
25/09/23, 17:57 - Unknown: Your understanding of freelancing is spot on. Freelancers indeed operate as independent contractors, offering their specialized services to clients on a project basis. Your insight into the world of freelancing is impressive, and it's clear that you have a strong foundation for success in this field.
27/09/23, 13:36 - Unknown Unknown: Good morning

I hope this message finds you well. I am excited to inform you that today's lesson will revolve around a crucial skill that can greatly impact your academic success: "Mastering Time Management During Exam Season."

24/05/23, 18:45 - Unknown: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian!
Hope are doing well.

‚ÄúWhen I discover who I am, I'll be free.‚Äù ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.

29/05/23, 17:31 - Unknown Unknown: l am a proud edoofian
29/05/23, 17:31 - Unknown: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.

""Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it."" ~ Bruce Lee

In this week's Wednesday lesson, you learned about the different sorts of personalities a person carries, but only a true leader is one who understands their personality and can do wonders with its power. In today's activity, I want you to dig deeper into your own consciousness and learn more about the kind of personality you are. As I believe, the more you know yourself, the clearer your vision of the world and your mind gets. Below is a link to a personality test, which you shall be taking up this week, and then would be sharing the results via a screenshot to your mentors by Monday. You can then read and understand more about your results by discussing them with your Mentor.

Link to the Test: -
https://my-personality-test.com/true-colours

This particular exercise is going to give you an insight into the kind of person you are so that you can use your strengths to yield the maximum benefits in whatever work you take up.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own personality while performing this activity.

13/06/23, 12:10 - Unknown: Greetings *Charlotte*,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some important news with you regarding our mentorship. I have recently been offered an exciting opportunity to take up a new role as the Head of the Division of Student Welfare, specifically focusing on the well-being of Edoofians in India. I am thrilled about this new responsibility and the chance to make a positive impact.
13/06/23, 12:29 - Unknown Unknown: that Is amazing congratulations
13/06/23, 12:35 - Unknown: Thank you so much!

13/06/23, 12:53 - Unknown: Thank you, Charlotte
13/06/23, 12:53 - Unknown: One of the main reasons I decided to take on this role is because I have had the privilege of interacting with Edoofians in India face-to-face for almost 2 years. Through these interactions, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges and struggles that students often face when they come to India. It can be a completely new and unfamiliar environment, and students may encounter various interactions and influences that can sometimes lead them astray or make poor choices.
13/06/23, 12:53 - Unknown: I firmly believe that it is our responsibility to ensure that students have a supportive and safe environment in which to pursue their education and personal growth. I want to help prevent situations where students may be influenced by wrong choices or misguided information. By being part of the Division of Student Welfare, I can actively work towards creating awareness, providing guidance, and supporting you throughout your educational journey.
13/06/23, 13:14 - Unknown Unknown: that Is amazing Sir  l really appreciate it
13/06/23, 13:40 - Unknown: I am thrilled to announce that a new chapter is beginning for both of us. As we move forward, I will be responsible to make your academic journey a success in India. From now on, You will be in capable hands of *Ms. Tenzin*. She will be taking over as your new EWYL Mentor, overseeing your EWYL Program. She is highly competent and dedicated, and I have no doubt that she will ensure the success of your program.

This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending ‚Äú I am a proud Edoofian‚Äù even on Sundays!

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven‚Äôt fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today‚Äôs Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

Let us have a longer discussion about your learnings in our upcoming session.

Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals towards achieving this goal. Today‚Äôs Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

Happy Learning!

17/12/22, 21:12 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special ‚Äî the receiver‚Äôs happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver‚Äôs eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, 
_I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?_

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!

hard work ,beleiving in yourself,confidence,passion ,ambition and never giving up are key points to become successful.
Patrice motivated me how it is to be a successful interpreneur be someone who can stick to a goal without giving up.He also showed great unity with his family by helping his parents ,
20/07/22, 05:21 - Unknown: I am really glad to hear your understanding of the activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY*. They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.
20/07/22, 05:21 - Unknown: Now please share your response to the weekend activity as well.
20/07/22, 05:29 - Unknown Unknown: also l learnt that to be successful you should be able to work with others have a huge exposure so that you can earn trust and can partner with others..

25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals¬†motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending ‚Äú I am a proud Edoofian‚Äù even on Sundays!

This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending ‚Äú I am a proud Edoofian‚Äù even on Sundays!

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

13/03/23, 14:26 - Aditi Kapoor: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he‚Äôd received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he‚Äôd paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

‚ÄúYour honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,‚Äù he replied.

‚ÄúHow do you weight the butter then?‚Äù Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

‚ÄúYour honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I‚Äôve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it‚Äôs the baker.‚Äù

She said that she is proud Edoofian and she seems like my sister when l ask some questions to her l am very happy to be part of Edoofa and I can say l am proud Edoofian.

And they believe in accessible,affordable education which leads to employment.

03/04/23, 20:36 - Aditi Kapoor: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn‚Äôt hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

04/01/23, 23:08 - Unknown: *Wednesday Lesson | 4 Jan*

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven‚Äôt fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today‚Äôs Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy learning.
05/01/23, 23:48 - Unknown: Edoofian, Punctuality in school life builds the path to success in a student's life by enabling them to plan ahead, make an efficient routine, and be prepared for their tasks. A punctual student is better equipped to deal with their day-to-day tasks than a person who leaves it for the last moment. Please note that we would only be able to earn the desired amount of credits if we are punctual at our session timings.

Before, We start with our next session, I would like you to specify the reason for your absence from Today's session by writing a letter to Ms Deepali, our Head of Department in the EWYL Group

16/07/22, 03:26 - Unknown: However, you know we have already partnered with the school, did you not ask the principal about the same?
16/07/22, 03:35 - Unknown Unknown: But when you gave me that project you said starting with my school
16/07/22, 17:46 - Unknown: yes Elshebba, however, you see you have to start with your school if the school is not a partner with Edoofa. In this scenario, your school is already a partner and thus, you wouldn't have to convince them, right?

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off

I want you to develop that kind of curiosity and work with me on your skills using Ms. Davi's lessons.
25/08/22, 17:52 - Unknown: If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more, you are a leader.  Quincy Adams

14/03/23, 01:21 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Vanessa!
How are you?
14/03/23, 01:22 - Aditi Kapoor: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
14/03/23, 01:22 - Aditi Kapoor: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.


If you are ready then we can begin?
14/03/23, 01:24 - Aditi Kapoor: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
14/03/23, 01:30 - Unknown Unknown: Thank you
14/03/23, 01:30 - Unknown Unknown: Yes I'm ready

14/03/23, 03:53 - Unknown Unknown: Project 2 
Community building
14/03/23, 21:03 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Vanessa!
How are you?
14/03/23, 21:04 - Aditi Kapoor: Please follow the daily ritual for today of saying 'I am a proud edoofian',
14/03/23, 21:05 - Aditi Kapoor: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù
14/03/23, 21:05 - Aditi Kapoor: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
14/03/23, 21:22 - Unknown Unknown: I'm a proud edoofian
14/03/23, 21:26 - Aditi Kapoor: Great to have you for the session!
14/03/23, 21:26 - Aditi Kapoor: So, let's continue our discussions on project.
14/03/23, 21:27 - Aditi Kapoor: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students for community building!
14/03/23, 21:27 - Aditi Kapoor: A] Through WhatsApp community groups:


STEP 1: You‚Äôre supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME\/MENTOR NAME\/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED
For eg: In your case it will be-
Vanessa\/Saloni\/14MAR2023
14/03/23, 21:27 - Aditi Kapoor: STEP 2: We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

As for attracting the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 5, and Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
14/03/23, 21:27 - Aditi Kapoor: Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to STUDY IN INDIA with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
14/03/23, 21:27 - Aditi Kapoor: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

And in a very similar manner, you can repeat the same process with the Form 5 students as well.
14/03/23, 21:39 - Unknown Unknown: Noted
14/03/23, 21:39 - Aditi Kapoor: Alright, I have noted your answer, the correct answer will be revealed shortly.","transform":"

15/03/23, 04:30 - Aditi Kapoor: There is no limit to it.

Till then, have a great day :fireworks:

13/07/22, 19:16 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

18/07/22, 02:47 - Unknown Unknown: By definition business is a situation or series of events typically done for profits reasons. Here in Zimbabwe the fast growing industries are ascending in order 
1
Agriculture sector 
2 mining 
3 manufacturing 
4oil and gas 
5 beauty and health care industries 
6 trucking 
7 retailing. 
 In agriculture the industries always grow with rapid response once you start. In agriculture there are strengths needed like hygiene standards, safe products, easy control on safety of production, labelling and easy traceability. However there are some weaknesses like lack of information, huge natural resources for example   mimie is one of the versatile companies where large number of huge natural  resources are available, each natural resource provide a potential to establish a new agro based industry and awareness for farmers, poor HAACP implementation
In agriculture industry, it is quite easy for individuals if you have strong links with the government.
In manufacturing it is a very precious industry and have good base of strength like, strong employee attitudes, excellent customer service, large market share, large market share, personal relationships with customers, leadership in product innovation, high integrity etc.

18/07/22, 20:05 - Unknown Unknown: Yes

18/07/22, 20:10 - Unknown: Glad to read your response for the weekend activity. I like how you chose this particular industry and how you have explained about it's growth in the time to come. Keep it up.
18/07/22, 20:10 - Unknown Unknown: Yes sir
18/07/22, 20:11 - Unknown Unknown: Sure sir
18/07/22, 20:15 - Unknown: Youa re going to pursue Agriculture for tyour higher education as well and to excel in it and innovate doing SWOT analysis is crucial. Right?
18/07/22, 20:20 - Unknown Unknown: Yes sir
18/07/22, 20:51 - Unknown: So Miriam, what is one insight about the industry that fascinated you the most?
18/07/22, 21:12 - Unknown Unknown: No need for me to look for employment I can be my own boss, since there is high rate of unemployment in Africa especially our country, again if I get a job I can work simultaneously in a company and my farm, and also in agriculture here there are empowering companies to the youths. Lastly there is money, agriculture covers many fields, it is the source of whole productions. It provides food needed by everyday since it's a basic need  , even if you are rich or poor you need to buy those things, because your stomaches digets everyday, industries will need drug plants, some raw materials eg sesame for oil, mbanjuana for drugs, cotton for wool, animals etc. In agriculture I can be an animal doctor and do you know that treating rich people s pets is expensive here in Africa
18/07/22, 23:12 - Unknown: Yes Miriam, however as a business owner you will create jobs for others right? And as a business owner, SWOT Analysis is much more crucial as your profits rely on the same.

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

12/07/22, 21:18 - Unknown Unknown: Greetings to you all 

I am a proud Edoofian by the name Blessing wachenuka

I would like to present to you the skills I think helps students in order to get a chance in participating in projects.
 Firstly to be given a chance to participate in project and earn more scholarship credits one should have skills like Active listening, being logic and reasoning , interpersonal skills and a skill to negotiate, communication skills , persuasion skill and having emotional intelligence. As a student of Edoofa one should always have the skill of communication especially when meeting with foreigners. I believe it is the most important skill that can always guide us in being in business with people from outside our countries. Looking at the persuasion skill I think it helps one in getting people agree with your ideas especially when it is positive, it also involves sharing of feelings and cleverly conveying information. Having emotional intelligence works as one should be clever enough to read someone's feelings and mood because it helps one not to just say what is not needed at the time, like for example one can not crack jokes even when people are doing serious business like related with school work. One should listen actively to the tasks given because it will not only be about being a quick writer but being reasonable in things we will be doing at school and it also helps in future at work. If one has that skill then that person is capable of facing any challenges coming his or her way now and in the future. If one has some of these skills it shows they're able to handle every difficult situation and can be the one to get the chance of participating in the next project. As there's a lot of learning in taking care of the challenges being faced
12/07/22, 21:19 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.

Now I get the 'process' that you were mentioning. I totally understand that Shantel, but I guess these are one-time investments in education and our future. When you will get into your dream college and will get a good job, you can definitely be able to cover all your expenses happily on your own.

18/07/22, 08:35 - Unknown Unknown: Shantel Bvukutwa has been a science student for 6 years not because she was forced to but due to her passion for saving lives. She always wanted to start a pharmaceutical business but the death of her partenal grandmother from Type 1 Diabetes due to insulin resistance fueled her passion in insulin production. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that develops when the body destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. She would like to produce insulin for diabetic patients and in the long run donate this medicine to those who cannot afford it. This company, Hopeshigh Insulin Productions, is also focussed on producing advanced formulas of the medicine to avoid death due to  insulin resistance. The company should start by a minimum number of 50 workers and it intends to focus on producing safe products. This business has no competition very much especially in the States since a few companies produce insulin so i can supply to a lot of people in this world. The production company will surely be a very smart area. Workers will work for 24 hours in order to meet the high demands and to promote effective work they should work in shifts. Heavy duty high technology machinery will be used to promote accuracy and safety. As for marketing, the company intends to supply their products making sure it reaches to everybody without fail by using marketing agents, supplying in all hospitals, pharmacies and using the help of Non Governmental Organisations.
18/07/22, 08:39 - Unknown Unknown: Managing a project requires more than the ability to herd cats and spin plates.  This is just one of the many skills needed for project management. Others include adaptability,  collaboration, communication, expertise as well as leadership. For someone to get projects that are challenging you must be adaptable. Communication is probably the most important skill . Communication goes beyond documentation. It also requires building a relationship with whoever you will be working with . If they don‚Äôt trust you, the project will fail. You must be willing to collaborate with your team.  You cannot be successful by yourself. Work with your team to achieve success. Lastly, leadership and expertise go hand-in-hand. If you can lead, you can deliver. Leadership is all about guiding, directing and motivating your team to do their best work and understand how their tasks contribute to the overall vision. Leadership comes with experience. Neither skills can be taught. They develop overtime from real life, practical experience.
18/07/22, 08:41 - Unknown Unknown: Zimbabwe's mining industry is focussed on a diverse range of small to medium mining operations. The most important minerals produced by Zimbabwe include gold, asbestos, chromite, coal and base metals. Zimbabwe‚Äôs mining sector is highly diversified, with close to 40 different minerals.  The predominant minerals include platinum, chrome, gold, coal, and diamonds.  The country boasts the second-largest platinum deposit and high-grade chromium ores in the world.  The minister of mines claims the sector has the potential to generate US$12 billion annually by 2023 if the government addresses challenges such as persistent power shortages, foreign currency shortages, and policy uncertainties. Companies are required to export all minerals through the state-owned Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe (MMCZ), with the exception of gold which must be sold to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe‚Äôs (RBZ) subsidiary Fidelity Printers and Refiners (FPR).  However, individual companies may receive permission from the government of Zimbabwe to sell minerals directly to avoid U.S.  targeted sanctions on the MMCZ. Zimbabwe‚Äôs top minerals include gold, platinum, chrome, coal, diamonds, and lithium.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

21/07/22, 23:55 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Trevor!
How's your day going?
22/07/22, 00:02 - Unknown: I am so happy and proud to see your enthusiasm and fire towards our daily ritual and your understanding of what being a proud edoofian denotes.?
22/07/22, 00:03 - Unknown: But I see you have typed 3, do you have any confusion Trevor ?
22/07/22, 00:04 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group.
22/07/22, 00:04 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
22/07/22, 00:08 - Unknown: I am sorry to ask you about the weekend activity, there was a confusion from my end and I am extremely apologetic on that Trevor.
22/07/22, 00:54 - Unknown: Along with this, let's move on with our session.
Successful people don‚Äôt blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our WEDNESDAY Wisdom was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
22/07/22, 00:54 - Unknown: I hope we are still connected, Trevor. You have seen my messages but did not reply. Are you facing any challenges Trevor?
22/07/22, 00:55 - Unknown: Please let me know, I am always here to solve them.
22/07/22, 01:13 - Unknown Unknown: Good day ma'am
I read the document on Wednesday wisdom l also listened to the audio
22/07/22, 01:26 - Unknown Unknown: It had a lot of teachings which involves learning on how to speak with others it also highlighted on accepting of failures and learning on how to tackle our challenges and taking  responsibility
22/07/22, 03:58 - Unknown Unknown: Very  sorry for that my phone fell in water so its perfoming very dismally
22/07/22, 04:21 - Unknown: No worries, I hope your device is functioning well now.
22/07/22, 04:22 - Unknown: I read your response Trevor and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one‚Äôs goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.

26/07/22, 18:16 - Unknown: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

Yesterday I had an amazing day. I went to the airport to receive all my proud Edoofians and I had tears in my eyes seeing their happiness and enthusiasm. I want you to look at it and share your thoughts with me.
26/07/22, 18:19 - Unknown: I read your understanding of the activity and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it‚Äôs not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you‚Äôre looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don‚Äôt do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it‚Äôs one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.

29/07/22, 00:53 - Unknown: Time management is defined as using your time productively and efficiently‚Äîbut what about when you are working as productively as possible, and you still can‚Äôt get everything done? It may be better to think about time management as a combination of working productively and prioritizing your time.

Our *Wednesday Wisdom* was all about Time Management and understanding the priority matrix to organize our tasks. 
I am really excited to hear your understanding and working on the same.
Please share it with me here.
In today's session we will talk about:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. progress on community building projects.
29/07/22, 05:40 - Unknown Unknown: I am a proud EDOOFIAN
29/07/22, 05:42 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.

01/08/22, 18:28 - Unknown: Hello *my proud EDOOFIAN*!‚≠ê
How did your weekend go?
I know we both have been connected in the EWYL Journey for a long time now. I know how _dedicatedly and consistently_ you work and make every session's discussion very productive and interactive. 
This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days:

*SESSIONS' DAYS*- I know you are very well aware that your *sessions* are scheduled on MONDAY and THURSDAY on the *EWYL Line*.

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on *Wednesday*.In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday  *EWYL Line*.

If you cannot attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
Keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the _EWYL Line_.

Hoping for an amazing week with you.?
01/08/22, 21:52 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. \r
Ôªø\r
So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending ‚Äú I am a proud Edoofian‚Äù even on Sundays!\r

Happy Weekend!\r

02/08/22, 00:52 - Unknown: A timetable is a framework that lets individuals see specific activities lined up. In this framework, it shows the tie allotment among several tasks and courses. It ensures equal distribution of time among activities and subjects, creates a smooth workflow, prevents wasting of time and efforts, and aids in creating good habits.
The *weekend activity* asked you to draw a timetable for yourself and of course, have time for your scheduled sessions as well.
I am really excited to see your timetable on the EWYL Line and of course, we can discuss how we can manage our sessions accordingly.
In this session today, we will discuss:
1. your timetable (as a part of the weekend activity)
2. progress on community building projects
3. pending understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom

15/07/22, 19:49 - Unknown: Yes, Changadzo
15/07/22, 22:09 - Unknown Unknown: Afternoon sir 

According to My understanding 

Patrice Motsepe inspired me through various things that are as follows.
 
In life to be successful you should have intrest in something through inspiration eg Motsepe was inspired by miners who bought beer from their shop


Secondly one should research inorder to know how to do things as Patrice used to reads books on mining

Furthermore one should try to unite with some proffessionals who know how to do your carrier eg patrice linked with Anglo.mining company that later sold their old mining shafts to Him through Godsell who made him to pay later on the amount demanded.
And also he linked with a platinum producing company and formed a well known company Modikwa.


Lastly one should try to overturn a problem in a business eg Motsepe seing that his business is not being productive he later on reduced the staff members and also stayed closer to his market for high management
15/07/22, 22:20 - Unknown: I am very happy after going through your response. ?
Proud Edoofians, These are the footsteps that we have to follow. The traits that he gained and possessed are not something that could be taught in schools\/ universities. That is why our head coach, Ms. Davi, tries that through every lesson you are able to get one step closer towards gaining these traits and making your career sucessful.
15/07/22, 22:50 - Unknown Unknown: I promise that l will do the same sir.?‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ

21/07/22, 20:02 - Unknown Unknown: _My Batch Group Name is *Batch A3*. I am here for my EWYL Session._
21/07/22, 20:47 - Unknown: Good Morning, Proud Edoofian ?
I hope that you are doing well
21/07/22, 20:51 - Unknown Unknown: Good morning Sir. I am fine.
21/07/22, 21:55 - Unknown: Tawananyasha, Can you please tell me what did we discuss in our EWYL Group this week?
21/07/22, 22:07 - Unknown Unknown: I heard an audio that teaches us to be confident in ourselves. I learnt that shifting blame on others does not bring any solution but identifying the problems surrounding us and finding measures to abate them is the solution. As people we should have positive mindset that will help us to solve whatever problem we face in life.
21/07/22, 22:14 - Unknown: Great!
Dear, May I know if you are aware about the proud Edoofian ritual?
21/07/22, 22:14 - Unknown Unknown: No sir.
21/07/22, 22:15 - Unknown: I am sharing a message with you below.
Please have a look at that once.
21/07/22, 22:16 - Unknown: Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"


Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you s
21/07/22, 22:18 - Unknown Unknown: Oh that one l know.
21/07/22, 22:23 - Unknown: Great!
Can you please share your understandings regarding this?
21/07/22, 23:10 - Unknown: Are we connected?
22/07/22, 03:41 - Unknown Unknown: An edoofian is someone who has goals to achieve and is focused, dedicated towards improving the living standards of the community surrounding him.
22/07/22, 03:42 - Unknown Unknown: Sorry my phone had a low battery so it was on the charger.
22/07/22, 17:43 - Unknown: Greetings Proud Edoofian ‚ú®
I hope that you are doing well

As August Intake is right at our doorsteps, So due to this many of our Edoofians will be arriving here in India to kick start their dream journey.?

I feel that it is my duty to make sure that the university has prepared well for their onboarding process.

This is why I would be visiting the universities Today in order to do a personal check up.
Since, This process would take up lots of time that is why we won't be able to connect Today.
However, I am sure that in my absence, You will make sure that you follow the below given things:

1. Make sure to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual at 9 AM Tomorrow.
2. Do submit the Wednesday Lesson before the deadline.

24/07/22, 03:26 - Unknown Unknown: Thank you. Good evening sir.
25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals¬†motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time.

13/07/22, 00:03 - Unknown Unknown: Saturday activity :
It is every student's goal to be considered for the more challenging projects that give the most learning opportunities. The only way to put oneself in a position of consideration is to uphold, what I believe, a few practices.
First, and foremost, is timekeeping. This means being punctual, turning up on time and submitting assignments before deadlines. The more challenging projects are likely to involve companies that have many demands to meet and not meeting them on time could cost the business. This means those that seem to have their affairs in order are the ones worthy of consideration.
A student also has to be transparent and honest. These skills make one a trustworthy individual as you almost always know what to expect from the student. This makes it easier for the higher-ups to assign tasks.
A person up for consideration should also show great commitment to their projects. It is never worth it to employ someone with extraordinary skills but no dedication as these skills are likely to go to waste.
Last, but not least, one should be capable of communicating effectively. It might be the most important one, because business is all about appealing and communicating effectively with the customers.
I believe that a combination of these skills makes for the perfect individual for any project.
13/07/22, 16:18 - Unknown: Good Morning, Gerald ?
I hope that you are good health and spirits
13/07/22, 16:18 - Unknown: Gerald, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.
This way you will always be recognized by the Academics Board for new projects.
13/07/22, 16:19 - Unknown: Also, Gerald, How was the call with Ms. Davi?
13/07/22, 20:18 - Unknown Unknown: We had a good and open conversation, and I believe the overall results look promising

Can you share your thoughts on the video?
Which part resonated with you the most?
13/07/22, 21:55 - Unknown Unknown: I believe the video is evidence of Edoofa's influence and people's acceptance of it in our country and on our continent. People showed up for the meet and greet, and this shows their commitment. They were also in great voice to outline their gratitude. There is gratitude on both sides, that of the founders and us the beneficiaries. I operate at a very unique wavelength, so it was kind of difficult to find what really resonates with me, but what is closest might be the testimonials from other Edoofians. I might be at the start of my journey, but I believe the program has already played a huge part in helping me realise my dreams by giving the platform.
13/07/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Yes, You are right!
I am sure that you must be motivated after seeing the video, right?

The aim of this activity is to make you aware of the life journey of Patrice Motsepe and how you can inculcate his traits in your daily life.
15/07/22, 21:18 - Unknown Unknown: I thought it was Friday 3pm
15/07/22, 21:37 - Unknown Unknown: Wednesday Lesson :
What I got from the document is that it does not matter where you are from, nor does the initial path you take matter. You can follow the path in front of you while you prepare yourself for the path that truly appeals to you. You use the knowledge you gain from the path you are on to set the groundwork for the path you really intend to take. Patrice successfully pursued his career while using that same career as a research tool for his passion. His hord work as a lawyer put him in good standing. It shows that if you work hard, in whatever field, you will be trusted to work even harder in a field you are really passionate about. Through hard work, perseverance, patience and thorough research, Patrice eventually achieved his dream, even if the way he started out did not suggest he would.
15/07/22, 22:02 - Unknown: I am very happy after going through your response. ?
Proud Edoofians, These are the footsteps that we have to follow. The traits that he gained and possessed are not something that could be taught in schools\/ universities. That is why our head coach, Ms. Davi, tries that through every lesson you are able to get one step closer towards gaining these traits and making your career sucessful.

16/07/22, 18:00 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.

17/03/23, 22:42 - Aditi Kapoor: Meanwhile you opted for the community building project, let me share with you how my good students have worked on it.
I want that you utilize today's time and work on it.
17/03/23, 22:42 - Aditi Kapoor: We will discuss it tomorrow.
17/03/23, 22:44 - Aditi Kapoor: A] Through WhatsApp community groups:


STEP 1: You‚Äôre supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME\/MENTOR NAME\/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED
For eg: In your case it will be-
Manasseh\/Saloni\/17MAR2023
17/03/23, 22:44 - Aditi Kapoor: STEP 2: We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

As for attracting the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 5, and Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
17/03/23, 22:44 - Aditi Kapoor: Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to STUDY IN INDIA with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
17/03/23, 22:45 - Aditi Kapoor: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

And in a very similar manner, you can repeat the same process with the Form 5 students as well.
18/03/23, 20:47 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings *my proud edoofian*!

Here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!
18/03/23, 20:47 - Aditi Kapoor: How is your mother now Manasseh?

In the past couple of days, You might have noticed that I was not very active on the EWYL DEDICATED LINE.

This was due to Arrival of 72 Edoofians who came this week.

Today is the last day of their Admission Processes, So I would be visiting the universities to make sure everything goes well.

We will be starting our regular sessions with full flow from *Monday*.
Till then, I would like you to work on the *EWYL PROJECTS*.

Also, Make sure that you perform the *Proud Edoofian* Ritual on the *EWYL DEDICATED LINE* on Saturday and Sunday as well.
The chain should not break.

Have a blessed day ahead‚≠ê

Rituals¬†motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending ‚Äú I am a proud Edoofian‚Äù even on Sundays!

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off

19/07/22, 23:36 - Unknown: hello Claudett, how are you doing? I am Mr. Anshul.
19/07/22, 23:36 - Unknown: Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"
19/07/22, 23:36 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù
19/07/22, 23:36 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
19/07/22, 23:37 - Unknown Unknown: I am well sir, thank you
19/07/22, 23:58 - Unknown: That is good Claudett.
19/07/22, 23:59 - Unknown: So what message do you have to send on this line on a daily basis?
20/07/22, 00:00 - Unknown Unknown: I am a proud Edoofian?
20/07/22, 00:02 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.

Greeting of the day, my proud Edoofian! How are you doing?
21/07/22, 20:56 - Unknown: Amazing work on the Community building project Claudett. how was your interaction with these students?
21/07/22, 20:58 - Unknown Unknown: I'm doing great sir I hope you're well too
21/07/22, 20:59 - Unknown Unknown: It was well sir, a lot are eager to know more about Edoofa and my experience ,they are also looking forward to hear from me as soon as I get to India
21/07/22, 21:01 - Unknown: This is amazing Claudett, now you know how easy it is for you to earn credits by performing onthe projects and it helps you learn 21st century skills and become employable. Right?
21/07/22, 21:01 - Unknown: Doesn't it excite you?
21/07/22, 21:02 - Unknown Unknown: Yes I do
21/07/22, 21:02 - Unknown Unknown: It excites me more than the word 'excite' itself
21/07/22, 21:59 - Unknown: Amazing Claudett, now keep this momentum going.
21/07/22, 21:59 - Unknown: Did you work on the Wednesday wisdom Claudett? What are your takeaways from it?
21/07/22, 21:59 - Unknown Unknown: Indeed!
21/07/22, 22:00 - Unknown Unknown: Of course I did work on the wisdom lesson
21/07/22, 22:04 - Unknown: Amazing Claudett, then now share your takeaways from it.
21/07/22, 22:09 - Unknown Unknown: The main lesson I learnt is that we should make sure that we have mastered the right attitude.


In the story of the sea and the sailor, I admire this attitude that the sea had. We see that even when the sea was pinched by the sailor's words, it didn't want to trouble the sailor anymore. Somehow I have realised that even if people hurt you , do not or wish to hurt them back. I believe that's what defines us as Edoofians, we wish everybody wellness.

Secondly, I somehow did not like this other attitude which was portrayed by the sea that moment when it confronted the sailor as a dasmel. I believe there was no need for the sea to explain itself. Like for real, if you are a good person , you are and you do not have to explain yourself only to make others feel sorry and guilty.


For example,suppose you're the class president and you were assigned the duty of making sure that your classroom is well organised and everybody does things according to the book then one of these days a group of bad guys are creating havoc in the class , throwing litter everywhere and so forth and Unfortunately, the school principal walks in only to see the classroom disorganised .Obviously he will look up to the class president to explain and then the class president just points to that group of bad guys. As expected of the school principal, he gives those guys a stiff penalty. As a class president, it wouldn't be reasonable to be found confronting the bad boys only to say things like \" Guys you know that I am a good person , I left you doing whatever you want but it is just that the principals are just too much so I had no choice rather to point you out as the main culprits\" Now you are blaming the school principal.
21/07/22, 22:13 - Unknown Unknown: I also noticed that the sailor blamed the sea and the sea also blamed the cruel winds probably the winds were also going to blame someone. So at the end just like Ms Davi said it, all dissatisfaction and failure in life is caused by the propensity to place the blame somewhere else. Inorder to be a successful person you should not put the blame on others especially for your failures instead, take responsibility and keep on trying because at the end failure is a choice.
21/07/22, 22:15 - Unknown Unknown: I also learnt that you need to keep on trying, persisting and adding on a little enthusiasm because it is not all the times that things work according to your way. Some days are better than others and some are worse but you need to stay positive, focused and remain determined
21/07/22, 23:50 - Unknown: Good to read your response on this lesson Edoofian! I am glad that you were able to understand the crux of that which is that successful people don‚Äôt blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it.
21/07/22, 23:50 - Unknown: Do you believe you do the same thing Claudett?
22/07/22, 00:55 - Unknown Unknown: ? Sometimes I blame situations for my failure but now that I am aware of the drawbacks of blaming others, from now on I will be more conscious.
22/07/22, 01:36 - Unknown: Yes Claudett and that has to change.
22/07/22, 01:36 - Unknown: Let's say you are working on projects and face challenges on them. How do you proceed with it?
22/07/22, 01:38 - Unknown Unknown: Firstly, I think it will be wiser to ask for assistance from someone who has better knowledge on the project.
22/07/22, 01:38 - Unknown Unknown: I am working on it.
22/07/22, 01:44 - Unknown: Yes Claudett, first you should seek guidance from me as i am your mentor.
22/07/22, 01:44 - Unknown: You have to be the owner of your success, you will face many challenges in terms of time management, internet and in regards to efficiency on the projects as well. However, you will have to make sure that you are working on the projects and making the best of the opportunity right?
22/07/22, 01:45 - Unknown Unknown: Okay sir , I haven taken note of everything.
22/07/22, 01:49 - Unknown Unknown: It is indeed a pleasure to have you as my mentor.
22/07/22, 02:10 - Unknown: So now how do you believe you have to use this approach and mindset on your projects Edoofian? Such as the community building project, Corporate alliance project or the School connect project?
22/07/22, 02:19 - Unknown Unknown: I think that, especially for the above 3 projects, whenever I face a challenge let us say I am struggling with answering some questions which would have been asked by a student or the principal , I should seek guidance from you first before answering.
22/07/22, 18:09 - Unknown Unknown: Good morning dear mentor!

A growth mindset is the mental acceptance that one can acquire knowledge, change and improve with time and effort. The growth mindset of successful people has the following traits.
\r
Successful people accept failure and learn from their past mistakes. They know that it is okay to fail and also it is not okay to quit trying just because you fail the first time. They take failure as another way of learning and improve their skills to become better.
\r
Successful people also appreciate constructive criticism. They do not see criticism as an adversary aiming to attack but they see criticism as a teacher who is there to polish their flaws hence, they appreciate and start working on their flaws.
\r
Age knows no limit  when it comes to matters of learning. All successful people knows this hence build a habit of continuous improvement and accomplish more without considering their ages. 
\r
Successful people constantly remember their dreams, goals and ambitions such that they do not get distracted by other things. 
\r
As an Edoofian, I am going to write down all my goals such that each and every morning I read them from my diary and get reminded of why I started this journey.

03/03/23, 01:28 - Aditi Kapoor: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
03/03/23, 01:28 - Aditi Kapoor: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
03/03/23, 01:28 - Aditi Kapoor: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.

03/03/23, 23:02 - Aditi Kapoor: Please take note of your session time and date.
03/03/23, 23:02 - Aditi Kapoor: Also, please follow the daily ritual of saying I am a proud edoofian for today.
03/03/23, 23:03 - Aditi Kapoor: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù
03/03/23, 23:03 - Aditi Kapoor: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
04/03/23, 15:54 - Unknown Unknown: Good morning.

06/03/23, 15:44 - Aditi Kapoor: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he‚Äôd received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he‚Äôd paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

‚ÄúYour honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,‚Äù he replied.

‚ÄúHow do you weight the butter then?‚Äù Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

‚ÄúYour honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I‚Äôve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it‚Äôs the baker.‚Äù
06/03/23, 20:58 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Sibonginkhosi!
How are you?
06/03/23, 20:58 - Aditi Kapoor: In today's session on the EWYL Line only, we will discuss:
1) Weekend activity
2) Project Discussion
06/03/23, 21:01 - Aditi Kapoor: You know the opinions of both the question will completely differ with students but one thing that is common is that they strive to move ahead in life and take this motivation to next level. I have heard one quote on it, let me share it with you:
''One of the best ways to achieve career success is to keep assessing your performance. Don't wait for your annual appraisal ‚Äì do it yourself. An ideal way to do this would be to identify quantifiable goals and set a timeline for achieving them. Start with setting short-term goals when you're new to a job.''

Your response just reflects how passionate you are towards your journey in the EWYL Program with me.
06/03/23, 21:02 - Unknown Unknown: I am well thanks and yourself Ms Saloni?.How was your weekend
06/03/23, 21:02 - Aditi Kapoor: I am doing good, thank you.
06/03/23, 21:02 - Aditi Kapoor: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students for community building project.
06/03/23, 21:02 - Aditi Kapoor: STEP 1: You‚Äôre supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME\/(slash)MENTOR NAME\/(SLASH)DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED
For eg: a student named Tendai who formed the group on 1st February will name it-
TENDAI\/MENTOR NAME\/1FEB2023
06/03/23, 21:03 - Unknown Unknown: Noted and well understood
06/03/23, 21:03 - Aditi Kapoor: STEP 2: We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
06/03/23, 21:03 - Aditi Kapoor: As for attracting the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 5, and Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).


Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
06/03/23, 21:03 - Aditi Kapoor: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to STUDY IN INDIA with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

And in a very similar manner, you can repeat the same process with the Form 5 students as well.
06/03/23, 21:06 - Unknown Unknown: Noted so per week I need to gather about 15 students
06/03/23, 21:39 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, this is the least number that we have to get.
06/03/23, 21:39 - Aditi Kapoor: Did you form the group?
06/03/23, 21:48 - Unknown Unknown: Do I have to add you as well
06/03/23, 22:20 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, you have to add me as well.
06/03/23, 22:21 - Aditi Kapoor: The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill

13/10/22, 01:27 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.

Hope you are doing well. This week we learned about one of the most popular yet grounded people who used social media as a tool to become an educator and give back to the community and still become an entrepreneur.
This week I want you to reflect on what your strengths and skills are to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 

These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content etc.
Please share these skills and instances where you were able to showcase these skills in your next session.
Till then 
Happy Learning!

20/10/22, 01:03 - Unknown: Hello, My Proud Edoofian.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

Today, At all costs, I would need the submission for the Last week's Saturday Activity.
I am sharing it below.

We can not allow ourselves to at a such mediocre pace.
If somehow, You have not received it, I am sharing it below again.
13/10/22, 22:00 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.
13/10/22, 22:01 - Unknown: Now, I am sharing Last week‚Äôs Saturday Activity below:

Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!
13/10/22, 22:13 - Unknown Unknown: From this story the greatest lesson that l learnt was the power of social media. Social media cam help one change his \/her life. It helps one to fully express oneself. And it can be a ln source of income. It doesn't require shortcuts with or without enough resources. One can therefore become an employer through the good use of social media.
13/10/22, 22:13 - Unknown Unknown: I will submit the video tomorrow at 6 pm

\"The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you.\" ‚Äî B.B. King
18/10/22, 20:37 - Unknown: I would like to brief you first on the topics that we have to cover in our Today‚Äôs session.
1. We will discuss if you have submitted the Wednesday Audio Lesson or not
2. After that, I will be sharing the Saturday‚Äôs Activity with you which was not shared on Saturday due to some technical challenges.
3. At the end, We will be discussing the Project that you want to work on this week and the target that you have set for yourself regarding that project
18/10/22, 20:37 - Unknown: Let me first start by sharing the Saturday‚Äôs Activity:
25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals¬†motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending ‚Äú I am a proud Edoofian‚Äù even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:34 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn‚Äôt hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

Ready for your dose of Wednesday wisdom?

I want to ask you a question: Have you Despised Wealth?

The concept of wealth has been a topic of much debate and discussion for centuries. While some view wealth as a means to achieve success and fulfillment, others may view it with suspicion or even disdain. However, it is important to understand that ethical wealth creation is possible and can be a force for good in the world. In this regard, it is essential to examine our own perspectives on wealth creation, and consider how they may impact our relationship with money, status, and success.

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!","transform":"

I am pleased to observe that a majority of you comprehended well, the message  that was conveyed in this week's Wednesday wisdom. It brought me great joy to go through student‚Äôs perspectives on wealth creation and the mindset essential for embarking on this path.

I have a special Saturday assignment for you. The objective of this assignment is to help you understand the steps you can take to prepare yourself for wealth creation. The assignment will encourage you to identify their goals, develop a financial plan, and cultivate the mindset and habits needed to achieve financial success.

Here are some instructions to make it easy for you to work on this assignment:
1. Goal Setting: The first step towards wealth creation is to set clear and achievable goals. In this section, write down your short-term and long-term financial goals. Explain how each goal will contribute to your overall financial success.
2. Financial Planning: A financial plan is a roadmap that outlines how you will achieve your financial goals. In this section, develop a comprehensive financial plan that includes strategies for budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management. Identify the resources you will need to achieve your financial plan and explain how you will access them.
3. Mindset and Habits: Wealth creation is not just about having a financial plan; it is also about cultivating the mindset and habits that will help you achieve your goals. In this section, identify the mindset and habits that are necessary for financial success. Explain how you will cultivate these qualities in yourself and develop strategies to overcome any obstacles that may arise.
4. Conclusion: In this section, summarize your findings and discuss the importance of preparing yourself for wealth creation. Reflect on what you have learned throughout the assignment and discuss how you will apply these principles in your own life.

15/07/22, 16:27 - Unknown Unknown: The story of Patrice Thopane Mopetse inspired me in many ways . His background check connected back to myself wich made me relate with the story in a much deeper way any of the other edoofians will.
My learnings from Patrice's story include the one that being from a poor family or from a family which is looked down apon doesnt push back further away from ur dreams. Rather ,it is an encouragement and a push factor fir one to change his life . 
Perseverance of Thopane from a stage if being a son of a spaza shop owner to the Chief  Executive Officer of Anglo's gold and uranium taught me a very vital fact in life . Nomatter how hard thing may get or seen , one should continue keeping on , one should never give up what he wants till he gets it .
Discipline is something I also learnt from Patrice . He didn't deny helping his father in the work of the spaza shop and this helped him to have patience as he served consumers .

I will be spending the whole day tomorrow with my sisters. As it is one of the major holidays in India, Therefore, We won't be able to have any sessions tomorrow.

In my absence, I am sure that you will make sure that you:

11/08/22, 20:06 - Unknown Unknown: *For the Wednesday lesson .* 

I have learnt tt success doesnt come easily to anyone at all . There are three mantras that should be chanted everyday by anyone who wants to be successful in life . 
 
The first one iis, *forget chance live with intent.it* was written that a few things happen by chance in everyone's  lives . therefore one must not wait for a chance to come ,rather the person should accelerate towards wat he or she wants to become . Someone illustrated that if you keep trying ,you can walk through the wall once in a zillion times 

The other mantra one has to chant is ones should *stop fixating on failures .* All the people axe not perfect ,we fall but what we have to do at the end is rise again . Keeping yourself regreting about the past events is worthless.one cant change what has already happened buh has to learn from it so as to make a better future .

And the last one is *findind one's inspiration* . One has to know why he or she does what they do . This will help people find their purpose in life .


 _This was my understanding of the Wednesday lesson . Thank you_
11/08/22, 22:06 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending ‚Äú I am a proud Edoofian‚Äù even on Sundays!

04/08/22, 18:53 - Unknown Unknown: good afternoon
04/08/22, 20:04 - Aditi Kapoor: Good day my proud Edoofian!! How are you today?
04/08/22, 20:04 - Aditi Kapoor: Did you read the super interesting story of 19 year old Gilbert Eugene Peters from Zimbabwe that I shared with you yesterday?

I am sure you must have found his life inspiring and learnt a few things from it.
04/08/22, 20:33 - Unknown Unknown: yes yes thats very true
04/08/22, 20:33 - Unknown Unknown: I did
04/08/22, 21:26 - Aditi Kapoor: Great, now please share with me your takeaways from the life story of Gilbert Eugene Peters are?
04/08/22, 21:38 - Unknown Unknown: I've learnt that a dream is just a seed which you should not give up on but should water so that it blossoms. I also took note of the concept of hardwork to accomplish our dreams
05/08/22, 01:24 - Aditi Kapoor: Good to read your understanding of the lesson Emeni. The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years. The price is knowing that time is working on your side even when the results don‚Äôt show it.
05/08/22, 01:25 - Unknown Unknown: thats very true
05/08/22, 01:25 - Unknown Unknown: You are one wise man Sir
05/08/22, 02:02 - Aditi Kapoor: You see Emeni, a lack of consistency keeps ordinary people from achieving extraordinary results. Excelling at the small choices that compound over time perpetually leaves you in favorable circumstances. No matter what happens in the world, you‚Äôre never in a position where you are forced into a bad decision.
05/08/22, 02:54 - Unknown Unknown: yes
05/08/22, 02:54 - Unknown Unknown: you have the power to decide what you want to do and be
05/08/22, 18:44 - Unknown Unknown: good morning

05/08/22, 18:45 - Unknown Unknown: you still haven't told me my point balance yet?
05/08/22, 18:46 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.

05/08/22, 23:56 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello Emeni!
05/08/22, 23:56 - Aditi Kapoor: So in other words success is a product of what ideas we create and choices we make in our everyday life.

This is why I share the lessons and activities with you on a daily basis. Right?
05/08/22, 23:57 - Aditi Kapoor: As I shared earlier Emeni, I need time to calculate, however, you have not earned credits till last month.

06/08/22, 02:44 - Unknown Unknown: She really encourages me
06/08/22, 22:25 - Aditi Kapoor: This is good to know Emeni, did you research about it on Linkedin as well?
06/08/22, 22:31 - Unknown Unknown: unfortunately, she is not on linkedin yet but I told her about it.
08/08/22, 16:41 - Unknown Unknown: good morning

08/08/22, 16:43 - Unknown Unknown: here's the essay
08/08/22, 16:44 - Unknown Unknown: Success will never come when one gives up trying to reach it. Success is primarily a result of the effort one puts in. The one who has the greatest amount of hardwork, dedication, and skill, will be the one who becomes most successful. Hard work, dedication, and skill are all three difficult goals to be the best at. Thats the character I saw in him which helped him to be where he is right now.

Happy New week edoofian! How was your weekend?
08/08/22, 19:21 - Aditi Kapoor: Amazing work on the activity Edoofian, Do you believe that you have some of these traits as well?

If yes, what are the those and which ones do you think you need to inculcate in yourself to be successful like Gilbert Peters?
08/08/22, 20:23 - Unknown Unknown: the weekend was boring ?. i didn't have anything fun to do
08/08/22, 20:24 - Unknown Unknown: i think I'm lacking proper skill because I know hardwork and dedication. If I didn't, I wouldn't be where I'm at right now
08/08/22, 20:58 - Aditi Kapoor: As I mentioned earlier that continuous learning is a must for a student, and the industry leaders are a great source to learn from as their experiences and struggles can be a great source of inspiration.

20/08/22, 23:40 - Unknown Unknown: .As a social worker I have done a number of projects aimed at assisting the underprivileged. I sourced funds from well-wishers and assisted ten primary school learners with school fees, exercise books and uniforms. I was working in the junior outgoing junior president of Zimbabwe as her personal assistant. It was during this period that we sourced the assistance for ten underprivileged learners from ten primary schools that are feeder schools to our high school. We talked to local business people about our idea and they offered us school stationary. We also sourced the money for uniforms from well-wishers from South Africa. A brother to the junior president resident in South Africa assisted us with the funds after we discussed with him about the plight of our learners back home. In other words, it calls for advocacy to come up with such a program.  I had chance to advocate for assistance from UNICEF towards the support of our school learners. At the beginning of this school term we had visitors from UNICEF who came to address the outgoing junior president. Since she is a learner living with a disability, they were eager to interview her on how she grew and become a junior president. The officials were keen to interview me as well ,being the personal assistant. I took this chance to make it clear that our school had limited user friendly facilities such as ramps on toilets and classrooms to allow for free passage of wheelchairs. I also requested for a school truck. During our tenure in the junior parliament we were invited for meetings with government ministers and the president as well. At times we arrived late for such meetings because using public transport with someone disabled was difficult hence the request. I also requested for teaching and learning material like computers, projectors white boards and flipcharts and the officials promised to look into it.  I campaigned for youths to stop drug and substance abuse. During a visit to the president‚Äôs

I will have a thorough discussion in our forthcoming session about what you think were the factors that led to the success of the three panelists listed here after you have carefully listened to the audio file and read the PDF.

Happy learning!

14/07/22, 22:02 - Unknown: Hello *my proud EDOOFIAN*!

From his dad‚Äôs small foray into entrepreneurship, Patrice Motsepe got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe‚Äôs success story is a remarkable one showing how curiosity, doggedness, perseverance, and the knack to exploit great opportunities as they come, can determine how successful or not, any individual could become. 
And this was all about our WEDNESDAY WISDOM.
Hope you have gone through it.
I am so excited to listen to your thoughts and views on the *EWYL Line*.
14/07/22, 23:02 - Unknown Unknown: when l read Patrice's story l was overwhelmed. He did not give up whatsoever when he was denied loans by banks when he wanted to buy a shaft instead he kept on pushing. He was someone who was eager to learn e even from a tender age when he used to help his father in the shop which shows us that the knowledge that we acquire at a young age may not make sense at that moment but it will become of great use in the future. l think everyone would wish to become like Patrice. l also would want to become great like him or even more, which will take my hard work, research anx perseverance to be like so.
15/07/22, 02:50 - Unknown: I read your response Eugenia and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a way. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. With can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.

20/07/22, 20:50 - Unknown Unknown: Agriculture is the fast growing business in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's commercial farmung sector is traditionally a source of exports and foreign exchange. Additionally, the International crops. Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (lCRISAT) assits Zimbabwe's farmers to adopt conversation agriculture techniques. Furthermore, the institute helps in increasing yield through a sustainable method of farming. Hence, you can consider starting a business in the agriculture and farming sector in Zimbabwe.
 Thus having strength of having good climate, relatively low labour and growing coordination amongst fruit producers with formation of IPE  fruits

Though some weaknesses are experienced like EAC changes meaning increased competition for local providers and processors in the sector and also climate changes due to unpredictable weather patterns and lack of historical data undermine potential for development of agricultural development. It looks forward to opportunities involving new available techniques to improve the productivity and quality of crops (product and quality upgrading).
20/07/22, 21:02 - Unknown: I read your response Eugenia and it made me so inquisitive to know more about agriculture in Zimbabwe look what I found -send  Zimbabwe is overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture. Agriculture accounts for 18% of Zimbabwe's GDP as of 2015. Agriculture enabled people to produce surplus food. There are different crops that farmers grow and some of these include, maize, sorghum, rapoko, groundnuts, round-nuts, and beans.
Your response reflects clarity in the way you have expressed and so thoughtfully you have penned down your thoughts.
20/07/22, 21:02 - Unknown: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader. 
Also Eugenia, along with the SWOT analysis of a company, I would appreciate it if you also share a SWOT analysis of yourself. I want to see how much more you have learned beyond this activity.

21/07/22, 21:07 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Eugenia!
How's your day going?
21/07/22, 21:10 - Unknown: I need one help from you Eugenia, the audio that you sent me stating your concerns about the meeting yesterday, can you please pen down your concerns and send it to me as a text?
I will show that to the meeting head and it will become very easier for him to address this concern because along with you, 6-7 students were facing the same problem. 
I ensure you that you won't miss out on anything.
21/07/22, 21:11 - Unknown: Successful people don‚Äôt blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our *WEDNESDAY Wisdom* was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects (3 projects)
3. you will share your concerns in written with me so that I can share the same ahead.
21/07/22, 21:38 - Unknown: Also I want to applaud you for the successful completion of the Isaac project, I am so glad that completed your target on time. Makes me so proud of you right now. Whenever any project will come up with Ms. Sanjana, our project head, I will surely come up with your name. :clap:
22/07/22, 02:49 - Unknown Unknown: Greetings l am doing great ma'am how are you
22/07/22, 02:56 - Unknown Unknown: noted thank you so much ma'am
22/07/22, 03:31 - Unknown Unknown: some people on the other hand do not blame the world after not archiving something. They accept personal responsibility.,learn from thei mistakes and do something about it. When you want to archive something in life you need to work hard, have a positive mind and keep on being determined. Successful people do blame anyone for failing to do something but accept their mistakes and do something about it
22/07/22, 04:12 - Unknown Unknown: 1
22/07/22, 04:34 - Unknown: I am doing great Eugenia, thanks for asking.
22/07/22, 04:34 - Unknown: I read your response Eugenia and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one‚Äôs goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
22/07/22, 04:35 - Unknown: So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom (already done)
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects (3 projects)  left
3. you will share your concerns in writing with me so that I can share the same ahead.  left

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

As a country ,we ought to have a unifying factor as one,be united and focusing on one goal and that's to be successful as a country and preparing for the future.

And in what better way than in improving the economical status of the nation ,and that's through doing good  businesses to improve the economy and preparing for the future and considering the future generation .

In my country the fast growing industry is of fishing. Fishing as seem to be playing a pivotal role in the lives of people as well as the economy. It has provided the nation with foreign currency to help stabilise the nation,as we are still a developing country and need all the help we can get to develop the country through the revenues collected.

Fishing has helped people in their homes and it seems to be a growing business as everyone who is anyone is doing it ,for the seek of feeding their families in the same time improving the economy hence making fishing a good fast growing business.

Through this fishing industry ,it is guaranteed that the future of the country is safe and much predictable that the future will benefit,and judging from this pace it  can put our country in the map in some 5 to 6 years.

23/07/22, 20:37 - Unknown: Sat Activity:Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
This week, we discovered that people who are successful don't hold the world responsible for their failures. They accept accountability for their own choices and results. To develop this mindset of taking responsibility for everything and avoiding the blame game takes time and focus. As your Saturday Assignment your are required to write a short write up, on the growth mindset of successful people and how will you make sure you develop the same mindset. The word limit for this assignment is 150-200 words. Kindly make sure you follow the word limit strictly, any responses less than the minimum word limit will not be marked.
You are required to submit the same by Monday 10 AM  on the dedicated EWYL line.

Happy learning !

25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals¬†motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending ‚Äú I am a proud Edoofian‚Äù even on Sundays!

26/07/22, 21:35 - Unknown Unknown: Yes I'm still on it, submitting  now
26/07/22, 22:58 - Unknown Unknown: *Answers*

1: _How will I make sure ,being an Edoofian I will do the same._


Being an Edoofian, goes with a lot of hardworking ,determination and commitment. So as one I would personally want to see Edoofa go to greater heights ,I mean even more greater heights.As an Edoofian I will make sure that I try by all means to put Edoofa in the spotlight and that's so by preaching about it,telling students ,parents of what this program does. How it had helped me as an individual till this far ,how it benefits the African students by offering them an opportunity to study quality education abroad as well as the benefits of doing the EWYL projects.

In this way  I'm sure Edoofa will go to higher heights regardless of how people may view it in their own perspectives. But as long as it holds up to it's true mission ,it shall prosper and I will see to it that Edoofa does reach greater heights. 



2:Contributions that I will be making to ensure everyone in the Edoofa community experiences a sense of oneness, would be by working together obviously, if one suggests an idea I will make I listen to the idea being raised ,whether it would about elevating Edoofa and beyond  one has got to listen to the other and show that together we are one.
Nobody is inferior to the other as all we are Edoofians,in fact a community of proud Edoofians .

Also to ensure oneness in the Edoofa family ,I would call up meetings so that we would meet and discuss a way forward as Edoofians that way nobody would feel left behind  as we are together and going forward with one motive in mind and that's to wear the Edoofa flag with pride ,let everyone see how amazing and beneficial this program is.
26/07/22, 23:18 - Unknown Unknown: Madam I've completed  the questions ,there are above
27/07/22, 00:00 - Unknown: I would like yo add to your understanding,
Actions that are based on the principles of Oneness are rewarding in the sense that they fill us with happiness and joy, whether or not you get your desired results. Just the act of committing to the effort makes us feel connected to everything and can help heal isolation, loneliness, and helplessness.
27/07/22, 01:06 - Unknown Unknown: Okay madam I understand, I think I missed that point but now its clear,
27/07/22, 17:16 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian, wake up and seize the day!

This is an oppurtunity to businesses an industry sector because the more the population the more the potential customers. when there are more customers means more profits for the business. By this the business my rapidy grow.  This shown Zimbabwe had estimated population of 14.501 million in the year 2016 and Per capita GDP was estimated at USD 977.444 whereas in 2022 population expected to reach 16.908 million by 2022, per capita GDP was estimated to be at USD 1970.26.\r

Personally I found it very interesting as it discussed the life and struggles of Patrice, an African Billionaire and I believe my students should take inspiration from him.
16/07/22, 03:59 - Unknown Unknown: I was inspired by this story
Especially because of his risk taking ability, he bought a mine shaft that was not believed to be profitable and  also on credit !
I also loved the fact that before he got into the mining business , he researched about it and had all the knowledge he needed
16/07/22, 21:38 - Unknown: Amazing work on the Lesson task. I saw that Patrice had the wisdom to recognize and grab the opportunities that time brought for him and that is what set him apart from others and made him who he is.

18/07/22, 08:03 - Unknown Unknown: The beauty industry is an industry that has been fast growing in Zimbabwe in the last 3 years. With new and innovative ways of making women feel beautiful.These include lace front closure wigs and bidding nails.Before people had not fully embraced the idea of makeup as elders preferred natural beauty. The beauty Industry has been fast growing seeing an increase in the number of beauty parlors available in the CBD and residential areas.Recently , Fenti a beauty company owned by Rihanna , an American singer found its way to Zimbabwe and this alone proves that they were sure of mar availability. The ministry of small to medium enterprises in Zimbabwe has also started channeling money to these salons as most of them are small businesses.The strength of these business is that more youths are being trained for beauty courses at Community innovation hubs so the beauty salons always have enough manpower to handle any number of customers. Weakness arise from lack of funding to expand businesses.This includes loans and most banks usually turn down loan application from small businesses as the usually don't have collateral.  Opportunities have risen from the fix and supply method.This is when a salon sells hair extensions, wigs , closures , nails and nail polishes to their customers .This is a chance for them to be one stop shops and also offers an increase in profits. Threat arises from salons that can be each others vicinity.This is because each salon will have to prove itself and this means more money will be spent on advertisements and new and trendind material.

Rest of the things we will discuss during your session.
14/07/22, 18:44 - Unknown Unknown: Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe a  South African businessman and the country‚Äôs first black billionaire. Motsepe made his fortune through mining interests that eventually expanded in 2004 to form a successful multifaceted mining company, African Rainbow Minerals (ARM).

In spite of having grown up in the apartheid era, Motsepe fared better than many other South African blacks. Throughout his youth Motsepe worked at his father‚Äôs store and beer hall, a job that gained him essential lessons in business management and exposed him to the lives of the mine workers who bought their daily provisions from him.

Motsepe then earned a bachelor‚Äôs degree in law from the University of Swaziland and a law degree from the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. He joined the law firm of Bowman Gilfillan in 1988 and became a partner in 1993, having worked as a visiting attorney with the American law firm McGuire, Woods, Battle & Booth in 1991‚Äì92.  This marked the beginning of his business journey. Motsepe left to apply his business acumen to the mining trade. He believed that he could use management techniques, such as low base pay coupled with production incentives, to transform less-productive shafts into moneymaking operations. Even more important, he found ways to benefit from the country‚Äôs Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) laws. In 1994 Motsepe founded a mine services company, Future Mining, and applied all of his life experience‚Äîknowledge of the mining trade and its workers, school connections, understanding of political and legal structures, and a shrewd spirit of entrepreneurship‚Äîto his new work.

What i have learnt from Mr Motsepe's as a lawyer is that despite having studied to become a lawyer he was also keen enough to work as a business man and actually earned himself the title \"First Black Billionaire\" something I'm quite sure he wasn't aware  that it would turn out that way.  This was achieved through acquiring a number of skills to match

18/07/22, 19:42 - Unknown Unknown: In spite of the state of the economy, there are always opportunities to grow. Good business is seeing those opportunities to profit in a crisis and taking them. The current fast growing industries in Zimbabwe right as at date is the gold mining industry, web development and hosting, microfinance, business consulting among others. The industry that I'm going to major in my discussion is the gold mining industry. 

Despite being battered here and there by price and currency concerns gold still represents one of the big growth industries for Zimbabwe. The openness to artisanal miners makes entry into gold possible for the majority. The mineral remains important and the foreign currency earnings, though only 55% make it very attractive. Fidelity printers recently announced further incentives for gold producers with bonus payments so that may spur growth further in the sector.

Gold production is rising, thanks to investment into existing mines, the re-opening of two older mines by a private-Government company, a smarter system of getting the production from the small-scale mining community back into the legal fold and rising world prices making gold mining more viable.

While Fidelity Printers and Refiners, the gold buying and processing arm of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, does refine gold to very high levels it has still to get back its international recognition as a refiner that can produce gold ingots of the precise mass and purity to meet final settlements in the gold markets.

This is not a technical challenge, since Fidelity can produce the required ingots, but rather gaining the recognition back again after challenges some years ago saw Fidelity lose this needed status.

So our gold still has to go through a final stage in another country, although what we deliver to that final processor is already the required final quality.

Mining creates jobs, good jobs and a lot of jobs, but the profits tend to be concentrated, so Government policies

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

Best wishes for the new day!
Team edoofa has arranged a *webinar*  for you all, 
The webinar would be taken by *Ronard Kachage.*
Designation  at Success Magazine.

*Date  August* 
*Time  IST* 

*Takeaways from the webinar.*
The topic will be along the lines of how Mr. Kachaje went on to pursue a career in real estate by having a degree in the same field and eventually figured out his calling which was building the media brand  Magazine. One of the many benefits of starting a business or pursuing your passions when one is a bit older is that they bring all of the experience and wisdom to the table. 
The journey of Mr. Kachaje is certainly inspiring, growth-oriented, and a wonderful example for the youth of today, not only in terms of being passionate about what you believe in but also having a consistent outlook towards learning on the way and figuring things out at the same time.

He says the one thing he wishes he had known sooner was, ‚Äòsometimes when an idea is still at birth, not many will see it the way you do but you have to believe in it yourself. He also highlights that the best business decision you can ever make is hiring the right people.

Hello my Proud Edoofians, hope you are doing well. 

A well-constructed timetable establishes a natural rhythm and routine, which can be comforting students as well as their mentors. Having a plan as a learner is very important as it helps you maximize and prioritize on the things that are of urgency or importance. Most students do not have an organized study plan and if they do, they fail to follow the plan drawn. As the Wednesday Wisdom offered advice on how to use our time wisely. You must share your daily schedules with your mentors as part of your Saturday activity in the format that has been provided to you. I've given you the image of a timetable; you can draw it on paper and show it to your mentors. Do not forget to provide the scheduled time for your EWYL programme.

Happy learning and growing!

17/07/22, 03:34 - Unknown: I read your response Kudzai and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a WAY. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. We can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.
17/07/22, 04:23 - Unknown Unknown: Yes I do realize it Ma'am, if you work hard you will attain your goals

It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.

20/07/22, 15:40 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Kudzai!
How did your day go?
20/07/22, 15:43 - Unknown: Kudzai I saw you have typed 3 which means you don't know what makes you a proud edoofian.
20/07/22, 15:43 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- *‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù*
20/07/22, 15:44 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
20/07/22, 15:51 - Unknown: Kudzai in this session, I want an active discussion on our weekend activity as well as on projects, without any fail.
In case you have any doubt, we will clear it here only.

21/07/22, 05:07 - Unknown Unknown: Alright Ma'am I'm working on it
21/07/22, 07:10 - Unknown Unknown: Zimbabwe‚Äôs economy remains anchored on agriculture, despite the upheavals following the ‚Äòfast-track‚Äô land redistribution programme which started in the year 2000. Agriculture has been really effective to the economy through the growing of cash crops such as tobacco and food crops such as maize and groundnuts Agriculture is a vital sector of the Zimbabwean Economy providing employment and food production mostly. Another fast growing industry is the mining industry which takes place in different parts of the country of Zimbabwe such as Hwange where coal is mined, Unki Mine for platinum. Zimbabwe‚Äôs mining sector is highly diversified, with close to 40 different minerals.  The predominant minerals include platinum, chrome, gold, coal, and diamonds.  The country boasts the second-largest platinum deposit and high-grade chromium ores in the world. Tourism is Zimbabwe‚Äôs third largest sector after mining and agriculture and has the potential to play a significant role in Zimbabwe‚Äôs economic recovery.  Zimbabwe has a number of national parks and natural attractions and monuments such as Hwange National Park, Mana Pools, Gonarezhou National parks, Victoria Falls, lake Kariba, Chinhoyi Caves and the Great Zimbabwe National Monument.
 Tourism really does increase the development of the Economy of Zimbabwe this is because it does not have a season it happens throughout the year and also with a great income due to the increased number of monuments in Zimbabwe and some monuments are still being discovered by the government this is a great advantage to us as a country

22/07/22, 05:24 - Unknown: I read your response Kudzai and it made me so inquisitive to know more about agriculture in Zimbabwe look what I found that Zimbabwe is overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture. Agriculture accounts for 18% of Zimbabwe's GDP as of 2015. Agriculture enabled people to produce surplus food. There are different crops that farmers grow and some of these include, maize, sorghum, rapoko, groundnuts, round-nuts, and beans.
Your response reflects clarity in the way you have expressed and so thoughtfully you have penned down your thoughts.
22/07/22, 05:24 - Unknown: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.

23/07/22, 02:19 - Unknown: If I share with you the lesson now, I hope you will be able to share your understanding of the same by the end of the day.
23/07/22, 02:23 - Unknown: Wednesday Wisdom

We are back with another Wednesday wisdom. I am sure you will agree with the fact that attitude plays a major role in our day-to-day life. It is also a waste of time if the proper attitude and effective abilities are not developed. In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we discuss a crucial character quality that everyone should work on and make sure they have mastered the right attitude. Once you have read the full lesson, We will be having a discussion concerning the same in our next session. Write down if you have any questions or key observations from the lesson.
23/07/22, 04:07 - Unknown Unknown: It's been a good one how was your day

23/07/22, 05:28 - Unknown: My day went really well, thanks for asking.
23/07/22, 05:28 - Unknown Unknown: That's alright Ma'am
23/07/22, 05:30 - Unknown: I read your response Kudzai and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful: hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like, not what others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one‚Äôs goal or aim. So, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
23/07/22, 05:34 - Unknown Unknown: Thank you Ma'am I'm glad I understood it all

Rituals¬†motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending ‚Äú I am a proud Edoofian‚Äù even on Sundays!

13/07/22, 00:29 - Unknown Unknown: *Skills and personalities that student must uphold in order to be given a chance to participate in projects and earn scholarship credits*

The success of any project does not always depend on  the project manager but the team members also share the same responsibility skill wise.
As a student ,one needs to possess  or acquire essential skill inoder to grow his or her network and gain maximum scholarship credits.It is essential that a student develop his problem-solving skill it will help in solving problems that arise in complex projects.This can also be acquired by going through a variety of completed projects and see how they mitigated their issues.In order to ensure a harmonious relationship amongst the team one needs to acquire conflict resolution skill.The absence of a harmonious relationship usually gives rise to more issues.One also needs to acquire critical thinking skill in order to be able to tackle more cpmplex projects.Communication skills is also very important  so as one can know the rightfull way to negotiate with variable customers and be convincing.

How's your day going?
13/07/22, 21:16 - Unknown: I am really glad to hear your understanding of the activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY* . They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.

15/07/22, 06:38 - Unknown Unknown: *Key takeaways from Wednesday Wisdom*

The very first take away from the story of Patricw Matsope was that ones background is just in the past it dosent determine your future but your behaviour plays a bigger role in your success.He learned more by interacting with the mine workers who where buying from their splaza shop implying had he not had good communication and critical thinking skills he wouldn't have gained so much knowledge that gave him the zeal to mining. I also fully noticed one of best and most essential effect of bussiness that is the snowball effect ,he gradually grew up financially stage by stage he took his financial status to another level.

How's your day going?
15/07/22, 21:19 - Unknown: I read your response LLAN and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a way. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. With can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.
20/07/22, 14:56 - Unknown Unknown: Good morning Ms Saloni.  How are you doing today. 
The pressure of packing and getting prepared is a bit too much as I have never boarded a plane before so we are running around making sure everything is set as you also the day is just around the corner.I am also living my home for a  4 year period so I have to  be fully prepared ,I know I already have your support and the rest of the Edoofa's team.
20/07/22, 16:25 - Unknown: Good morning Allan!
How are you doing?
20/07/22, 16:25 - Unknown: I am doing absolutely fine, thanks for asking.
20/07/22, 16:31 - Unknown: I totally understand that Allan, you must be so occupied in your preparation because you will be leaving your Homeland for such a long duration, and of course, you have to make sure that you are fully prepared and loaded with all the necessities. Take your time Allan, and you always know that I am not just your mentor imparting you with knowledge and skills on a daily basis but my role is also to understand you as a friend and provide you with solutions to all your concerns and queries. 
I can understand that submitting a response at times can be difficult but I want us to stay connected every day. So I feel the best solution to it is that every day you come to the EWYL Line and follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud EDOOFIAN'. In this way, we will stay connected each day and I will be able to have quick updates on your preparation and progress. What do you think?
20/07/22, 16:56 - Unknown Unknown: Im doing good too Ms Saloni. Glad you are doing well.
20/07/22, 16:58 - Unknown Unknown: Yes, thats great Ms Saloni. Sure I will be reverting on the EWYL line daily for the ritual.
20/07/22, 16:58 - Unknown Unknown: *I am a proud Edoofian*
20/07/22, 17:00 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.

Here we have another dose of Wednesday wisdom on our most loved topic of Entrepreneurship. Yes, today‚Äôs lesson is going to talk about a sincere and passionate young female entrepreneur who has made her mark on the African Startup ecosystem. She is an award-winning UI\/UX Designer with seven years of experience working in the technology environment. We are talking about Oluwadamilola Soyombo, the founder of Skooqs. Today‚Äôs lesson will take us through the incident when Skooqs was born. I am sure a very valuable lesson is there for all of us to learn from. \u2028\u2028Also, I would like to highlight that Skooqs has partnered with Edoofa and will be working closely on providing our students with projects to work on and gain experience.  The first batch is already assigned the project. \u2028\u2028Go through the audio and pdf carefully and let me know if you have any concerns,
15/07/22, 03:09 - Unknown: WEEKEND ACTIVITY 
You must have learned how critical it is to take advantage of every opportunity. In our Wednesday Wisdom this week, we discussed a profitable business- Skooqs. Do you know that Skooqs was developed in just five days!! Thanks to Oluwadamilola Soyombo's (Founder of Skooqs), diligence and use of the opportunity. The use of the opportunity at the right time with the right skills is currently creating a significant impact on the African entrepreneurial ecosystem.  And well some of you, because of your consistency, diligence, willingness to show up for your sessions, and performance in your weekly activities have gotten this opportunity to work on a project with Skooqs. 

You are probably aware of the possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. This week, I want you to think of a few skills or practices that a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits. 
Please list the skills that are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring in a lot of learning.

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off

Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves.

I totally understand that you were occupied with some work and the network was also not favorable but I am sure that now it is and you can submit your left response on the Wednesday lesson now.

13/07/22, 02:49 - Unknown Unknown: Hello, this is my response on last week's Wednesday lesson.
Special thanks to the great African entrepreneur Oluwadamilola Soyombo, an award winning UI\/UX designer with seven years experience working in the technology industry. She found the TCK Zone which is a not-for-profit reaching out to underserved community children with no finds and training them in technology skills. Thanks to her for this great works. She and her fellows managed to form sqooks in less than 5 days after taking some challenge. Sqooks won some awards the year it was formed. A.This is a lot of great work.

How's your day going?
14/07/22, 03:07 - Unknown: I am so glad to see your understanding of being a proud EDOOFIAN.
14/07/22, 03:08 - Unknown: Secondly,  I read your response and I must say that your opinions and views reflect clarity of idea. Not just this, your simplified understanding of our young African entrepreneur, *Oluwadamilola Soyombo* assures me that you have that zeal and passion to turn your dreams and ambitions into a _big successful reality_. 
The main idea behind this is to realize that where there is a DESIRE to work hard, there is always a PATH that can take you to favorable outcomes. I know you are putting in all your efforts and I very well appreciate them, but I know you are capable to do much more than this, it is just about taking one more step ahead of others that will make you outshine in this crowd of millions of people.

How's your day going?
14/07/22, 22:18 - Unknown: From his dad‚Äôs small foray into entrepreneurship, Patrice Motsepe got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe‚Äôs success story is a remarkable one showing how curiosity, doggedness, perseverance, and the knack to exploit great opportunities as they come, can determine how successful or not, any individual could become. 
And this was all about our WEDNESDAY WISDOM.
Hope you have gone through it.
I am so excited to listen to your thoughts and views here.

15/07/22, 00:51 - Unknown Unknown: I say Patrice Motsepe has a brilliant mind. He saw how to run a business from his father and followed his father's footsteps till he became a great entrepreneur. He did very well in his mining business. It is rare to find such situations of learning business. Motsepe managed to get likings from white bosses in a Time where whites and blacks did not get along in south Africa. I have got to learn from him. His perseverance led him to where he is now. He is now a billionaire from a small entrepreneur. He is counted among the richest Africans. Wow, what a lot to learn
15/07/22, 02:57 - Unknown: Greetings Dryad!
15/07/22, 02:57 - Unknown: I read your response DRYAD and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a way. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. With can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.
15/07/22, 04:38 - Unknown Unknown: Yes that is true, when one does good we ought to copy

18/07/22, 11:05 - Unknown Unknown: There are so many industries in my country, Zimbabwe. Some I know of them and some I don't. There is food industry, textile industry, paper industry, plastic industry and many other industries. Some of these industries work hand in hand. Especially the food industry, it works with other industries since packaging materials will be required to pack the food products from the industry.
Today I'm going to talk about the textile industry. Here in Zimbabwe I view this as the most growing industry. It started very long ago but still it develops each and every second. We have so many fashion designers in Zimbabwe. The textile industry does not only work on itself but works with other industries as well just like the food industry which I mentioned above. The plastic Industry is that one I dustry which I view as the most handy industry of the textile industry. A lot of shoes have some part being plastic. Even clothes people wear they also have plastic. When we speak of plastic we do not only speak of low density polyethylene as people may think or high density polyethylene but we also speak of poly propylene and PETE. These all work to support manufacture of clothes and shoes in industry. Each and every day I see different kind of clothings . That is how I see that the textile industry in Zimbabwe is fast growing big. I also see advertisements in televisions about brand new clothes in different shops. Surely this industry, the textile industry is the fast growing and most developing industry in my country as I view it.
18/07/22, 21:20 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Dryad!

18/07/22, 21:28 - Unknown: I read your response and the way you have highlighted how multi-diverse the textile industry is, is something that caught my attention. You have highlighted very prominent factors that the textile industry has realized and used to its utmost benefit. Clothing is something that we do on a daily basis but we forget to go behind how grand this industry is, how it is using small things around us in society to its use, how they are fighting their competitors each day, how they are utilizing their strengths to their best and so on.
18/07/22, 21:29 - Unknown: I am having an amazing day Dryad, thanks for asking.
18/07/22, 21:31 - Unknown: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. *SWOT analysis* is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader. 
Also Dryad, along with the SWOT analysis of a company, I would appreciate it if you also share a *SWOT analysis of yourself*. I want to see how much more you have learned beyond this activity.
19/07/22, 03:08 - Unknown Unknown: I will first share a SWOT analysis of myself. So my strengths are time management and planning. My weakness is that I'm forgetful. I think time management is a great opportunity to use grow in business and being forgetful is a threat in business. Being my strength, time management is also an opportunity and also being forgetful is a weakness it's also a threat. I think the same SWOT analysis is also applicable to a company. Where time management and management of everything done on the company and production should be strengths. Depriving workers of their full rights could be a threat and employing experienced people is an opportunity to make the company move forward
19/07/22, 04:53 - Unknown: That is so applaudable Dryad. You know what I feel is that an individual who succeeds in recognizing their weaknesses truly comes out to be a successful person because once they know, they will surely put efforts to work. As you have mentioned that you are forgetful, I feel that with timely submission of your responses and Isaac project, you are working very hard to overcome them Dryad. I see you using your strengths to your fullest and I know you can work more consistently because you have the capabilities. Managing time is some
19/07/22, 04:54 - Unknown: *something that many managers are still figuring out to do, it good to take an early start Dryad,
19/07/22, 05:29 - Unknown Unknown: I will first share a SWOT analysis of myself. So my strengths are time management and planning. My weakness is that I'm forgetful.

21/07/22, 21:39 - Unknown: Let's move toward our session Dryad.
Successful people don‚Äôt blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our *WEDNESDAY Wisdom* was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects

21/07/22, 23:26 - Unknown Unknown: Yes it is true I have learnt not to blame the environment but rather myself if things do not work according to my plans. A wise person whether the environment is unfavorable he or she finds a way to make plans a success
21/07/22, 23:27 - Unknown Unknown: Inorder to get plans to a success I have to work hard and stay focused and having a positive mind
22/07/22, 01:38 - Unknown: I read your response Dryad and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one‚Äôs goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within
22/07/22, 01:38 - Unknown: Now we are left with our discussion on the projects.
22/07/22, 02:49 - Unknown Unknown: On Facebook and WhatsApp I didn't find people interested

12/07/22, 23:19 - Unknown Unknown: According to my research and thinking .Skills  that are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring a lot of learning  are leadership skills ,risk management skills ,problem solving skills ,effective communication skills just mentioned but a few.

Starting with leadership skills it state that  as a project owner or manager you need to be a leader that applies leadership skills to guide and motivate team members to achieve their goals . Effective communication is also another skill which need to be mastered  . You can‚Äôt be able to do a business project without effective communication or to articulate what it is you need your project team to do ,so u have a clear communication plan for your customers ,stakeholders and contractors .Problem solving is also another skill which is needed when doing a project .Having the skills to solve problems means that your project is more likely to deliver success so this need to be mastered . In addition , critical thinking is also another skill

The deadline to make the submission is *Thursday* *6 PM*. Please make sure that you submit your response before that because the *Academic Board* keeps a very strict check on these things. 
 
The aim of this activity is to make you aware of the life journey of Patrice Motsepe and how you can inculcate his traits in your daily life.

Wednesday Wisdom 
 From the pdf about Patrice Motsepe  l understand the entrepreneurship skills  that he used until he is finally successful . I understood the entrepreneur skill like being self confidence  . He didn‚Äôt never get discouraged  although he was facing many problems and failures in his life buh he keep on working hard and believing in himself until he is finally successful . The second thing l got interested from Patrice Motsepe is the sprit of keeping moving, keeping dreaming and keeping going until he‚Äôs successful .The other thing that l learnt from Mr Matsope is the sprit of pursuing passion . He said ,do things that excite you and combining it with work hard and sacrifice will make you extremely successful .

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond.

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:35 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off

Rituals¬†motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending ‚Äú I am a proud Edoofian‚Äù even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"

Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off

25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals¬†motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending ‚Äú I am a proud Edoofian‚Äù even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"
