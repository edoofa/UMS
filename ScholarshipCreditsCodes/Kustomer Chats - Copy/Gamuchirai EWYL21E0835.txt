16/07/22, 02:49 - Gamuchirai EWYL21E0835: Wednesday lesson:
One of the major things to always not in life is that winners never give up to do their best. From the lesson I learnt that no matter your background if you wish to succeed in life you should see the better you trying up to take and make a change within yourself and attain an aim to go forward doing your best and even excelling in it. Will is the greater virtual to attain greatness because laziness will only make you slacken on what you want to do and never reach your full standard potential of whom you dream to become
16/07/22, 17:52 - Unknown: I am very happy after going through your response. ?
Proud Edoofians, These are the footsteps that we have to follow. The traits that he gained and possessed are not something that could be taught in schools\/ universities. That is why our head coach, Ms. Davi, tries that through every lesson you are able to get one step closer towards gaining these traits and making your career sucessful.
16/07/22, 17:52 - Unknown: Good Morning, Proud Edoofian ?
I hope that you are in good health and spirits

We will be continuing with where we left in our scheduled session next week.
I wanted to inform you that I won't be active on the EWYL DEDICATED LINE this weekend. I have dedicated this weekend to the Edoofians who are in India. I will be getting on calls with them and checking how everything is going.

I would want you to follow the points given below:
◼️Make sure that you follow the Proud Edoofian ritual (Even on Sunday?)
◼️Keep an eye on the Saturday Activity that will be shared in your batch group
◼️Also, If you haven't submitted the Wednesday Lesson yet, Please make sure that you submit it as soon as possible.
◼️I would like to you work diligently on the EWYL Projects and submit your Project Progress Form in our next scheduled session.

I wish you a blessed and a joyful weekend ahead✨
16/07/22, 18:27 - Gamuchirai EWYL21E0835: Thank you
16/07/22, 18:27 - Gamuchirai EWYL21E0835: I am a proud edoofian
16/07/22, 18:28 - Gamuchirai EWYL21E0835: Good morning I had already sent through my response for Wednesday yesterday
16/07/22, 18:28 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
