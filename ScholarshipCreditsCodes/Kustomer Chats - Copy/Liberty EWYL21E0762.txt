12/07/22, 18:30 - Liberty EWYL21E0762: Skills
First  and fore most hardworking pays. Someone has to work hard to obtain maximum schoolarship credits in assigned tasks \/ projects. Quick decision making on the projects that are beneficial in your society is also required in choosing. Commitment is also needed. Integrity as a core skill should be implemented by a student to obtain maximum credits. Sympathy and enthusiasm skills are also needed. More communication skills in both social media platforms and in the community is also required in order to gain more followers on your task
13/07/22, 01:39 - Unknown: Hello Liberty!
How are you?
13/07/22, 01:40 - Unknown: I am really glad to hear your understanding of the activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY* . They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost up, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.
14/07/22, 08:42 - Liberty EWYL21E0762: Mr Patrice's life history is a role model to us. At first, he survived under his father's responsibilities of business Management and liked the miners who bought products at his father's shop especially on the amount they spent. So it gave him an overview that mining is of much beneficial.Although he did a degree of law, his also made his mining deal into practice and combines the two. Passion hardworking, perseverance made him to make his life a different. By now he is now a billionaire through integrity and mission based. 
Wonderful lesson for life?
15/07/22, 20:55 - Unknown: Good afternoon Liberty!
How's your day going?
19/07/22, 16:32 - Liberty EWYL21E0762: Fast growing business in Zim
There are so many projects that are improving and growing in my country such as production industries, small to medium gold mining, fish and aquaculture farming, vending business just to mention but a few. But amongst all I'm very pleased by small capital to more profits business type of car wash and service station.
In all parts of the country, this type of business is bringing income to the servers. The ever busy movement of cars, motors requires more fuel and health and hygiene. So a focused person has to take advantage of this and implement car wash. Especially in or near complex, shopping malls, busy church service center where more functions are done, a car wash area is located in Zim. Small implements if manual such as car washing liquid, dust cleaner are just needed. The lucky party of it, a person starts by 1 and end having many, just the matter needed is labour. On the other hand, service station will be providing gas, petrol per liter. Due to inflation hitting the economy, the servers would benefit a lot. Even due to power cuts of electricity, people are relying on gas stove for cooking hence emanating the abundance of service station centres
19/07/22, 22:18 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Liberty!
How's your day going?
19/07/22, 22:20 - Unknown: I read your response Liberty and you know it made me so inquisitive about the manufacturing industries in Zimbabwe look what I found  manufacturing sector has gone through a decade of de-industrialization and is currently experiencing low capacity utilization levels, low productivity levels and this has taken away the competitiveness that the local manufacturers need to compete with foreign products.
You have given a broad overview of many industries and generalized the SWOT. it is great to see your understanding of the same.
19/07/22, 22:21 - Unknown: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader. 
Also Liberty, along with the SWOT analysis of a company, I would appreciate it if you also share a SWOT analysis of yourself. I want to see how much more you have learned beyond this activity.

25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

25/07/22, 09:15 - Liberty EWYL21E0762: Thr Wednesday story about the sea and the sailor taught us a lot of lessons. We learnt that we should not blame others if we fail. To achieve, someone must be focused, determined and willingness. In life people who blame others eventually end up being loosers

11/08/22, 22:06 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
