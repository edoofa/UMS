It is the year to trust in yourself and pursue your wildest ambitions; a new year brings abundant opportunities.
04/01/23, 23:09 - Unknown: Edoofian, I would like you to know the 3 things that I want to achieve this year :
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Make sure you are able to self-finance your higher education here in India!. For that, Let us start with a smaller target of earning between $30-$50 per month and as we increase our earnings, We will keep increasing this target as well
3. And ensure that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world, workplace and help you grow holistically which we will do by judiciously making use of the lessons and activities
04/01/23, 23:09 - Unknown: Also, I wanted to inform you that we won’t be having any sessions Today.

04/01/23, 23:10 - Unknown: Since, It’s Wednesday Today, which means that it is time for our *WEDNESDAY Lesson*.

04/01/23, 23:10 - Unknown: *Wednesday Lesson | 4 Jan*

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy learning.

02/02/23, 17:25 - Unknown: You missed out on the Proud Edoofian Ritual yesterday.
May I know what happened?
02/02/23, 21:43 - Unknown: Edoofian, Punctuality in school life builds the path to success in a student's life by enabling them to plan ahead, make an efficient routine, and be prepared for their tasks. A punctual student is better equipped to deal with their day-to-day tasks than a person who leaves it for the last moment. Please note that we would only be able to earn the desired amount of credits if we are punctual at our session timings.

May I know the reason for your absence?

03/02/23, 21:31 - Unknown: I understand that, Christopher
 We have students who texted to say they had power failures and would be unable to attend class at the usual time, which is understandable. However, as soon as their power was restored, they notified me and asked what they had missed due to their absence. Isn't this exactly what a sincere student would do?
03/02/23, 21:39 - Christopher EWYL22E0417: It is
03/02/23, 22:04 - Unknown: I am sure that you will keep me informed from next time, right?

16/03/23, 05:58 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian,
This week's Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the topic of \"Seeking Wealth, not Money or Status.\" This is an important lesson that will provide valuable insights into the pursuit of financial stability and success. During this lesson, we will explore the concept of wealth and its importance in building a sustainable financial future. We will discuss the difference between wealth, money, and status, and how each of these concepts plays a role in our lives.
I encourage you to read the lesson in detail and take notes to fully understand the material. It is important to engage with this topic and think critically about your own financial goals and aspirations.
By understanding the importance of seeking wealth over money or status, you can develop a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial success. I look forward to exploring this topic with you in more detail during our upcoming lesson.

Happy learning!","transform":"
22/03/23, 22:48 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Ready for your dose of Wednesday wisdom?

I want to ask you a question: Have you Despised Wealth?

The concept of wealth has been a topic of much debate and discussion for centuries. While some view wealth as a means to achieve success and fulfillment, others may view it with suspicion or even disdain. However, it is important to understand that ethical wealth creation is possible and can be a force for good in the world. In this regard, it is essential to examine our own perspectives on wealth creation, and consider how they may impact our relationship with money, status, and success.

Read today’s lesson in detail and let's have a detailed discussion in our upcoming session. I am sure today’s lesson will lead to many fruitful discussions and will assist you in planning better for your journey towards wealth creation.","transform":"
