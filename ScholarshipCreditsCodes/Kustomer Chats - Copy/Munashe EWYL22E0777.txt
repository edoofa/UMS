20/01/23, 22:29 - Unknown: Hello Munashe, Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Line. Here we practice a 'mantra' where you should always start and end the day by saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' to boost your energy!
20/01/23, 22:31 - Munashe EWYL22E0777: Ok sir lam a proud Edoofian
20/01/23, 22:32 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

24/01/23, 00:16 - Unknown: We shall be starting from tomorrow properly, but I will be briefing you aboutit now.
24/01/23, 00:16 - Unknown: This week, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
24/01/23, 00:17 - Unknown: May I know if you have Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead tomorrow.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him\/her for your School Head’s Contact.
24/01/23, 00:18 - Munashe EWYL22E0777: Ok sir I will try my best to find it
24/01/23, 00:18 - Munashe EWYL22E0777: Ok l understand

24/01/23, 00:23 - Unknown: Yes, in fact, let me help you out as you will be carrying out this project.
24/01/23, 00:23 - Unknown: Now, Once you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering professional communication, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized. 
The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
24/01/23, 00:26 - Munashe EWYL22E0777: Yes sir  l promise

24/01/23, 20:58 - Munashe EWYL22E0777: Iam a proud Edoofian
24/01/23, 20:59 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.
