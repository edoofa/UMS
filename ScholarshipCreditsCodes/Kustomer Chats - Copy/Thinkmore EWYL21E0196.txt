Happy new week my proud Edoofian! How are you doing today?
12/07/22, 21:39 - Unknown: Thinkmore, did you work on the Weekend activity? 
It was an interesting one and related to the EWYL projects and really fascinated me.
12/07/22, 21:45 - Thinkmore EWYL21E0196: *Saturday lesson* 

For every challenging project given to Edoofians, it is an opportunity to embrace their skills and acquire new ones. So inorder for us as proud edoofians to participate in real-world projects for businesses, we should uphold certain crucial skills.

It is mandatory for students to be disciplined as discipline is very important. If they are disciplined, this means that they will be able to follow instructions and do what they're being told to do without any objections.They should be self-driven and responsible so that they will be able to work their projects whole heartedly earning maximum scholarship credits.

Time management is also important to students that is being able to make time for the projects and able to balance the projects' work and studies.

Students should be able to always believe in themselves because what the mind of man believes is what it can achieve so if they believe that they can work and earn maximum scholarship credits, they will completely achieve them but this can only be achieved if hardwork and commitment are put together into practice.

Furthermore good communication skills are also important so that the students will be able to communicate with various people.
Other skills such as problem solving and critical thinking are also expected to be within students.
12/07/22, 21:47 - Thinkmore EWYL21E0196: Yes I managed to work on the activity
12/07/22, 22:59 - Unknown: Good work on the Weekend activity Edoofian! Do you now know what from this list of skills you are executing to get selected for the projects?
12/07/22, 23:30 - Thinkmore EWYL21E0196: Yes sir
12/07/22, 23:30 - Thinkmore EWYL21E0196: Yes I know
13/07/22, 00:32 - Unknown: You see the top skills you need are the ability to be consistent and to be hardworking. Listening to the my instructions as they are to help you build your future and executing them with passion for your own success.
13/07/22, 01:54 - Thinkmore EWYL21E0196: Yes these skills are very important and I believe they'll help me to succeed
13/07/22, 02:28 - Unknown: Yes Thinkmore. That is correct. Implement the same in your projects as well.
13/07/22, 02:28 - Unknown: Did you also watch the video of the Edoofa's Africa trip that I shared along with the activity?
13/07/22, 03:27 - Thinkmore EWYL21E0196: I'll do so
13/07/22, 03:27 - Thinkmore EWYL21E0196: Not yet sir
13/07/22, 18:08 - Unknown: Hello Thinkmore! my proud edoofian! How are you? Please send the proud edoofian message for the day.
13/07/22, 18:08 - Unknown: Please also share with me updates regarding your work on the EWYL projects this week so far.
13/07/22, 21:22 - Thinkmore EWYL21E0196: I'm a proud edoofian
13/07/22, 21:24 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Greeting of the day my proud edoofian! How are you doing?
14/07/22, 23:14 - Unknown: Did you work on the Wednesday wisdom task I shared with you yesterday Thinkmore?

Personally I found it very interesting as it discussed the life and struggles of Patrice, an African Billionaire and I believe my students should take inspiration from him.
14/07/22, 23:40 - Thinkmore EWYL21E0196: Yes the story is quite interesting and aspiring. I've learnt that hardwork, perseverance and believing in yourself will make you successful. And also we should always take advantage of opportunities just like Patrice did.
14/07/22, 23:51 - Thinkmore EWYL21E0196: And also we should always never give up on our dreams, we should always keep on pushing and working hard  towards our goals
15/07/22, 00:56 - Unknown: Amazing work on the Lesson task. I saw that Patrice had the wisdom to recognize and grab the opportunities that time brought for him and that is what set him apart from others and made him who he is.

Do you agree on this Thinkmore?
15/07/22, 00:59 - Thinkmore EWYL21E0196: Yes I'm with you
15/07/22, 01:02 - Thinkmore EWYL21E0196: I have found students who want to join the Edoofa Scholarship Program sir

Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

 *The growth mindset ofsuccessful people
* 

The growth mindset of successful people should always be positive and most importantly should have discipline . Successful people should be able to take every challenge set for them as an opportunity to showcase and enhance their skills and also develop new ones. They should have an optimistic mindset that is expecting the best outcome in everything they do, be it in business or other things. In the journey to be successful, they may get knocked down many times and experience failures sometimes, but when this happens they should have a mindset  that never gives up,a mindset that thrives to achieve the best outcome, so they should always stick their chest out and handle those situations wisely. It's obvious that successful people are also leaders so their mindset should posses the skill of servant leadership which is a very good skill to acquire since it allows them to  put the needs of their employees first resulting in them being the best leaders. So for me as a proud edoofian, I'm going to believe in myself that I will work on the EWYL projects and get the maximum scholarship credits because what the mind of man believes is what it can achieve and put more effort so that I will be able to develop the same mindset as the successful people.
