Reaching out to current Form 6 students who will be starting their tertiary education next year is a thoughtful approach.

09/10/23, 14:00 - Aditi Kapoor: So, Timothy since you missed out on receiving the Saturday activity as you didn't follow your Proud Edoofian ritual.
So I am sharing it now and I expect you to submit it before 1:00 PM today.
09/10/23, 14:00 - Aditi Kapoor: As part of our Saturday activity, we have something special in store for you that's all about celebrating our Edoofian pride!

Today's activity is all about showcasing your pride as an Edoofian. We want you to flaunt your badge of honor, that feeling of being a proud Edoofian, and record a short video saying, "I am a proud Edoofian, and here's one reason why." This is your opportunity to share your Edoofian spirit and what makes you proud to be part of our community.

Reading five books a month is a fantastic way to enhance your knowledge, and the practice of taking notes and turning them into actionable steps can be very beneficial.

12/10/23, 14:21 - Timothy EWYL23E0676: I was THINKING of creating a group with the name EDOOFA with a brief background of the scholarship terms and conditions.
