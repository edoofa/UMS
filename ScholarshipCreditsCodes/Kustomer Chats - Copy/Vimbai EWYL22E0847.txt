03/05/23, 23:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Vimbai!
How are you?
03/05/23, 23:28 - Vimbai EWYL22E0847: Finally maamüôÇ, I am glad you finally reached out to me.
03/05/23, 23:29 - Vimbai EWYL22E0847: I am fine thank you, how are you?
03/05/23, 23:31 - Saloni Rastogi: I am so sorry Vimbai, so let me tell you one thing.
The EWYL Line was functioning super well for the past many years, but recently we had a major transition in our internal working on this platform and therefore the whole of April, there were many challenges and still we are working on it.
03/05/23, 23:31 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing well, thank you.
03/05/23, 23:34 - Saloni Rastogi: But now, the EWYL Line is functioning well and things are sortedüòá
03/05/23, 23:37 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
03/05/23, 23:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
03/05/23, 23:38 - Vimbai EWYL22E0847: That is okay I understand maam.
03/05/23, 23:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session will be held on TUESDAY and FRIDAY from 12:00-01:30 PM.
*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
03/05/23, 23:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
03/05/23, 23:39 - Vimbai EWYL22E0847: I am ready.
03/05/23, 23:40 - Vimbai EWYL22E0847: But maam, I do not think you are aware of my return to school the coming Sunday.
Will my sessions be paused then?
04/05/23, 14:29 - Vimbai EWYL22E0847: I am a proud Edoofian

05/05/23, 12:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Dear Proud Edoofian,

I hope you are doing well. This message serves as a gentle reminder for your Wednesday lesson. It is important to continue learning and developing your skills in order to advance in your career. Please take some time to go through the lesson, take notes on any important information, and complete the assigned tasks. Remember, investing in yourself is always a wise decision.

Happy learning!
05/05/23, 16:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your school. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
05/05/23, 16:07 - Saloni Rastogi: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because __ from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my school.

Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com and ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
05/05/23, 16:09 - Vimbai EWYL22E0847: Okay maam thank you, I will do as you say.
28/11/23, 15:47 - Vimbai EWYL22E0847: I am a proud EdoofianüôÇ
