04/01/24, 13:06 - Ananya: As we kick off our session, here's a quote to fuel our motivation: 'The only way to do great work is to love what you do.' - Steve Jobs.

Let's approach our tasks with passion and commitment, aiming for excellence in everything we undertake today! üöÄ
04/01/24, 13:33 - Takundanashe EWYL23E0357: Thank you
04/01/24, 13:38 - Ananya: Now, Takundanashe, I believe that we should begin with something that aligns with your interests. May I ask, which one is your favorite project: the community building or the African school mission?
04/01/24, 13:43 - Takundanashe EWYL23E0357: The African school mission
04/01/24, 13:44 - Ananya: Wow! So, for today, let us discuss your favorite project and understand a few tips and tricks to work on it!
04/01/24, 13:46 - Takundanashe EWYL23E0357: Sure thing
04/01/24, 14:08 - Ananya: A. *Connecting with school virtually*-
‚ñ™Ô∏è In this you would have to find the contacts of the schools through your peers, friends, neighbors, cousins, school teachers, and school heads.
‚ñ™Ô∏èThen introduce yourself to them professionally and state the purpose of connecting with them along with their available time.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share information about Edoofa that I will be providing you in order to help them understand the Program deeply and with more clarity.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share the school form with them, and if they are interested in connecting with us, then our aim should be to get the form filled.
04/01/24, 14:34 - Ananya: Well, I was expecting a timely response from your end. However, since our session time is over, let's connect in our next session. Please make an effort to be more regular during your sessions, considering it's just a one-and-a-half-hour-long session.
04/01/24, 14:57 - Takundanashe EWYL23E0357: Well noted

_Welcome to the first activity of the year!_
As part of today's Saturday activity, we invite you to share your personal experiences from any event you have attended, whether it be a seminar, workshop, or any other gathering. Our Wednesday lesson already highlighted the skills and experiences we can gain by our active participation in events that are aimed at sharing the Industry experience with young students.

Please take a moment to reflect on the event you attended, and share the key learnings, observations, and any memorable moments. Feel free to include pictures that capture the essence of the event.

For those who haven't had the chance to attend any events yet, don't worry! We encourage you to share your expectations from such gatherings. What do you hope to gain? What are your goals and aspirations when attending future events? This is a chance for you to articulate your thoughts and set intentions for your learning journey.

Remember, everyone's perspective is valuable, and by sharing our experiences, we create a supportive community that thrives on collaboration and shared knowledge. Let's make this Saturday activity a meaningful and insightful exchange of experiences and expectations. Thank you for your active participation!

Best regards,

11/01/24, 19:12 - Ananya: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you today! I have not feeling well since morning however I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only this, but we also welcomed various industrial leaders, and it went super well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

15/01/24, 13:40 - Takundanashe EWYL23E0357: Not yet I'm still in pain
15/01/24, 13:46 - Ananya: Do you wish to rest for today?
15/01/24, 13:49 - Takundanashe EWYL23E0357: I'll rest after the session
15/01/24, 13:54 - Ananya: Alright, For today, I have planned something special! Do you know about a resume or a CV?
15/01/24, 13:55 - Takundanashe EWYL23E0357: I don't know what it is. I only hear people saying about it
15/01/24, 14:07 - Ananya: Well, yesterday I was updating my little brother's resume and took help from this video. I thought to share this with you as well, as he is suggesting some really good things!

https://youtu.be/QnUI3sLZ4hc?si=HTbUElM6TNHZaPlN
15/01/24, 14:10 - Takundanashe EWYL23E0357: Now I don't have data but if I get it I'll surely watch the video
15/01/24, 14:10 - Ananya: Now, please watch this video and create a resume by our next session. As of now, let us now discuss your EWYL project. Now moving ahead I want to discuss something significant with you. You know, seeing over 400 students in this event has motivated me to work for my students even harder. I want you to be here in India and pay your fee all by yourself. For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed with a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?
15/01/24, 14:12 - Takundanashe EWYL23E0357: Yes I've taken the feedback
15/01/24, 14:13 - Ananya: Alright! Now that our session time is over, let's reconvene in our next session on Thursday! Meanwhile, don't forget to connect with the students over the weekend so that we can meet our target of connecting with at least 5 students this week!

Good luck!

As part of your Saturday Activity, I encourage each one of you to dedicate some time to journaling for just one day. Let your thoughts flow freely onto the pages, expressing your feelings, ideas, and observations. Take this opportunity to delve deep within yourself and discover what truly matters to you. Your journal can be a canvas for your dreams, fears, aspirations, and daily experiences. When sharing your journal, feel free to discuss your insights, challenges, and any personal growth you may have experienced through the process.

I believe that this activity will not only enhance your writing skills but also nurture your emotional intelligence and self-awareness. I look forward to reading and discussing your journal entries during our upcoming session. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Happy journaling!
