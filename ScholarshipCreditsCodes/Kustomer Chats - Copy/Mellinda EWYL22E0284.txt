25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

25/07/22, 19:05 - Mellinda EWYL22E0284: Growing up l used to admire educated and successful people .l vowed to become one in the future.l noticed that for one to be successful there's need for a growth mindset.One's mindset in general is defined as the Perception of achieving goals in both the the professional and personal lives .lt reflects the way an individual views and acts towards life . However a growth mindset is defined as someone who believes that they can learn and improve their basic abilities through effort and failures . People who possesses a growth mindset usually interprets failures and challenges as opportunities to grow and cultivate their talents hence making them successful.Growth mindset includes Time management, embracing discomfort,the belief that you are in control of your own ability.Therefore for me to be successful l need to develop a growth mindset.This will be through putting myself in challenging situations and being able to overcome,sorrounding myself with top talents learning from them and lastly thinking of failure as a learning opportunity.l will also keep trying until l get what l want which is being successful.
