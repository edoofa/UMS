13/03/23, 23:10 - Aditi Kapoor: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

24/03/23, 12:14 - Aditi Kapoor: Ready for your dose of Wednesday wisdom?

I want to ask you a question: Have you Despised Wealth?

The concept of wealth has been a topic of much debate and discussion for centuries. While some view wealth as a means to achieve success and fulfillment, others may view it with suspicion or even disdain. However, it is important to understand that ethical wealth creation is possible and can be a force for good in the world. In this regard, it is essential to examine our own perspectives on wealth creation and consider how they may impact our relationship with money, status, and success.

Read today’s lesson in detail and let's have a detailed discussion in our upcoming session. I am sure today’s lesson will lead to many fruitful discussions and will assist you in planning better for your journey toward wealth creation.

REMINDER Make sure to complete this activity before our tomorrow's session and submit it when I will ask for it.
WE HAVE OUR SESSION TODAY FROM 8:30 am to 10:30 am
