It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.

08/11/23, 14:35 - Flora EWYL23E0837: Oook maam
08/11/23, 14:41 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

14/11/23, 12:55 - Ananya: Good morning, Flora!
How are you? How was your Diwali? I'm excited to share that many of my students in Africa celebrated Diwali by lighting candles and writing special wishes. Did you do that candle activity as well?
14/11/23, 13:07 - Flora EWYL23E0837: I managed to wish a few peoplevl
14/11/23, 13:08 - Ananya: Lovely! Well, In our Wednesday wisdom session, we discussed the significance of Diwali. Could you share your thoughts on what you found most meaningful about Diwali? I'd love to hear your insights.
14/11/23, 13:20 - Flora EWYL23E0837: Well I've had an insight and now know that Diwali is a festival of light,in celebrating light prevailing over darkness.This festival is in recognition of the victory after conquering the enemy.
14/11/23, 13:23 - Ananya: Great! You know, we celebrated Diwali in our office as well. From decorating our office to playing some games, we had a great time!
14/11/23, 13:24 - Ananya: ,
14/11/23, 13:28 - Flora EWYL23E0837: It really looks like you had a great time Ms Ananya,I hope you enjoyed
14/11/23, 13:31 - Ananya: Indeed, Now, I believe we should start with a project that aligns with your interests. So, may I ask which one is your favorite project: the community building or the schools reform project?
14/11/23, 13:32 - Flora EWYL23E0837: The community building is my favourite
14/11/23, 13:33 - Ananya: Great, so may I inquire about your progress towards that project?
14/11/23, 13:35 - Flora EWYL23E0837: I have managed to create a group,*Flora,Ananya Mentor ...."  In this group I have added a few individuals who are interested in the Edoofa Scholarship Programme
14/11/23, 13:36 - Ananya: Lovely, have you shared the offline application forms with them?
14/11/23, 13:37 - Flora EWYL23E0837: Indeed I have shared the form
14/11/23, 13:42 - Ananya: Alright, considering your progress and efforts, I have a few more ways to find potential students for your community-building project. Would you like to hear about them?
14/11/23, 13:45 - Flora EWYL23E0837: Yes please ma'am that would be helpful
14/11/23, 13:47 - Ananya: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
14/11/23, 13:47 - Ananya: *Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
14/11/23, 13:49 - Flora EWYL23E0837: Thank you so much Ms Ananya I did not even think about it,this is helpful indeed
14/11/23, 13:53 - Ananya: You are most welcome, Flora! Now, in order to maintain a minimum credit percentage in your account and gradually escalate in terms of your credits, I want to set weekly targets for you. Are you ready for your first weekly target?
14/11/23, 13:55 - Flora EWYL23E0837: Yes Ms Ananya you can set the target for me
14/11/23, 13:57 - Ananya: I'd like you to reach out to a minimum of 5 students and collect their application forms. The deadline for this task is Friday. Does that sound acceptable to you?
14/11/23, 13:58 - Flora EWYL23E0837: Yes it is acceptable,I will try my best and work hard to meet the set target
14/11/23, 14:00 - Ananya: Great! Let's conclude today's session here. I hope you'll be able to complete your target. In our next session, we'll move forward and discuss our next project, which is the school reform project.

Will Artificial Intelligence revolutionize our world or render us obsolete? 
Link: https://www.instagram.com/p/CzoE5YbhzCM/?img_index=1 
 As we witness the remarkable progress in AI, we ponder its potential to transform our lives and simultaneously question if it will replace us
15/11/23, 13:13 - Flora EWYL23E0837: Good morning Ms Ananya
15/11/23, 16:59 - Ananya: Happy Wednesday! 🌟
Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

16/11/23, 13:57 - Flora EWYL23E0837: How are you Ms Ananya
17/11/23, 13:01 - Ananya: Good morning, Flora!
How are you doing today?
17/11/23, 13:05 - Flora EWYL23E0837: I am a proud  Edoofian
17/11/23, 13:13 - Flora EWYL23E0837: I am good how are you Ms Ananya
17/11/23, 13:19 - Ananya: Thank you for asking, i am doing good.
17/11/23, 13:20 - Flora EWYL23E0837: That.is great maam
17/11/23, 13:24 - Ananya: So, Flora have you had a chance to read your wednesday lesson about facing challenges and uncertainties, especially the part about Alex turning adversity into triumph? I'd love to hear your thoughts on how his story resonates with the idea of viewing challenges as stepping stones for growth rather than roadblocks.
17/11/23, 13:27 - Flora EWYL23E0837: From Alex's story I got an understanding that sometimes it is wise to take the challenges we face in life as part of a lesson for future use,for example Alex did not stumble down but instead it made him stronger.I also realized that even when one is uncertain the best thing to do is to give it a go,a try and see the outcome
17/11/23, 13:28 - Ananya: I completely agree with your insight from Alex's story. Taking life's challenges as valuable lessons for the future is indeed a wise approach. Alex's resilience and strength in the face of adversity are inspiring. And you're spot on about giving things a try, even in uncertainty. It's often through those experiences that we discover our own strength and potential.
17/11/23, 13:29 - Flora EWYL23E0837: Indeed as the outcome may be the best thing for you as well
17/11/23, 13:36 - Ananya: Absolutely! You know, recently we had a meeting with Angad Sir, and as a whole team, we were planning to introduce some external projects! I'm sharing this information with my students early because these external projects will be considered as valuable experience when they pursue their future dream jobs!
These projects will only be offered to students who have excelled in the EWYL journey and previous projects, as they demonstrate dedication and consistency. So, I think it's essential for us to start preparing as soon as possible. Together, we will brainstorm creative ways to maintain our positive reputation and excellent record. What are your thoughts on this?
17/11/23, 13:37 - Flora EWYL23E0837: That is amazing and I am sure it will be a wonderful and educating experience
17/11/23, 13:39 - Ananya: Indeed, last year when students came to India, only well-performing students were offered some amazing projects and had the opportunity to work with renowned brands like Sirona!
Therefore, I want you to be proactive and consistent with your EWYL projects so that you can uphold your reputation in the EWYL department. This way, when an external project comes up, your name will immediately come to mind as a top candidate. Keep up the hard work, and you'll create more opportunities for yourself in the future!
17/11/23, 13:41 - Flora EWYL23E0837: Noted,thank you for the encouragement Ms Ananya
17/11/23, 13:47 - Ananya: Now, we are preparing ourselves for some external projects. Meanwhile, to grasp this amazing opportunity, we must also work toward our EWYL projects. So do you have any plans for moving ahead with your EWYL Projects?
17/11/23, 13:55 - Flora EWYL23E0837: Yes Ma'am I have managed to secure 3 Forms from students,and also managed to secure the headmaster of Budiriro 1 High school's number however he is quite busy so I am yet to meet him in person.Also I am working towards the Cooporate Alliances project as well
17/11/23, 14:06 - Ananya: Great, Flora! This reminds me of the target we set together for you. May I ask if you have successfully achieved it or not?
17/11/23, 14:07 - Flora EWYL23E0837: Well my apologies I did not manage to meet the target
17/11/23, 14:11 - Ananya: No, Flora, you just mentioned that you managed to get 3 student applications. Have you shared them with me?
17/11/23, 14:12 - Flora EWYL23E0837: I was hoping to share them with you today itself
17/11/23, 14:15 - Ananya: You can share it with me now!

18/11/23, 16:16 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one – it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!

21/11/23, 13:05 - Ananya: Good morning, Flora!
How are you doing today?  Let us dive into our session with an amazing fact! Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. 🍯
21/11/23, 13:08 - Flora EWYL23E0837: Wow that's a fact I never knew
21/11/23, 13:09 - Flora EWYL23E0837: And I am very well how are you maam
21/11/23, 13:12 - Ananya: Thank you for asking, Flora! I am doing well.
21/11/23, 13:13 - Flora EWYL23E0837: That's wonderful Ms Ananya
21/11/23, 13:18 - Ananya: Flora, I wanted to remind you about the importance of following your EWYL ritual on a daily basis. Unfortunately, since you didn't do it on Saturday, you missed out on your weekend activity. Please make sure to prioritize it early in the morning to stay on track.
21/11/23, 13:19 - Flora EWYL23E0837: Noted maama
21/11/23, 13:26 - Ananya: So, Flora, did you manage to achieve the target we discussed last time?

21/11/23, 13:30 - Ananya: Alright, Flora, may I ask if you are facing any challenges?
21/11/23, 13:33 - Flora EWYL23E0837: No exactly ma'am,the only challenge was that most of A level students were busy with their exams.But now that they are done I am sure I can get as many forms as I can
21/11/23, 13:39 - Ananya: Great, now Flora, I want to highlight two important aspects of EWYL to you.

Number one is to be job-ready by acquiring 21st-century job skills.

Number two is to self-finance your education.

Are we on the same page?
21/11/23, 13:40 - Flora EWYL23E0837: Yes ma'am we are
21/11/23, 13:41 - Ananya: So, do you understand the intent behind our projects?
21/11/23, 13:49 - Flora EWYL23E0837: Yes I clearly understand that this project is to make me a fully equiped and skilled individual with 21st century skills
21/11/23, 13:50 - Ananya: .
21/11/23, 13:55 - Flora EWYL23E0837: Very well Noted indeed the aspect of self-financing for my education is the most important and amazing part of the EWYL programme
