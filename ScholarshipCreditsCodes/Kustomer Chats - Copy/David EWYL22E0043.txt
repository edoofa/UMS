15/07/22, 23:24 - David EWYL22E0043: The story of Patrice Motsepe is actually an inspiring one.  I see that he started small but later he was the biggest thing. All this was possible due to his Hard work and hunger for success. He is someone who saw profit when others saw loss.

16/07/22, 14:52 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

18/07/22, 23:39 - David EWYL22E0043: The fastest growing sector in Zimbabwe is the mining sector. Zimbabwe is rich in many minerals i.e. gold, diamond, tin, copper, platinum and other metallic and nonmetallic ores. The mining sector also contributes about 16% of GDP.  Mining industry has high values and bestowed with significant mineral resources available on the earth to go for. However, its overbearingly negative environmental impacts outweigh the socioeconomic benefits. Air pollution, water pollution and land degradation are common in areas where such mining is carried out. Mined materials are needed to construct roads and hospitals, to build automobiles and houses, to make computers and satellites, to generate electricity, and to provide the many other goods and services that consumers enjoy. In addition, mining is economically important to producing regions and countries. In a world of deeper mines, more complex ore bodies, rising energy costs, social and geopolitical risks, infrastructure shortages and resource nationalism, mining companies remain under exceptional pressure to control costs, heighten efficiency and improve safety performance.

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment.This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organisations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
