So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
14/12/22, 17:45 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: It's ok
14/12/22, 18:51 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings my proud edoofian,
How are you doing today?

I hope you know that you will be getting your *Wednesday lesson* today, BE READY!
Also, I would like to take an update on your progress in the projects!

As you have seen that I am putting consistent efforts so that you guys can learn and earn, I would like you to tell me about the efforts you have made so far for us to be successful as a team!
15/12/22, 17:58 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: Yes ,1
15/12/22, 19:43 - Jasmine Kaur: Rise and shine this morning edoofian,
I hope you are having a good day!
Here is the quote for today:
 I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. –Michael Jordan
15/12/22, 23:37 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: That is so true ,thank you mam and apologies for not being available
16/12/22, 19:24 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello, my proud edoofian!
Let us start your session.

I have a simple riddle for you to start with:
You can see it every day, but you cannot touch it. What is it?
16/12/22, 19:29 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: Love
16/12/22, 20:14 - Jasmine Kaur: It is the sky!
My proud edoofian with the competence and consistency you can touch the sky as well. With the right kind of determination everything is possible.
16/12/22, 20:33 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: Sure mam ,thank you
16/12/22, 21:38 - Jasmine Kaur: Edoofian, I would want to know the updates and the efforts in the projects we discussed?

Have you reached out to any schools? What did the school heads say?
Have you reached out to any other students? What is their status?
16/12/22, 22:25 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: Students are not willing to study in India
16/12/22, 22:25 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: School heads still trying to reach out to them,since it's the holidays they are difficult to reach
16/12/22, 22:33 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: Students are not willing to study in India
17/12/22, 00:00 - Jasmine Kaur: Can you share the type of communication you are using?
17/12/22, 00:01 - Jasmine Kaur: Also, we set some targets based on your report card right?
I will help you with some tips:
1. Have a plan
Set goals at the beginning of the project and note the date. Have a deadline for it as well, it is good to manage the goals. Decide at the beginning how often you are going to work on the project.
17/12/22, 00:27 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: Thank you
17/12/22, 00:27 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: Thank you
17/12/22, 01:55 - Jasmine Kaur: 2. Listen and listen
Listening in my opinion is more important than saying anything. Listen to the other person's problems and just by being there you might help the other person to think out loud and share their thoughts with you [ in reference to school headmasters and other students ].
17/12/22, 01:58 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: It's ok mam ,
17/12/22, 02:03 - Jasmine Kaur: 3. Make time
Being a hardworking person is not easy, it consumes time, not only from the meetings but you need to prepare and do some research before every meeting. Be prepared to spend some time on this.
4. Be honest
If people ask you a question and you don’t know the answer, be honest, don’t make up an answer just to show that you are never wrong.You don’t have all the answers in the world. If you don’t know the answer for a problem, look for it, or even better, look for it together with your mentor.
17/12/22, 02:04 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: Ok ,sure great way to work
17/12/22, 02:12 - Jasmine Kaur: With the above 4 listed elements you can work on the projects efficiently.
Also, now as you can see I have shared your report with and I really want you to have it in your mind whenever you work on projects, activities or lessons.
17/12/22, 05:48 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: Thank you
17/12/22, 18:55 - Jasmine Kaur: Good day my proud edoofian!
Let us continue our discussion for the day!

Also, you will be getting your Saturday activity today!
17/12/22, 18:56 - Jasmine Kaur: The first step we will take to move ahead is :

B] Lessons and activities : remember to receive your lessons on Wednesdays to build your skill set and your activities on Saturdays to use that skill set.

09/01/23, 19:45 - Jasmine Kaur: Let us start with attempting your weekend Activity : 

\"Sell me this pen.\" That might just be the best sales one-liner in history.

Over the last 10 years, I've seen many sales leaders use this question as part of their interview process to whittle out the \"can-dos\" from the \"can-nots.\" 

It's a favorite amongst sales professionals, from used car salespeople to Wall Street wolves. And for good reason — it's an exciting, accessible way to test a salesperson's fundamentals. How someone responds to those four words can tell you a lot about how — and how well — a candidate is going to perform in his\/her job. 

Let's try to respond to this prominent question as part of weekend submission. Your response must be shared in at least 150 words. The submission deadline for the same is *09\/01 time : till 3 pm today*.
I'm anticipating a highly original and creative response from your end.
09/01/23, 19:53 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: Ok mam let me sure work on that
09/01/23, 23:28 - Jasmine Kaur: Did you understand your activity?
09/01/23, 23:29 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: No mam
09/01/23, 23:47 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: Selling is one of the most important tool's that business use in order to surve and out class competition.
For  me to pursade a customer to buy my pen, i will explain the following points which we refer to as persuasive marketing strategy. Which work when you convivence a customer to buy from you rather than your competitors. The points are unique selling proposition, product life cycle and understanding the competition.
Promoting a product is most effective when you focus on one or two key differences between you and the competition. This is referred to as a \"unique selling proposition,\" according to the Entrepreneur website. The differences can be product features, or it could be filling an emotional void that the competition may not be using. For example, one cola company promotes its product based on winning taste tests, while the competition associates drinking its cola with being part of a younger generation. The product is the same, but the second company uses the unique selling proposition of making its customers appear younger in its promotions.
Unless you have invented a brand new product, there is competition lingering out in the world. Conduct plenty of research on the product your competition is offering. Evaluate how they are marketing the product by reading the company website, brochures, print, online ads and other marketing materials.

Consider how your product is the same or different from the product being offered by the competition. Seeing what marketing efforts may be working and not working for the competition can guide you in how to effectively market your own product. If you are introducing a new product to the market (such as an invention), put yourself in the shoes of potential buyers and consider what benefits the product offers them or what need it fills.
The Product Life Cycle
Products go through a life cycle. The cycle includes development, introduction, growth, maturity and decline stages. Understanding and monitori

11/01/23, 20:54 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, I understand but did you check your Saturday task?
11/01/23, 20:54 - Jasmine Kaur: Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals towards achieving this goal. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

20/01/23, 01:12 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: Wednesday wisdom;

Learnt that the key to good conversations is to ask questions. Your questions should be centred on the reply from your intercolutor. You use the information you get from the response to frame a good question. This helps you to have a productive conversation rich in information and also one shoul be a good listener. It helps to build good questions from the information you get. Another tip is to build a hierarchy in your questions.  Your questions shouls ask specific things not to bunch them all together. This helps   also in having good quality and productive conversations that do not bore your interlocutor. This should be done regardless of where he or she is as it is the most important.
20/01/23, 01:16 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0458: Another importance of asking good questions is to make your conversation more enjoyable as it occupies you both. This is a  good way to interact with peers ,mentors and others as we learn each day . This also shows how well you would be listening and putting effort in your conversation.
20/01/23, 01:20 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, edoofian.
Going forward in interviews and conferences, this will be really helpful for you.
