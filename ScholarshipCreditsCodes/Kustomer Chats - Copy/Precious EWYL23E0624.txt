25/09/23, 13:20 - Precious EWYL23E0624: 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am Precious Phiri and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Precious EWYL23E0624.
26/09/23, 13:07 - Ananya: Greetings my Proud Edoofian!
How are you today?
26/09/23, 13:16 - Precious EWYL23E0624: Am ok how are you
26/09/23, 13:18 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.
26/09/23, 13:19 - Precious EWYL23E0624: Alright thanks
26/09/23, 13:22 - Ananya: Now, I believe that we should initiate something that aligns with your interests. So, may I ask which project is your favorite project?
26/09/23, 13:25 - Precious EWYL23E0624: Based on the projects I was given  in the EWYL group
26/09/23, 13:27 - Ananya: yes!
26/09/23, 13:30 - Precious EWYL23E0624: Project 2
26/09/23, 13:31 - Ananya: That's amazing! So may I ask what is your progress in that? Do you have any idea for working on this project?
26/09/23, 13:45 - Precious EWYL23E0624: Well since that I can approach my friends it's quite easy and simple since I can easily make them understand the progress that I have with the edoofa programme
26/09/23, 13:46 - Ananya: Great! Aart from this, So for community building:
1) Keep the group updated DAILY.
2) Try reaching out to students from different schools
3) Try reaching out to teachers from your school or others and ask them to share the link to your WhatsApp group with other school teachers from different schools
4) In the group just:
-please give 'only admins' access
-just ask the students/participants to DM you to know about Edoofa and to get the form
-once they DM you, share about Edoofa with them
-Before sharing the form, ask them to get you added to their school groups
-once they do that, then only share the form with them.â€‹

26/09/23, 13:56 - Ananya: Now, I have a trick through which you can connect with more students and increase your community! Would you like to hear it?
26/09/23, 13:57 - Precious EWYL23E0624: Sure let me hear it
26/09/23, 13:58 - Ananya: Another thing you can do is:

Go to Facebook and search for "Student Communities in Zimbabwe"
Join a relevant group from the appeared results.
Share information about Edoofa and include the WhatsApp group link.
Interested individuals can join the group and connect with you.
Communicate with them and provide further details about Edoofa.

04/10/23, 13:49 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofians,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning
