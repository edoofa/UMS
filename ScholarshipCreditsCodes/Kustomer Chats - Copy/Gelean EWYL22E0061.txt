22/10/22, 21:15 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian

Hope you’re doing well. We know most of you have your exams going on since we got a lot of emails to continue after the exams. While we appreciate that students like you are taking on the responsibility to be accountable for your unavailability, we need to ensure that the emails shared have to be in the right format. 
Email writing is a skill that each professional must possess. An email should be written with the intent to share information formally with your colleagues\/seniors\/mentors etc. 
In today’s activity, we want you to write an email sharing your exam schedule and your date of rejoining the EWYL sessions. 
Also, attach your exam schedule\/date sheet as a part of the email.

For the ones who are yet to start with their exams or don’t have them ongoing, write an email addressing your mentor about what has been their contribution in shaping your career so far and one thing that you want to learn from them. Please mention specific information.

Please feel free to discuss this if you have any queries with your mentors. 
You have to email it to: deepali@edoofa.com
And cc me: anadi.edoofa@gmail.com

25/10/22, 21:59 - Aditi Kapoor: Great! Before we start your projects, can you please brief me about all the 3 types of projects we do?
25/10/22, 22:09 - Gelean EWYL22E0061: 1).Community building.

is a field of practices directed by edoofa toward the creation or enhancement of community among individuals within a regional area or with a common need or interest under edoofa.
25/10/22, 22:21 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, and the other 2?
27/10/22, 00:23 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello, My Dear Proud Edoofian.

We all know that \"History is Written by Winners\", but not everybody knows the discipline, dedication, sacrifices, time, and efforts put behind it.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the kind of mindset a winner possesses, and about the person who carved his way from the bottom to the top, and even beyond. The story of a basketball player turning into a lethal black mamba on the court, the habits he formed, and the mindset he forged, to turn into a winner, is inspirational and the most practical way to better oneself every single day. You will learn a lot of different things from this lesson, about the attitude, instinct, and character of a true all-round winner.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

28/10/22, 21:26 - Aditi Kapoor: No worries Gelean! Let me explain them to you.

1. Corporate Alliance  is the project where you shall be searching for companies online and would try to connect them with us so that we can work with them to create projects and opportunities for our edoofians, and help them get more industry exposure.

2. African Schools Reform  we at Edoofa, understand the importance of quality and affordable education, we want to spread the word and help others acquire the resources to work towards a better future. Hence, you shall be looking for schools in your areas and region, contact their headmasters\/principals, and connect them with Edoofa so that the word can be spread rapidly and in a channelized form, opening new doors and windows of opportunities for the students in Africa.
28/10/22, 21:29 - Gelean EWYL22E0061: Following sir

28/10/22, 21:55 - Aditi Kapoor: Great to hear that Gelean! But community building should not just be a project for us, but also a way of life, because, at the end of the day, that is our goal right, to give back to the community and help everyone grow to their full potential. So, I want you to keep working on the community building project and be a testimony of how every other student in your school or in your area, can also fulfill their dream of better education, or foreign education, and work towards a better future.
28/10/22, 21:56 - Aditi Kapoor: Apart from that I want you to take some time out of your schedule and work on the other 2 projects as well, where you research about companies and schools, and can help in connecting us with them.

I hope you are doing well.

\"A goal is not always meant to be reached; it often serves simply as something to aim at.\" –Bruce Lee

The above quote more or less means True success is all about working towards meaningful goals and dreams.

And this was somewhat the idea we learned and discussed in our Wednesday Lesson as well, the mindset of a winner and the habits that lead to it.

In this week's activity, you shall be putting this to use in your own working zone, by creating a list of targets\/goals, that you shall aim to achieve in a week. For a suggestion, you can start by setting up a number of Schools you would try connecting to in a week, or the number of companies you shall reach out to, or the number of fellow community mates you would tell about edoofa.

This list, you shall share this with your mentors, and they would also keep a note of it. At the end of the week, you shall discuss with them, whether or not were you able to achieve the target, and what kind of mindset change did this activity lead you to.

I hope you all will try to push your limits and aim at the sky always. This activity should be a part of habit building, which would make you a better and more organized individual and professional.

Happy Learning, and Blessed Weekend.

We all have come across the quote, \"Quitters Never Win, and Winners Never Quit\", and we also must have experienced this in our lives, directly or indirectly.

If last week's lesson, taught you the mindset of a winner, this week's lesson is going to teach you the true nature of a winner. Someone, who never gives up, or quits on the dream they see and really want to fulfill, no matter what. Moving through scorching heat, drenching rains, and heavy snow, they reach their destination and complete their journey. In this lesson, you will also learn, what happens when an entire community inherits this trait and keeps working on it. How recognition is earned and respect is gained through time, patience, and endless efforts.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

“My job is not to be easy on people. My job is to make them better.”- Steve Jobs

And till now, our founder Mr. Angad has always been a guiding light for everyone at Edoofa. And has made sure we all turn out to be future leaders in our fields, no matter how hard it seems, we should keep moving with single harmony toward our goals and motives. But, leadership can not only be taught, as it is not a literary subject, but a practical life experience that is to be taken up and practiced and bettered with each passing day.

Hence, after the very encouraging Wednesday lesson on how good leadership and patience can change the entire ideology and perception of a community to grow back from the ashes. Today's Activity is going to give you a first-hand experience to fit yourselves in a small part of the leadership shoes. I want you to create a newsletter of your own. Similar to the ones you have enjoyed reading every Sunday from the founder's office.

Your Newsletter should consider the following things:  Quotes that have been motivating you for some time now, or your three favorite quotes which motivate you to be better every day.
and,
2. One story of your idol, that can be any person, who according to you has contributed to making the community and world a better place for people to live. The story should also consist of a part stating the reason why they are your idol.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own capabilities while performing this activity.

The best newsletters of the week shall be shared with all the fellow edoofians next week.

Have a wonderful weekend ahead.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
