22/05/23, 12:29 - Lydia EWYL23E0158: Greetings Ms Saloni, I am Lydia Kasunga, and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion and my EWYL group name is Lydia EWYLE0158.
22/05/23, 17:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Lydia!
How are you?
22/05/23, 17:09 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
22/05/23, 17:11 - Lydia EWYL23E0158: I'm fine thanks, how are you?
22/05/23, 17:11 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
22/05/23, 17:12 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *12:00-01:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
22/05/23, 17:14 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing good, thank you.
22/05/23, 17:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
22/05/23, 17:23 - Lydia EWYL23E0158: Yes
22/05/23, 19:16 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know on which project will you be working on in the coming weeks?
22/05/23, 19:16 - Lydia EWYL23E0158: Schools project.
29/05/23, 16:08 - Lydia EWYL23E0158: I am a proud Edoofian.
29/05/23, 16:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
29/05/23, 16:11 - Lydia EWYL23E0158: Interesting and motivating story.
29/05/23, 16:44 - Saloni Rastogi: So, Lydia, did you perform the weekend activity test?
It was really amazing.
29/05/23, 16:45 - Lydia EWYL23E0158: Yes
29/05/23, 16:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share the result with me, like which colour badge did you get?
29/05/23, 16:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, since you chose the African School Reform project, we will be talking more about it.
29/05/23, 17:54 - Lydia EWYL23E0158: Gold.
29/05/23, 17:55 - Lydia EWYL23E0158: Yes, sure.

23/06/23, 15:24 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Edoofian,
We hope this message finds you well in your academic pursuits. We are excited to share a Saturday activity centered around learning from influential personalities. Our chosen figure is Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of Liberia and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Through her remarkable leadership and unwavering determination, she has left an indelible mark on history. Let's draw valuable lessons from her life for our personal development.

Two traits that stand out about Ellen Johnson Sirleaf are resilience and visionary leadership. These qualities can greatly contribute to our growth and development as individuals. They can positively impact our academic pursuits, relationships, and future career goals.

To develop resilience, we can learn from Sirleaf's ability to bounce back from challenges. We can seek out difficult experiences and learn from them, cultivating a mindset of perseverance and adaptability.

Here are some suggestions to help you get started:

Identify two traits: Reflect on Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's qualities that resonate with you.

Reflect on personal development: Consider how these traits can positively impact your academic pursuits, relationships, or future career goals.

Create an action plan: Outline practical steps like seeking mentorship, practicing self-discipline, engaging in community service, or pursuing relevant courses and extracurricular activities.
Let's embark on this exciting journey together and make Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's legacy an integral part of our own lives.
Best regards,

Team Edoofa
23/06/23, 15:29 - Lydia EWYL23E0158: Fine, you?

26/06/23, 16:05 - Lydia EWYL23E0158: Looking at the Saturday activity, I tried to compare Ellen Johnson's traits to mine and I discovered that mine might not be the exactly the same as hers, but they are very similar.
