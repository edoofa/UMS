Did you know that the tradition of hanging stockings by the fireplace comes from the legend of St. Nicholas? According to the story, St. Nicholas dropped gold coins down the chimney of a poor man's house, and they landed in the stockings that were hanging by the fire to dry. From then on, the tradition stuck, and now many of us hang stockings as part of our Christmas celebrations. üß¶‚ú®

But before terminating the pregnancy, Loveness's mother noticed it and made her get a pregnant test by force.

Now, 2023 is wrapping up. Don't you think we should kick off the new year with something big? How about committing to earning a specific amount of scholarship credits?

After all, you wouldn't want to head to India empty-handed.
I'm saying this from my own experience ‚Äì having some credits before you arrive in India isn't just a benefit for you; it's a help for your parents too. Not only this, we often pick students for internships and personal training based on their credits and regularity in the EWYL journey.

Believe me, you've got plenty of time right now being in your home country, so don;t you think we should utilise this time with our utmost dedication?
22/12/23, 17:03 - Delight EWYL23E094: Yes please

Not only this, I will set a target for you and you have to commit to work hard to achieve those targets. Being your mentor I will be there to help you in each process. I that alright?
22/12/23, 17:05 - Delight EWYL23E094: Yes
22/12/23, 17:41 - Ananya: Amazing! Let's set a new target for you. For the first 10 days out of the 30, I want you to focus on connecting with two schools and getting eight students to submit their offline application forms.
If you encounter any challenges during this time, reach out to me immediately because we need to achieve this target. I expect you to give it your best effort.
