10/11/22, 20:44 - Unknown: Before, We move forward, Let me share the Wednesday Lesson with you that got missed yesterday.

Wednesday Lesson

Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian,

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Deadline: Saturday 9 AM
Happy Learning.

25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

I hope you are doing well.

We really appreciate the way you have been showing in all your sessions regularly and we are so happy to see you moving ahead consistently. However, your mentor Mr. Sudeep is available due to personal reason which was unavoidable. We are very rueful about this inconvenience caused.
But nothing to worry about!
He will be available from Monday onwards and will actively take your sessions. Till then, we have been sharing with you our insightful Wednesday lessons and weekend activities. We are sure you are working on them. 

We really want that in this time you keep sharing your understanding with us on the Wednesday lesson and yes, don't forget to follow our daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line.","transform":"
