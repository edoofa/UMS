Hope you are well.

May we begin with our session‚ö°
12/12/23, 16:14 - Subilo EWYL23E0458: Yes please
12/12/23, 16:24 - Saloni Rastogi: Subilo before that, I would like to inform you that you did not receive the Saturday activity since you did not follow the daily ritual on 9th December. I would now share the activity with you and I would encourage you to work on it after the session and share the response with me by today.
12/12/23, 16:24 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!
12/12/23, 16:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Can we discuss the projects for now?

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into ‚Äì the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work ‚Äì a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.üåü

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.ü§ù
