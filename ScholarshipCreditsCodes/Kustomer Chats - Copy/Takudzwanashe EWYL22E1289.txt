Ready for today’s Wednesday Wisdom?

Have you ever wondered what the one governing principle that governs all businesses might be? What is the name of the one value that every company considers to be crucial? Have you ever heard of something called the North Star Metric?

North Star Metric is a key business metric that reflects the core value a product delivers to its customers. It's a single, actionable metric that aligns all efforts towards achieving long-term growth. Let us learn about in greater detail, read the lesson carefully and we will connect in our upcoming scheduled session. 

Till then Happy learning!

10/03/23, 23:03 - Saloni Rastogi: So let us start with the Projects we have discussed before. Can you recall what are those 3 projects as discussed before?
10/03/23, 23:15 - Takudzwanashe EWYL22E1289: Yes sir we have the cooperate alliances,the community building project and the African school reform mission
10/03/23, 23:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes! So which one would you like to start with this time? I am sure you understand the outcomes of each of the projects too.
10/03/23, 23:22 - Takudzwanashe EWYL22E1289: Yes l do understand them and l wish to start wish to start with the community building project
10/03/23, 23:55 - Saloni Rastogi: Great!
10/03/23, 23:55 - Saloni Rastogi: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME\/MENTOR NAME\/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED
For eg: a student named Tendai who formed the group on 1st February will name it-
TENDAI\/MENTOR NAME\/1FEB2023
10/03/23, 23:56 - Saloni Rastogi: Then, We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
11/03/23, 00:10 - Takudzwanashe EWYL22E1289: Ook so mentor so in the group l will also have to add you right
11/03/23, 00:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes but not this number

11/03/23, 01:00 - Saloni Rastogi: I am not seeing any group now
11/03/23, 01:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Got it I saw it now
11/03/23, 01:07 - Takudzwanashe EWYL22E1289: Ok so let me share the link with others so they can join
11/03/23, 01:09 - Saloni Rastogi: It is very important that we add the right Student (Applicant) to the group, so please make sure that you yourself add the participants and don’t forward the link of your group blindly.
11/03/23, 01:09 - Saloni Rastogi: It is done so that:
1) We have the right student, by the right student we mean that the groups should have the students who are really serious and passionate about their higher education and want to use the scholarship as a stepping stone in their career. 
2) We have the students who are known to you and or your friends who you feel that after your initial interaction with them are equally passionate like you to follow your footsteps and build your network. The other benefit being it will directly impact your scholarship credits.
11/03/23, 01:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community building project, YOU ADD ME and make me the ADMIN of the Group.
11/03/23, 01:10 - Saloni Rastogi: The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
11/03/23, 01:28 - Takudzwanashe EWYL22E1289: Understood ?✅
11/03/23, 16:01 - Takudzwanashe EWYL22E1289: Good morning mentor so if an student wishes to apply l will send them the offline application form right

11/03/23, 17:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes you will send them the form
11/03/23, 17:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Individual reach out -  you can also reach out to the students individually and discuss in detail about the Edoofa Program. You should also discuss with them about your journey right from submitting your application till you got connected with me. You can inform them about your counselor, about the interviews, admission processes, etc. and once that is done, you can ask them to fill out the Offline Application Form. One thing which you need to keep in mind is that you should only reach out to students who you feel are equally passionate and deserving like you to earn the scholarship. [preferably the ones who have completed their A-Level or are in Form 6\/Form 5]. Also, make sure that you share the correct information with the applicant while sharing the application form.

13/03/23, 22:15 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”
