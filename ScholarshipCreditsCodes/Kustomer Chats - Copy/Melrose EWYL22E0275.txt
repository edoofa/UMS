16/11/22, 19:04 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

A very Happy new year to you and your family!
It is the year to trust in yourself and pursue your wildest ambitions; a new year brings abundant opportunities.
04/01/23, 23:40 - Unknown: Yes, You are right!
Edoofian, I would like you to know the 3 things that I want to achieve this year :
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Make sure you are able to self-finance your higher education here in India!. For that, Let us start with a smaller target of earning between $30-$50 per month and as we increase our earnings, We will keep increasing this target as well
3. And ensure that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world, workplace and help you grow holistically which we will do by judiciously making use of the lessons and activities


Also, I wanted to inform you that we won’t be having any sessions Today.
I will be spending my time Today designing a new plan for us using which we can earn the number of scholarship credits that we desire.
04/01/23, 23:40 - Unknown: Since, It’s Wednesday Today, which means that it is time for our *WEDNESDAY Lesson*.
I will be sharing the lesson with you soon.

Note, There is a slight change. From now on, The deadline to submit every Wednesday Lesson will be 5 min prior to our next session so that we can discuss your response in detail during our session only.
Please let me know if you have any doubts regarding our session timings.

Also, feel free to share any queries that you have, We will be discussing them in our next session.
Have a cheerful day ahead!

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy learning.
05/01/23, 22:10 - Unknown: Greetings, Melrose
I hope that you are doing well
05/01/23, 22:10 - Unknown: Let us start with our session.
Please share your Wednesday lesson submission
I hope that you were aware that you had to submit it 5 mins before our Today's session.
06/01/23, 00:01 - Unknown: Edoofian, Punctuality in school life builds the path to success in a student's life by enabling them to plan ahead, make an efficient routine, and be prepared for their tasks. A punctual student is better equipped to deal with their day-to-day tasks than a person who leaves it for the last moment. Please note that we would only be able to earn the desired amount of credits if we are punctual at our session timings.

Before, We start with our next session, I would like you to specify the reason for your absence from Today's session by writing a letter to Ms Deepali, our Head of Department in the EWYL Group

Have a cheerful day ahead
