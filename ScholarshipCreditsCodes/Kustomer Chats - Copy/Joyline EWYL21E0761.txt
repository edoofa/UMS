25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

02/08/22, 02:34 - Joyline EWYL21E0761: Im good sir how are you
02/08/22, 02:34 - Joyline EWYL21E0761: Im not back yet sir
02/08/22, 02:42 - Unknown: I am well joyline.  Here is the activity for the week, please work on it.
02/08/22, 02:42 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofians, hope you are doing well. 

A well-constructed timetable establishes a natural rhythm and routine, which can be comforting students as well as their mentors. Having a plan as a learner is very important as it helps you maximize and prioritize on the things that are of urgency or importance. Most students do not have an organized study plan and if they do, they fail to follow the plan drawn. As the Wednesday Wisdom offered advice on how to use our time wisely. You must share your daily schedules with your mentors as part of your Saturday activity in the format that has been provided to you. I've given you the image of a timetable; you can draw it on paper and show it to your mentors. Do not forget to provide the scheduled time for your EWYL programme.

Happy learning and growing!
02/08/22, 02:47 - Joyline EWYL21E0761: Okay sir l will do that on Wednesday as  soon as l reach home

03/08/22, 02:28 - Unknown: You see, Learning to continuously put yourself in a good position is one of life's most useful lessons. While others are compelled to make a series of poor decisions, the person who finds themselves in a powerful position can profit from circumstances. Strong positions do not just happen.
03/08/22, 02:38 - Joyline EWYL21E0761: I understand sir
03/08/22, 03:12 - Unknown: Now implementing this on your daily life is more crucial.

04/08/22, 19:12 - Joyline EWYL21E0761: Good morning sir
04/08/22, 20:48 - Unknown: Joyline, Did you read the super interesting story of 19 year old Gilbert Eugene Peters from Zimbabwe that I shared with you yesterday?

I am sure you must have found his life inspiring and learnt a few things from it.
04/08/22, 21:00 - Joyline EWYL21E0761: Yes sir l did ...and l learnt that l should believe in mysef and dismiss the negativity of people's opinions inorder to my dreams come to reality
04/08/22, 22:20 - Unknown: Good to read your understanding of the lesson Joyline. The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years. The price is knowing that time is working on your side even when the results don’t show it... yet.
05/08/22, 01:51 - Joyline EWYL21E0761: I understand sir
05/08/22, 02:07 - Unknown: You see Joyline, a lack of consistency keeps ordinary people from achieving extraordinary results. Excelling at the small choices that compound over time perpetually leaves you in favorable circumstances. No matter what happens in the world, you’re never in a position where you are forced into a bad decision.
05/08/22, 02:28 - Joyline EWYL21E0761: Yess sir
05/08/22, 19:26 - Unknown: Good day Joyline, how are you doing?

05/08/22, 19:51 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

11/08/22, 22:06 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
