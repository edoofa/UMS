14/12/23, 15:36 - Ananya: Good morning, Shepherd!

Let us begin today's session with an interesting question: If you were allowed to spend a day in the life of a fictional character from any book or movie, who would it be and what adventures would you embark on?
14/12/23, 15:40 - Shepherd EWYL23E0578: Ok madam it would be a Nigerian movie that is called Short time suffer Long time pleasure and I like it because it is all about life circle that is from poverty to good life
14/12/23, 15:41 - Ananya: Alright, great!
14/12/23, 15:42 - Ananya: Well, Sheoherd, you missed your Wednesday wisdom because you did not follow your EWYL ritual on time yesterday. You know, this is impacting your overall performance. Do you wish to have a gap in your graph of achievements just because of not following the small ritual?
14/12/23, 15:43 - Shepherd EWYL23E0578: Nop ma'am I'm sorry I had not understood that one clearly but now I am .
14/12/23, 15:44 - Shepherd EWYL23E0578: I have a form to submit I don't know if it is possible to share it here
14/12/23, 15:45 - Ananya: Yes, you can do it here!

14/12/23, 15:48 - Ananya: Great job on submitting the form! I've forwarded it to our dedicated counseling team. Now, let's keep the momentum going by staying in close touch with the students and promptly addressing any questions or concerns they might have. Together, we're making a positive impact! 🌟
14/12/23, 15:48 - Shepherd EWYL23E0578: Ok ma'am thank you for your appreciation
14/12/23, 15:55 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
14/12/23, 16:06 - Shepherd EWYL23E0578: Ok madam I understand
14/12/23, 16:07 - Shepherd EWYL23E0578: I will recite daily as you said ma'am
14/12/23, 16:10 - Ananya: Alright, I want to share some amazing news you know, yesterday I was working with my students' credits! It seems like my students are back with so much excitement. I am so happy with their work—everybody is so active while working on their projects. Many of my students are earning credits, and I am sure they will return to India with a lot of credits in their accounts!
14/12/23, 16:12 - Shepherd EWYL23E0578: Waaaal that's so wonderful to know maam. I am glad to hear that
14/12/23, 16:27 - Ananya: So Shepherd, you know, 2023 is wrapping up. Don't you think we should kick off the new year with something big? How about committing to earning a specific amount of scholarship credits?

After all, you wouldn't want to head to India empty-handed.
I'm saying this from my own experience – having some credits before you arrive in India isn't just a benefit for you; it's a help for your parents too. Not only this, we often pick students for internships and personal training based on their credits and regularity in the EWYL journey.

Believe me, you've got plenty of time right now being in your home country, so don;t you think we should utilize this time with our utmost dedication?
14/12/23, 16:30 - Shepherd EWYL23E0578: I think so ma'am ok. And also I would be glad if you explain what you said about  picking students for internships
14/12/23, 16:40 - Ananya: Well, when you are here in India, we will have the opportunity to select our students as interns. The only criterion for us would be your EWYL Projects' performance, so I am suggesting that you be consistent while working on your projects.
14/12/23, 16:41 - Shepherd EWYL23E0578: Ok ok I understand ma'am thank you for explaining. I really appreciate that .
14/12/23, 16:45 - Ananya: I've finalized a few students for a 30-day challenge, and I want you to be a part of it. I need you to attend the sessions dedicatedly and put in the hard work for your EWYL projects.

Moreover, I'll set specific targets for you, and I want your commitment to work diligently to achieve them. As your mentor, I'll be there to guide and support you every step of the way. Is that alright with you?
14/12/23, 16:48 - Shepherd EWYL23E0578: Yes ma'am that's alright. The online projects I am still trying to work on it and I am trying to create another Google account because I changed the phone but I am alright with that ma'am I will be glad to have you helping me
14/12/23, 16:54 - Ananya: Amazing! Let's set a new target for you. For the first 10 days out of the 30, I want you to focus on connecting with two schools and getting eight students to submit their offline application forms.

If you encounter any challenges during this time, reach out to me immediately because we need to achieve this target. I expect you to give it your best effort.
14/12/23, 16:56 - Shepherd EWYL23E0578: Ok ma'am that's great so when are these days starting
14/12/23, 16:57 - Ananya: Tomorrow!
14/12/23, 16:58 - Shepherd EWYL23E0578: Ok ma'am I will try all my best and put all my efforts
15/12/23, 15:31 - Shepherd EWYL23E0578: I am a proud edoofian.
15/12/23, 15:31 - Ananya: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

18/12/23, 16:35 - Shepherd EWYL23E0578: Good morning Mrs Ananya. There was a heavy storm with lightning and thunder hence I failed to connect with you on time
18/12/23, 16:36 - Ananya: Is it better now?
18/12/23, 16:41 - Shepherd EWYL23E0578: Yes ma'am
18/12/23, 16:46 - Ananya: During our last session, I set a small target for you. I'm eager to know how far you've come with it. Have you encountered any challenges along the way? Let me know, and we can work through them together.
18/12/23, 16:52 - Shepherd EWYL23E0578: Ok ma'am I am glad to let you know that I have found six forms right now and the connection with heardmasters is still challenging me on that they are not usually found online platforms but only WhatsApp because hear in Zimbabwe the platforms are not usually used by the heards...they usually use WhatsApp. I send a message to the head of my own school but it seemed like he is busy with the marking these days because he did not respond for now but I hope he will respond. I am also searching for other contact numbers of different heads and I hope I will find them maam

28/12/23, 16:18 - Shepherd EWYL23E0578: A story related to Christmas and new year.

In our lives, there are so many different holidays and special days on our calendars but there are the most celebrated holidays that are very special to everybody. There is no one who wants to miss those days, Christmas and New year.  The importance of these days may be observed on the days towards the end of November when people will be preparing for them.

It was on the 24th day of December while our family was very broke to a great extend. There was no one who had prepared for the Christmas and new year. No one had new clothes ☹️ to wear on the same following days. Everyone was sad at our home and no one was wondering what was going to come next.
 
Then it was just like a mystery that took place on the afternoon of the same day. We saw a white  Fortuner car arriving at our home. It parked carefully and from there came out my brother one of my father's sons. We were all speachless. The whole family ran to meet him and we all hugged him with great joy. He had brought the joys of Christmas and new year to our family.

He brought everyone nice clothes for the Christmas and new year. If we talk about food, different kinds of delicious foods were brought and the days were about to spent well.

We enjoyed our Christmas and new year days very Happy as a family and that's how we came through the special days of the calendar at our home.
