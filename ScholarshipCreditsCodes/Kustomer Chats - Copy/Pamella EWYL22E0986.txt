Among them are air and water pollution, hazardous waste disposal unsafe pesticides, automobile emissions, ozone depletion, and global warming.

Causes

05/05/23, 12:58 - Pamella EWYL22E0986: For Wednesday lesson I understand to think better the skill you have never been taught .No skill is more valuable and harder to come by than the ability to critically think through the problems.lf you can think through things better than others, you will have fewer problems and more free time .lf you can't you are going to spend a lot of time fixing your mistakes .Good decisions make the future easier, bad ones make the future harder.l also understand about how to think.You do your best thinking by slowing down and concentrating.The best way to improve your ability to think is to spend large chunks of time thinking .lmmersing ourselves in the problem offers insights that can't be gained otherwise.One way to force yourself to slow down and think is to write.Good writing requires good thinking. One heuristic to tell how good someone is at making decisions  is how much time they have.Bad decisions accumulate , making your position increasingly worse .When you are in a bad position ,you need just the right piece to clear the board.When you are in a good position  it doesn't matter what comes next.Good decision makers understand a simple  truth: You can't make good decisions without good thinking , and good thinking requires .You can pay the price now or later.The time to get it is less than the time to correct the mistake.Good thinking is expensive.Bad thinking costs a fortune.Rather than accept that good thinking requires time, most people try to bargain with reality . Unfortunately that is not how the world works.lf you want to think better, schedule time to write out your thoughts.

What do you understand by a good decision and a bad decision?

A good decision-maker chooses actions that give the best outcome for themselves and others. They enter into the decision-making process with an open mind and do not let their own biases sway them. They make decisions rationally, after researching alternatives and understanding the consequences.


Related questions
What is the definition of bad decision-making?
Selecting the wrong answer on a test is a mistake; not studying for that test is a bad decision. The mistake was something you did without intention; the bad decision was made intentionally—often without regard for the consequence. It's easy to dismiss your bad decisions by reclassifying them as mistakes.

The factors influencing decision-making are personality, culture, context, information available, and level of education. These factors should be kept in mind whenever a person is taking any decision, as some of them can be controlled but not all, like personality or culture.

How do you know you have made good or bad choice?

A decision is of high quality to the extent that the decision maker knows what risks they are taking by making that decision. They know how good or bad their information is and the biases inherent in their reasoning. A good decision is one in which you know what you do not know.

When making bad decisions you will have bad gut feeling , exhaustion , staying quiet , intense emotions, lying , moving too fast and bottom line .

When l was in O level l was l asked with my parents whether l choose to go for extra lessons or to go for a holiday since we were in lockdown.l decided to take a decision of going on holiday without thinking and l thought since we were affected by covid 19 we will write our final examinations next year not knowing that l chose a bad decision. I relaxed with my academics  for the  whole lockdown  until one day we were surprised to hear that we were going to write our examinations under  covid 19 rules and regulations. I start think of mathematics syllabus and noticed that l waste  time on lockdown whilst l was behind with the syllabus and my friends were now ahead of syllabus. At last l failed mathematics that's l realized that l have made a bad decision and come out with poor bad results and that subject was the major subject .From this situation l learnt that  you can't made good decisions without enough good thinking and good thinking is expensive and it requires time .l also learnt that if you want good decisions and to think better , schedule time to write out your thoughts.This experience shaped and improve my decision making process in my future.

06/03/23, 17:31 - Aditi Kapoor: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

16/03/23, 17:54 - Pamella EWYL22E0986: I am done ,,,in this exciting topic l understand that  seeking wealth not money or status can provide a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial stability and success.Weath is having assets that earn while you sleep and this means that the value of your assets continues to grow even when you are not actively working or earning money.The key to building wealth is to focus in creating assets that generates passive income meaning investing in things like rental properties,stocks and businesses that have the potential to generate income without requiring your active involvement, this can create a steady stream of income that can support you and your family for years to come.Money is simply a tool that we use to transfer time and wealth.Money should not be the sole focus of your financial pursuits, it should be seen as a tool to help you achieve your financial goals. Status is your place in the social hierarchy ,it is often associated with wealth and money bt status is not a measure of true success or happiness, while it is natural to want to be respected and admired by others ,it is important to recognize that true happiness comes from within not from external validations.The main point is focus on building wealth and creating a life that brings you joy and fulfillment .
16/03/23, 18:13 - Aditi Kapoor: Good Morning Pamella.
I am glad to see you on time for the session.
16/03/23, 18:14 - Pamella EWYL22E0986: Thank you
16/03/23, 18:14 - Aditi Kapoor: Great job, Pamella, on summarizing the main points of the topic so well! You have demonstrated a clear understanding of the importance of building wealth as a means of achieving long-term financial stability and success.
16/03/23, 18:14 - Aditi Kapoor: I appreciate your emphasis on the fact that wealth is not solely about money or status, but rather about creating assets that can generate passive income and support you and your family for years to come. You are absolutely right that money is simply a tool that can help us achieve our financial goals, and that status should not be the sole measure of success or happiness.
16/03/23, 18:14 - Aditi Kapoor: Overall, your response highlights the importance of focusing on creating a fulfilling life rather than simply accumulating wealth. I hope you continue to apply these valuable insights as you navigate your personal and financial journey.
16/03/23, 18:15 - Pamella EWYL22E0986: Yes thank you
