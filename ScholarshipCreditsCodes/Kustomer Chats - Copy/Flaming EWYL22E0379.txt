24/08/22, 23:53 - Unknown: The Wednesday Wisdom Lesson this week will focus on three business success stories that went from rags to riches. Additionally, social learning is a very effective method of learning. You can learn from the mistakes and accomplishments of others, so you don't have to figure everything out on your own, for instance.

Your mentors will have a thorough discussion in our forthcoming session about what you think were the factors that led to the success of the three panellists listed here after you have carefully listened to the audio file and read the PDF.

Happy learning!
