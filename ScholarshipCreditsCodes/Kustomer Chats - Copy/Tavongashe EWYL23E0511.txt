Hope you are well.
Please accept my apologies for not being able to connect with you today. I was engaged in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

Considering that more than half of our scheduled time has already passed, I believe it would be wise to reschedule our session for the next available slot.
In the meantime, I am giving you a tas that first off you have to share your project updates as usual.
Now, there is a little extra task for you to set financial goals for each month to cover your tuition expenses. I encourage you to invest your free time in planning out this month's work on projects. I wish you the best of luck, and I look forward to receiving your prepared plan by our next session. Good luck!

_Welcome to the first activity of the year!_
As part of today's Saturday activity, we invite you to share your personal experiences from any event you have attended, whether it be a seminar, workshop, or any other gathering. Our Wednesday lesson already highlighted the skills and experiences we can gain by our active participation in events that are aimed at sharing the Industry experience with young students.

Please take a moment to reflect on the event you attended, and share the key learnings, observations, and any memorable moments. Feel free to include pictures that capture the essence of the event.

For those who haven't had the chance to attend any events yet, don't worry! We encourage you to share your expectations from such gatherings. What do you hope to gain? What are your goals and aspirations when attending future events? This is a chance for you to articulate your thoughts and set intentions for your learning journey.

Remember, everyone's perspective is valuable, and by sharing our experiences, we create a supportive community that thrives on collaboration and shared knowledge. Let's make this Saturday activity a meaningful and insightful exchange of experiences and expectations. Thank you for your active participation!
