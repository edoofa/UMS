I hope you are doing well.
SWOT analysis might sound something complex but I am sure that while going through our weekend activity, you might have gone through what a SWOT means thoroughly and gained much knowledge on the same. The weekend activity asked us to draw a SWOT analysis of any company.
I want to share your response with me here Panashe.
18/07/22, 21:52 - Unknown: Also Panashe, you have not followed the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL Line on a daily basis. Please do that without any reminders from my side. You are one of my bright and dedicated students, I give your example to other students and I don't want any lag from your side in the near future.
18/07/22, 23:10 - Panashe EWYL21E0550: Noted ma'am.

25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

01/08/22, 17:56 - Unknown: Hello my proud EDOOFIAN!⭐
How did your weekend go?
I know we both have been connected in the EWYL Journey for a long time now. I know how dedicatedly and consistently you work and make every session's discussion very productive and interactive. 
This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days:

SESSIONS' DAYS- I know you are very well aware that your sessions are scheduled on MONDAY and THURSDAY on the EWYL Line.

MISSED SESSION- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday.In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday  EWYL Line.

If you cannot attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
Keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line.

Hoping for an amazing week with you.?
01/08/22, 18:50 - Panashe EWYL21E0550: I am a proud Edoofian
01/08/22, 18:51 - Panashe EWYL21E0550: Thank you ma'am.
01/08/22, 18:52 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

How's your day going?
03/08/22, 19:34 - Unknown: Panashe the SKOOQS project was something that required immediate attention as well as a quick response but I feel you are having severe connectivity issues and later you went to your rural place too. Don't worry Panashe that's completely all right. I understand there are many such situations and I could completely relate to the difficulty that you might be facing. For now, I want you to focus on the EWYL sessions that you have where we discuss our Wednesday lesson, weekend activity, newsletter, and our ongoing three projects. I know you are a very bright kid and I have so many upcoming projects in the coming weeks. Till then put all your focus on your ongoing EWYL sessions that are held on the EWYL LINE every MONDAY AND THURSDAY.

Today's Wednesday lesson is providing us with the details of how a 19year old started his journey of a successful business and today has a majority market share in Zimbabwe, handling brand portfolios worth over $870 million. After you have read the pdf carefully share your major takeaways and the inspiration you got from Gilbert Eugene Peters. 

Happy learning!

How's your day going?
04/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Our *Wednesday Wisdom* talked about _Gilbert Eugene Peters_, a young Zimbabwean who is the CEO and Founder of Spidex Media, an advertising and media company. He has comprehensive experience in areas such as interactive print, packaging, copywriting, and design. He says the one thing he wishes he had known sooner was, ‘that sometimes when an idea is still at birth, not many will see it the way you do but you have to believe in it yourself. He also highlights that the best business decision you can ever make is hiring the right people.
So in our session today, we will discuss:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. progress on the community building project
05/08/22, 23:19 - Panashe EWYL21E0550: Well i understood that you have to push harder in whatever you believe in. 
Start small and follow your passion to achieve whatever you want. 
And also it doesn't matter where you come from. You simply have to make the best of opportunities that come your way . 
When pursuing a dream or a goal you dont have to listen to what others may say but however you just have to keep yourself focused on the goal and make sure you achieve the best

06/08/22, 02:42 - Panashe EWYL21E0550: Hello ma'am. Sorry i couldn't join
The message just got delivered now
06/08/22, 22:48 - Unknown: Greetings Panashe!
How's your day going?
06/08/22, 22:50 - Unknown: Reading your response Panashe filled me with so much fire, passion, and motivation. It got reminded me of one quote:
“If you want to be happy the whole life, tie it to a goal, not people or objects.”

This was the quotation given by Alert Einstein and the quote which gives the definition of a goal.
Through this lesson, my main motive was to teach you that sacrifices are required to achieve the main target, and achievement of those important aims is necessary.
Those aims are:
1. Analysis of my strength and weaknesses – because this analysis will let me know that how to work on both to make my strength more powerful and convert my weakness into my strength.
2. To be a good person and love yourself – To get positive vibes one should work on herself\/himself because “when you see yourself clearly, with eyes full of love and acceptance, you hold space for others to meet you at your highest self “(by Karly Ryan).
3. Never regret any past decision – “Every bad decision gives you a lesson and this makes one’s vision more clear towards the achievement of its goal” as it is said by a great personality that takes responsibility and initiative for yourself stop blaming your circumstances for what you can change.
4. Always give 100% – there is a frame on my living room wall, of Swami Vivekananda that always gives me motivation the quotation written in it says “Arise, awake, and do not stop until the goal is reached”.
06/08/22, 22:51 - Unknown: I would like to share something about my goals.
My goals also consist of making my parents proud of their daughter, a daughter that will give them a more comfortable life, one that is not filled with such pain. Indeed, I cannot deny that truly I am not experienced as much as some people, but at least for me, every milestone in my life is an emblem of my growth. When I can complete something new successfully or learn something from my failure instead of complaining, I think I have grown up.
06/08/22, 22:51 - Unknown: No worries Panashe, let me share a glimpse of students' intake on the webinar.
07/08/22, 04:40 - Panashe EWYL21E0550: My day is well. I hope you are okay ma'am
07/08/22, 04:41 - Panashe EWYL21E0550: Thank you for sharing with me ma'am.

11/08/22, 22:07 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
