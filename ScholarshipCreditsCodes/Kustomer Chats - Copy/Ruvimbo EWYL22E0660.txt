20/03/23, 17:42 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian!

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!","transform":"

27/03/23, 23:37 - Unknown: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

24/04/23, 14:14 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, ready for a motivational monday?

In a remote village, there lives a hardworking farmer who owns a farm. Over the years his grapery yields rich crops, and the farmer is very successful. He has three sons, who are young and energetic but never worry about working. As the farmer grows older, he begins to worry about his sons’ future.

Then he becomes very ill and feels that his death is coming soon. He calls his sons and says,

“Dear sons, I see my death approaching, but I want to share a secret before you all leave. These areas have treasure hidden inside. Dig the whole area after my death, to find it. ”

The old farmer died. The sons start digging for money without leaving any part of the field but nothing is found. In any case, digging their fields leads to healthier crops and results in higher incomes. These earnings make the sons realize what their father means.

What according to you is the moral of the story?

a. Hard work always pays off. The fruits of hard work are always sweet.
b. Be Selflessly kind
