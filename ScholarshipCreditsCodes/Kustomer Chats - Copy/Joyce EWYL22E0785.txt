How are you?
01/02/23, 01:24 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
01/02/23, 01:24 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.


If you are ready then we can begin?
01/02/23, 01:24 - Saloni Rastogi: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

13/02/23, 05:26 - Joyce EWYL22E0785: I am a proud Edoofian
Hello maam how are you
13/02/23, 05:28 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian, Let me share a small story with you!                                                                                                                                                                                       Ready??                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

27/03/23, 21:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

28/03/23, 19:06 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing great, thank you.
28/03/23, 19:07 - Saloni Rastogi: But, I believe the sign of a proud edoofian is that they inform about their absence beforehand so that their mentor can plan the sessions accordingly right?
28/03/23, 19:07 - Joyce EWYL22E0785: Ok maam lm really sorry
28/03/23, 19:10 - Saloni Rastogi: No worries Joyce, we can begin with our sessions now but I hope you will be available from today onwards right?
28/03/23, 19:11 - Joyce EWYL22E0785: Yes maam
28/03/23, 19:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's begin with our sessions from today as promised.
But let me inform you that I will not be available from Wednesday to Saturday since the entire team of EWYL is visiting our proud Indian Edoofian at the campuses.
28/03/23, 19:27 - Saloni Rastogi: I know we have both been connected in the EWYL Journey for a long time now and I very well know how dedicatedly and consistently you work and make every session's discussion very productive and interactive. 
This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday. 

1) Your sessions will be held on the *EWYL Line.*
2) In a session, we discuss your:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Along with this, I would like to inform you that the _purpose of EWYL Group is for tracking your progress and important notifications, not for response submissions._
4) *Every day you have to come on the EWYL Line and follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'*.?️
5) In cases where you are not able to attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
28/03/23, 19:27 - Saloni Rastogi: This plan will be followed from next week onwards.
28/03/23, 19:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Till that time, can you share on which project will you work in the month of April?
28/03/23, 19:55 - Joyce EWYL22E0785: Yess maam
28/03/23, 21:42 - Saloni Rastogi: I would wish that we work on the African School Reform project for the coming weeks. What do you think?
29/03/23, 00:23 - Joyce EWYL22E0785: Yess maam we can work on it
29/03/23, 00:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for the delayed response, I was occupied in an internal meeting with the team with was to be attended as a priority about our visit starting tomorrow till Saturday.
As informed, no sessions will be held during this time and we will begin afresh from next week onwards where I will be sharing some crazy and interesting insights with you.
But this will only be done, we you will NOT MISS these *THREE THINGS*:
1) Timely submission of the Wednesday lesson and weekend activity
2) Daily following the ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', the absence of which can lead to not sharing of weekly lessons and activities with you
3) and most importantly, *PROGRESS ON PROJECTS*

I will be tracking the progress on _Monday_.
I completely know that these two weeks, we might not have dedicated discussions on the projects. So in my absence, I want that you think in-depth about *the project you are doing, revising the targets for the same, and completing it*.
I would really be emotional and happy that in a few months, many of the new edoofians will be joining our Indian family here. And honestly, I will be happier that we start preparing now for the future because growth is not measured in one day. We need to work hard consistently and dedicatedly.

Like I always say ‘1 step daily means 1 step UP. 0 step daily means 1 step DOWN’.
I trust you, just believe in yourself.
