11/01/23, 19:37 - Progress EWYL22E0448: We grew up, our entire lives, using cheap eversharp pens because they get the job done for grocery \r
lists and directions. But we never gave it much thought to learn what’s best for more important \r
events.\r
This is the pen for more important events. This is the tool you use to get deals done. Think of it \r
as a symbol for taking your company to the next level. Because when you begin using the right \r
tool, you are in a more productive state of mind, and you begin to sign more new customer \r
contracts.\r
Actually. You know what? Just this week I shipped ten new boxes of these pens .
Unfortunately, So, I suggest \r
you get this one. Try it out. If you’re not happy with it, I will personally come back next week to \r
pick it up. And it won’t cost you a dime.\r
