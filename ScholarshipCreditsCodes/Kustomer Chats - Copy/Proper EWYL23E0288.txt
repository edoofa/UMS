14/07/23, 15:36 - Ananya: Greetings, My proud Edoofian!
How are you today?
14/07/23, 15:39 - Proper EWYL23E0288: Im doing good and you
14/07/23, 15:43 - Ananya: Thank you for asking, I am doing good. So may I ask if you were able to  read your wednesday lesson?

14/07/23, 16:04 - Proper EWYL23E0288: Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google .He is a good example of an individual who has risen from humble beginnings  to become one of the most influential figures in the tech industry. His story serves as a beacon  of hope for students around the world.
 Sundar was appointed the Senior Vice President of Android, Google's mobile operating system. Under his leadership, Android witnessed exponential growth, becoming the most widely used mobile OS in the world. Becoming CEO of google Sundar Pichai's exceptional contributions and remarkable leardership qualities did not go unnoticed.

His journey also exemplifies the power of determination and  perseverance. This story also teachs us that for we to meet our goals there are obstacles and challenges we come across with. Students can learn to embrace innovation, be open to change and develop a mindset of continuous improvement.
14/07/23, 16:09 - Ananya: I completely agree with you on the valuable lessons we can learn from Sundar Pichai's journey. His commitment to education and intellectual curiosity is truly inspiring. Continuous learning is indeed essential for personal and professional growth, and embracing education helps us stay curious and open to new ideas.
14/07/23, 16:10 - Proper EWYL23E0288: That's true
14/07/23, 16:21 - Ananya: So, Proper I am glad that you were able to complete the your target!
14/07/23, 16:22 - Ananya: Just like this, one of my students initiated and made a little effort daily.
14/07/23, 16:22 - Ananya: This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success
‚ñ™Ô∏èVisiting schools physically can put a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, leadership quality, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear to present himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.
14/07/23, 16:23 - Ananya: .
14/07/23, 16:24 - Proper EWYL23E0288: That is great

How are you
15/07/23, 17:12 - Proper EWYL23E0288: [15/07, 1:36 pm] üî•Jascoh‚úåÔ∏èüî•: Strive Masiyiwa (born 29 January 1961) is a London-based Zimbabwean billionaire businessman and philanthropist. He is the founder and executive chairman of international technology groups Econet Global and Cassava Technologies.
 After working briefly as a telecoms engineer for the state-owned telephone company, he quit his job and set up his own company with the equivalent of US$75. Strive Masiyiwa overcame protracted government opposition to launch mobile phone network Econet Wireless Zimbabwe in his country of birth in 1998.
Econet was created in 1993 in Zimbabwe by Strive Masiyiwa. Initially it was meant to be called "Enhanced Communications Network" but was later abbreviated to Econet. In 1998, Econet was granted a telephony licence, at a time when 70% of the country inhabitants had never heard a ringtone. Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning. How students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know. Students' motivation determines, directs, and sustains what they do to learn. Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances quality of students' learning.
 When students can direct their learning and know how they learn best, they can also better navigate the wide range of available choices in school and beyond. Learning to learn is particularly important when teachers are no longer a main source of information and knowledge.

Its time for our Saturday Activity, I want you to delve into the realm of inspiration and write a detailed essay about a person whom you know personally and who embodies the remarkable trait of consistency. This individual has consistently demonstrated their dedication, determination, and unwavering commitment, becoming a true source of inspiration for you.

In your essay, please explore the key aspects of their life, experiences, and actions that exemplify their consistent nature. Describe how their consistent approach has positively influenced and impacted not only their own life but also the lives of those around them. Reflect on specific instances or situations where their consistent behavior or mindset has motivated you to strive for excellence or overcome challenges in your own life.

Feel free to include personal anecdotes, observations, or conversations that highlight the impact this person's consistency has had on your growth and development. Additionally, analyze the qualities, values, or strategies that you believe contribute to their ability to maintain consistency over time.
I am excited to read your insightful essays and learn about the inspiring individuals who have demonstrated the power of consistency.
