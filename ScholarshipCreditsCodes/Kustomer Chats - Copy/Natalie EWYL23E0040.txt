28/12/23, 15:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day,
How are you?

In our session for today we will discuss:
1. Understanding of the Wednesday lesson that was shared with you yesterday
2. Projects progress made so far
28/12/23, 15:52 - Natalie EWYL23E0040: Yesterday‚Äôs lesson was sharing light of how it is important to have community building as it brings people together. Through social media ,we meet multitalented youths who are willing and keen on creating a bright future. It also enhances skills for students as they get to interact with different people. It is also an advantage as a student gets scholarship credits.
28/12/23, 16:09 - Saloni Rastogi: Thanks for highlighting the importance of community building in yesterday's lesson. It shed light on how it brings people together, especially through social media, connecting multitalented youths with a shared vision for a brighter future. The interaction fosters skill enhancement for students, and the potential for scholarship credits adds another valuable dimension to the benefits. Appreciate your insights!

28/12/23, 16:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Yesterday, I shared an audio for the community building project, can you share with me what have you understood from it?
28/12/23, 16:28 - Natalie EWYL23E0040: That it‚Äôs all about getting students who want to further their studies and introduce them to Edoofa. By doing so one can earn scholarship credits too. It also creates opportunities for children across Africa not my country alone
28/12/23, 16:46 - Saloni Rastogi: That is amazing, you have got it well!

So can you think of ways on you can do that?
28/12/23, 16:58 - Natalie EWYL23E0040: Okay
28/12/23, 17:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Starting from the new year, we are embarking on a new phase to enhance project performance. As the first project is currently on hold due to internal development, our attention will be dedicated to the Community Building Project and the African School Project.
We will be working diligently on these initiatives because, in just a few days, you will be only a few months behind your intake. Our primary focus will shift towards achieving a financial milestone of earning $1000-2000 before that deadline. Are you on board for this journey?
