08/06/23, 17:30 - Ananya: I am good too! You have done a great job! I can see you company forms.

08/06/23, 17:46 - Phillip EWYL23E0206: Mm l don't quite remember.
08/06/23, 17:46 - Ananya: Alright, before that, may I know if you were able to read the Wednesday lesson?
08/06/23, 17:47 - Phillip EWYL23E0206: Yes l was able  to
08/06/23, 17:48 - Ananya: So what are your thoughts about that?
08/06/23, 17:52 - Phillip EWYL23E0206: learning  skills, lessons,
and experiences that aren't on the syllabus, to become more creative, and truly discover our
true selves. Most importantly, to develop useful skills that will aid in my journey to
becoming successful professionals.
When it comesto networking and building relationships with people,
08/06/23, 17:54 - Ananya: When it comes to networking and building relationships with people, I wholeheartedly agree that it goes beyond what is taught in the syllabus. It involves acquiring valuable skills, learning from various experiences, and exploring our creativity to truly discover our authentic selves. These aspects are crucial in our journey towards becoming successful professionals. Networking allows us to connect with others, exchange knowledge, and build mutually beneficial relationships. It opens doors to opportunities and helps us expand our horizons. So, let's embrace the process of developing these essential skills and fostering meaningful connections with others.
08/06/23, 17:55 - Phillip EWYL23E0206: Yes Network truly  creates opportunity to community building also ..
08/06/23, 17:58 - Ananya: Absolutely! Well, for you I have a favorite part of the Wednesday lesson: Pivot Strategically: The ability to pivot and adapt to new circumstances is crucial in an ever-changing world. The authors explain how to recognize when it's time to make a career pivot and provide insights into managing transitions effectively. They emphasize the importance of maintaining a growth mindset and being proactive in shaping your own future.
08/06/23, 18:02 - Phillip EWYL23E0206: Okay so meaning in order to adapt to to new circumstances in critical in an ever changing world there got to be skills and creativity
08/06/23, 18:10 - Ananya: I want to highlight the importance of this because as you prepare to leave your home and embark on your new journey in India, you may encounter various challenges. However, it is essential to adapt to these new circumstances in order to foster personal growth. Embracing change and being open to new experiences will not only help you navigate the challenges but also provide opportunities for growth and development. Therefore, it's crucial to be adaptable and embrace the changes that come your way as you embark on this new chapter of your life in India.
08/06/23, 18:11 - Phillip EWYL23E0206: Yes noted
08/06/23, 18:15 - Ananya: Great, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students in project two!
08/06/23, 18:16 - Phillip EWYL23E0206: Okay please
08/06/23, 18:19 - Ananya: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: Youâ€™re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
08/06/23, 18:19 - Ananya: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
08/06/23, 18:19 - Ananya: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
08/06/23, 18:20 - Ananya: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
08/06/23, 18:25 - Phillip EWYL23E0206: Okay so l am supposed to creat three groups
08/06/23, 18:26 - Ananya: No, dear it is just a single group.2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
08/06/23, 18:29 - Phillip EWYL23E0206: Okay Noted.
08/06/23, 18:35 - Ananya: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about

Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
08/06/23, 18:35 - Ananya: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe.
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5â€™S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5â€™S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
08/06/23, 18:35 - Ananya: .
08/06/23, 18:38 - Phillip EWYL23E0206: Okay l will get on to it ..l already have one 2 students on board
