12/07/22, 17:15 - Tenzin: Good Morning, Anna
I hope that you are in good health and spirits
12/07/22, 17:18 - Tenzin: That's Great!
Anna, Let us try to increase the inflow of videos for this week.
I want you to improve your ranking in the leaderboard.
12/07/22, 18:35 - Anna EWYL21E0882: Good morning sir. I'm a proud Edoofian.
12/07/22, 18:37 - Tenzin: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

13/07/22, 17:56 - Anna EWYL21E0882: *Saturday activity*

The skills that are needed for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring in a lot of learning are knowledge of the project, team management,  time management,  leadership skills, communication skills and negotiation skills.

In order for one to tackle projects that are challenging one needs to have knowledge of the project so that it can be easy. Having the knowledge will bring a lot of learning and make the project a success. Team management is also a skill because working as a team will make the project go smoothly. A person must be able to manage time and utilize it for the period given to do the project. 

Leadership skills are required for one to lead and able to manage projects that are challenging and we also learn that in order to do a project one has to be a leader. Communicating with each other is good when doing challenging projects. Lastly someone needs to negotiation  .

13/07/22, 18:01 - Tenzin: Anna, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.

I hope that you are in good health and spirits.

While going through our conversation, I noticed that you haven't submitted *Wednesday's Lesson* yet.
The deadline to make the submission is *Thursday* *6 PM*. Please make sure that you submit your response before that because the *Academic Board* keeps a very strict check on these things. 
 
The aim of this activity is to make you aware of the life journey of Patrice Motsepe and how you can inculcate his traits in your daily life.
15/07/22, 18:03 - Tenzin: After you have gone through the above messave regarding the Wednesday Lesson, Let us start with our previous discussion on the Company Project
15/07/22, 18:46 - Anna EWYL21E0882: Good morning sir. I am in good health and spirit.
15/07/22, 18:47 - Anna EWYL21E0882: Ok
15/07/22, 19:21 - Tenzin: Yesterday, You asked about how you can search these companies, right?
15/07/22, 19:56 - Tenzin: Anna, Did you submit any videos yesterday on the ISAAC app?
15/07/22, 20:07 - Anna EWYL21E0882: *Wednesday activity*

I like the commitment to growth and high success rates in Pratrice Motsepe's job activities which got his bosses to take interest in him. Reading of books and articles in order to explore in mining was the thing that I was inspired by. I was inspired when he said the successful mines don't have to be the large ones, but rather any one, especially small ones that better managed their finances and operations. Even if you are a black person nothing can stop you from being successful like what Pratrice did when he started African Rainbow Minerals.  I liked the fact that his company expanded to great lengths and he never gave up on his dream. The other thing I liked is that the company has strategic partnerships and meeges with other mining organizations.
15/07/22, 20:08 - Anna EWYL21E0882: Yes.
15/07/22, 20:10 - Anna EWYL21E0882: I did not submit any.
15/07/22, 20:28 - Tenzin: I am very happy after going through your response. ?
Proud Edoofians, These are the footsteps that we have to follow. The traits that he gained and possessed are not something that could be taught in schools\/ universities. That is why our head coach, Ms. Davi, tries that through every lesson you are able to get one step closer towards gaining these traits and making your career sucessful.
15/07/22, 20:28 - Tenzin: Why, Anna?
Are you facing any challenges?
15/07/22, 23:03 - Anna EWYL21E0882: I didn't have data.

11/10/23, 14:23 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's "Wednesday Wisdom" session will delve into the topic of peak performance and the significance of focus in achieving success. We've all heard experts advise us to concentrate, eliminate distractions, and commit to mastering one thing. This guidance is undoubtedly valuable, and the more I study successful individuals from various fields—be it artists, athletes, entrepreneurs, or scientists—the more I am convinced that focus plays a pivotal role in their accomplishments.

Together, we'll explore strategies and ideas that can help you navigate the complex landscape of choices and find your true calling.
Read the PDF very carefully and we will connect in our upcoming session.

Till Then
Happy Learning!

12/10/23, 01:17 - Anna EWYL21E0882: *Wednesday lesson*

It is said that peak performance experts often emphasize the importance of concentration and the removal of distractions , along with the recommendation to dedicate oneself to a single pursuit in order to excel. I have learnt that focus serves as a fundamental pillars of success. A person must know their goals and know were to focus. At the time ones must pay attention. I have understood that an entrepreneur must track their marketing and promotion effort. That is needed to boost business. The other thing I learnt is that decision is one of the central tension of entrepreneurship. There is no recipe for entrepreneurship , only your best is needed. I also learnt that sometimes one don't need more information but they just need to make a choice. A person must learn to work under pressure not to be relactant. That is why you have to fall in love with boredom and stay in the bus.  I understand that a person can identify greatness but on the other hand they don't understand how to achieve it until work it out.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to let you know that today's Wednesday lesson is going to be a special one. We'll be delving into a captivating story that revolves around the themes of skill, hard work, and determination.

The moral of this story is a powerful one, and it's a lesson that we can carry with us throughout our lives: "Sometimes the truest treasures lay not in the allure of gold but in the craftsmanship and effort one invests in their work." This story will remind us of the value of dedication and the importance of striving for excellence in everything we do.

So, come prepared to listen, learn, and be inspired by this tale of determination and the rewards it can bring. We'll discuss the story, its characters, and the valuable lesson it imparts.

See you in our upcoming session, and let's explore the world of skill, hard work, and the true treasures that lie within our reach.

Best regards,
Team EWYL!
