How are you?
09/10/22, 16:34 - Unknown: Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. Those unfamiliar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.
Responses will be accepted on the *EWYL Line* only.
_Till then keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'_.

Happy learning and enjoy your weekend!

17/08/22, 21:33 - Yananisai EWYL22E0423: 1.the success mantra that l have mastered and that best suits my personality is to stay away from negative people and to block negative thoughts......l like being positive because it helps achieve something



2.the success habit that l wish to master by the end of this year is to be able to accept challenges and not to be weak



3.my role model is my father ....he's a hard worker and he's a self less person ...he always thinks about others before himself...he's that person who sacrifice's he's happiness for us instead of him doing something for himself 

The success behaviors l admire most about him are

1: time keeping
2: hard working
3:makes things happen instead of making them happen

18/08/22, 21:59 - Unknown: I read your response to the weekend activity and I feel that habits are behaviors that work repeatedly and are reinforced. Regardless of the outcome and whether it's positive or negative, we do things because we receive reinforcement for that behavior. 
Every habit helps to enhance the other. When even just one habit is implemented the output will be great. As we all strive toward bettering ourselves we should take into consideration the eleven habits of success. 

And I read about your motivation person, I am glad it is your father and I see how he encourages you to do better.
18/08/22, 22:03 - Yananisai EWYL22E0423: Yes ma'am

25/08/22, 19:41 - Unknown: Yes, I completely understood what you are saying Yananisai and I am so proud and happy that you have expressed yourself to me and shared this incident. I would like to add my opinions to the same:
Watching and learning from exceptional speakers offers one of the best ways to improve your public speaking skills. To start, search for examples of great public speakers on YouTube.

When you watch these individuals, take note of their body language. You'll find that it tends to remain open and inviting. They use their arms and hands in ways that accentuate their key points. They also avoid unnecessary fidgeting and wisely use the space provided to them to capture the audience's attention.

Pay particular attention to how speakers pace themselves. They tend to take their time and deliver their words intentionally. Additionally, they use pauses to keep the audience engaged and do not rush themselves. They may use humor or anecdotes in appropriate and effective ways.
25/08/22, 19:42 - Unknown: I am doing great, thanks for asking.
25/08/22, 19:44 - Unknown: The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known to suffer, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of those depths.
The three said sharing their stories should inspire youths to work hard toward achieving their goals and shun a life of drugs.
This lesson was something that added so much to my knowledge and yes, took me one step ahead in this stage of learning:
So in our session today, we will:
1. talk about how these three brains inspired you
2. discussion on the community building project (I will share audio and form with you, please go through it, and then we will discuss the same)
