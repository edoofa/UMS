25/08/22, 19:03 - Unknown: Greetings Kudzai!
How are you doing?
25/08/22, 19:17 - Unknown: The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known to suffer, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of those depths.
The three said sharing their stories should inspire youths to work hard toward achieving their goals and shun a life of drugs.
This lesson was something that added so much to my knowledge and yes, took me one step ahead in this stage of learning:
So in our session today, we will:
1. talk about how these three brains inspired you
2. discussion on the community building project ( I will be sharing audio and form with you, once we discuss the lesson, we will go on it)

I hope you are doing well!

The Class of 2022, as well as new graduate and professional students, have settled in but many are probably wondering what the next few years hold for them with Edoofa. One key element of Orientation is, as its name implies, getting students going in the right direction. Part of that is feeling welcomed and at home here on campus. Part is learning how to put your best foot forward, regardless of your background and previous experiences.

We are planning a pre-orientation session because the orientation program will now take place in the first few weeks of September. This session will be led by Ms. Davi, who will inform you of a few crucial details and have a wonderful surprise in store for every one of you.

The pre-orientation will take place through Google meet on Friday, 26th August, 7:30 PM IST.

Link:https:\/\/meet.google.com\/com-cskt-dkp

Kindly join 10 minutes in advance as the session will start exactly at 7:30 PM and students joining post 7:30 PM will not be allowed to join.

25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
