Today's Wednesday Wisdom is not just special but carries a powerful reminder of the true essence of Christmas. As we stand on the brink of the festive season, it's crucial to reflect on the values that unite us as a community.

Beyond the glittering lights and festive decorations, Christmas serves as a poignant reminder of the core values that bind humanity together. It's a time when love, compassion, and generosity take center stage, fostering a sense of togetherness and shared joy.

Let's take a moment today to embrace the spirit of Christmas, appreciating the significance of our connections with one another. The lessons learned during this festive season go beyond the celebration itself, leaving a lasting impact on the way we interact with those around us.

May this Wednesday Wisdom inspire you to carry the spirit of Christmas not just during the holiday season but throughout the year! üéÑ‚ú®

Wishing you a joyous and reflective Wednesday!

Warm regards,

26/12/23, 23:37 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0095: Hello Friends
I am Tadiwanashe Kustime a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5‚ÄôS which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship* and after that the counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
26/12/23, 23:38 - Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0095: So the above was the application l sent out for community building
