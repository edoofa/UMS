12/07/22, 21:54 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation.

12/07/22, 22:05 - Takunda EWYL21E0605: A student should possess these skills to be able to participate in the skooqs programme and earn more scholarship programme:

*Time consciousness*
A student should be time conscious. This involves following given deadlines for the projects without delay and being punctual if they're sessions to be attended. Just like it is said in the business world, time is money

*Broad Mindset*
This is the same as thinking outside the box. To be able to come out with brilliant ideas which can aid the to the success of the projects 

*Positive attitude*
One should possess a very positive attitude towards work and a very positive mentality because it's not going to be an easy task to do these projects. They're many demoralized aspects, so a positive attitude would make work easier.

*Clear communication*
During the course of the projects, one should maintain a stable communication with his\/ her Mentor so that he\/she can be helped and be able to be progressive with the projects 

*Commitment*
Commitment is a very essential skill in doing anything. One should be committed to the projects and be able to do the projects full heartedly, doing things half heartedly will not yield the optimum to best required results. 

*Discipline*
Discipline is almost the same as commitment but being disciplined is more about being hands on and not being disturbed by anything, it involves commitment and focus combined. So one should be focused and be committed to the projects, and with the right motivation, anything is possible
12/07/22, 22:06 - Takunda EWYL21E0605: Those are among other the essential skills needed, but I'll think of more skills required

14/07/22, 02:25 - Unknown: Greetings of the day *TAKUNDA*!
How are you?
14/07/22, 02:25 - Unknown: First of all I am so proud to see your understanding of being a proud EDOOFIAN.
14/07/22, 02:26 - Unknown: Secondly, I am really glad to hear your understanding of the activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY* . They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.
14/07/22, 03:47 - Takunda EWYL21E0605: Thank you Ma'am. I'll work harder and more strategically
14/07/22, 23:35 - Unknown: Hello my proud EDOOFIAN!

From his dad’s small foray into entrepreneurship, Patrice Motsepe got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe’s success story is a remarkable one showing how curiosity, doggedness, perseverance, and the knack to exploit great opportunities as they come, can determine how successful or not, any individual could become. 
And this was all about our WEDNESDAY WISDOM.
Hope you have gone through it.

25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
26/07/22, 00:04 - Takunda EWYL21E0605: *Growth mindset of successful people and how I'm going to develop the same mindset:*

1) Identifying passion
Successful people identify where their passion is and they work within those lanes. This is because it's much easier to give all you got to something you really love or by choice rather than a sense of responsibility of just doing something:

*a)Flexibility*
When you're doing something you're passion about you tend to become flexible and very open minded to new ideas which lead to a successful development in the field of interest.


*2)The concept of putting effort*
This involves the belief that putting effort to intelligence and skills development in a particular field can yield to success. This is also called the growth mindset.

*a)We grow from resilience and hard work, not intelligence alone*
To achieve a growth mindset of successful people, there's a lot of resilience and perseverance rather than intelligence. We have to shun that mindset of believing that its only the intelligent that will always be successful because what's correct in reality is it's mostly hard work and resilience

*b)Cultivating discipline*
Discipline is a hard quality to cultivate but it's essential for us to have a growth mindset of successful people. This involves being timetable to complete our steps to success and following the rules we've set to ourselves aided to success. This is the time when we keep our mindset fixed a little to make things work for ourselves. Do the task no Matter how boring it is. Self discipline at the end if the day yields to habits which are aided to our success. For example, if a Mathematics student is disciplined to work on mathematical problems everyday, after some time it becomes a habit that he can't do without. It's sort if building an addiction to passion

*c)Removing fear of failure*
Most people's minds do not grow and remain fixed because of the fear of failure, this is a major drawback. They believe that failure

26/07/22, 02:52 - Takunda EWYL21E0605: Greetings to you Sir\/Ma'am

My name is Takunda R. Madyanenhire and I'm a proud beneficiary of the Edoofa scholarship program. Edoofa is a scholarship program whose goal is to help African students attain the best education abroad. It offers students a 50-100% scholarship. The 100% scholarship can be attained through earning what are called scholarship credits which can be earned through the program they initiated called *EWYL*, Earn While You Learn Program. As a beneficiary of this ever growing scholarship program, I took the liberty of engaging school principals or headmasters about the scholarship program.I enrolled into the program last year and I'm departing for India this August.

Allow me to share a letter with you from the founders of the scholarship program.

For more information, you can also Google the link www.Edoofa.com
26/07/22, 16:34 - Takunda EWYL21E0605: Morning. Do you have permission from the Ministry of Prim & Sec Education to do this with schools?

I see people of different races in the picture as one big happy family which means people in India are very friendly and there is a little amount of racism. The picture has a lot of people too.

27/07/22, 20:28 - Takunda EWYL21E0605: The smiles look very broad and brilliant ma'am, it's very motivating and inspiring. Also the atmosphere of happiness from those faces
27/07/22, 20:28 - Unknown: I read your understanding of the activity and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it’s not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you’re looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don’t do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.

It may be better to think about time management as a combination of working productively and prioritizing your time.

Our *Wednesday Wisdom* was all about Time Management and understanding the priority matrix to organize our tasks. 
I am really excited to hear your understanding and working on the same.
Please share it with me here.
In today's session we will talk about:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom

29/07/22, 18:34 - Unknown: Your response to the Wednesday wisdom has made me realize our childhood quote  is Money'.
Through Wednesday Wisdom, my main aim was to educate my Edoofians about TIME MANAGEMENT and HOW IT CAN BE ACHIEVED.
You know are very well aware of what Time management means, let me tell you about *what Time Management includes*:

#Effective Planning
# Setting goals and objectives
# Setting deadlines
# Delegation of responsibilities
# Prioritizing activities as per their importance
# Spending the right time on the right activity

*The benefits of Time Management are*:
- Time Management makes an individual punctual and disciplined.
- One becomes more organized as a result of effective Time Management.
- Individuals who stick to a time plan are the ones who realize their goals and objectives within the shortest possible period. 
- Research says that individuals who accomplish tasks on time are less prone to stress and anxiety. 

*How can we achieve it*:
# Set a goal for yourself.
# Priority matrix (like we talked about in the Wednesday lesson)
# Organize your study space
# Do a SWOT Analysis of yourself.

I am sure you will note all these things and imply in your day-to-day life and do share with me what changes you have felt.

It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
31/07/22, 21:34 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. \r
﻿\r
So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!\r
﻿\r
Happy Weekend!\r
