27/11/23, 06:20 - Chiedza EWYL22E0119: Good morning ma'am  
Thank you for sharing the activity. Personally, I think it's good, for people to compete, for certain reasons, for example in activities at school, or extra curricular activities as well. When I was in high school, I entered my poems in the annual Girls poet competition, and I always got a first class certificate, but to be honest, from my perspective, and my own thoughts, I didn't enter because I wanted to win or compete with other girls, I just did it for fun, and to gain experience, and if it were meant to be, to also add to the certificates I already have. Because fate decides our destiny, it's not always about the competition.  The spirit of competition, usually tends to disappoint and leads to frustration because there can only be one winner, so, I guess it's best for a person to compete with his/herself, inorder to achieve personal growth, at their own pace, rather than doing things in order to be a prize winner compared to other people.

14/07/22, 17:36 - Chiedza EWYL22E0119: The you for sharing the pdf document, it was truly inspiring
14/07/22, 17:36 - Chiedza EWYL22E0119: I have learnt a handful from Mr Motsepe. From being a school teachers son to becoming an award winning billionaire is quite inspiring. 

 Now I also believe in humble beginnings. Through his drive and commitment as mentioned,  he achieved great things.


Him being  a hardworking man has taught me that it is possible to get recognized by employers to get rare opportunities.  
I've also learnt that one does not always necessarily have to have a teacher in front of them to learn some concepts,  like Mr Motsepe, grabbing a book of interest and thoroughly studying it can teach one  a lot, and understanding a certain concept.
 


Exposure got him to realize his interests lay on mining, and I admire his financial wisdom, he managed to save money, that landed him a mine! 

He is truly an inspiration.
14/07/22, 17:40 - Jasmine Kaur: Chiedza, I am really glad that the lesson was able to inspire you and you learnt that one has to create the opportunities and not wait for them. 
Also, like you mentioned that one always doesn’t need a teacher but you realise that you have a mentor with you already and you can make the most out of it.
14/07/22, 18:47 - Chiedza EWYL22E0119: True, we just have to always be prepared for opportunities

18/07/22, 18:14 - Jasmine Kaur: Cyber security is one among the many fast grrowing sectors in Zimbabwe. Due to the Covid 19 pandemic there has been an upward trend in the use of the internet and technological gadgets. With this also came an increase in cyber crimes hence the demand for cyber security.
With everything going virtual, the cyber security sector is facing rapid growth. The recent estimates suggest that cyber security globally will grow by over $50 billion by the end of 2022.
The online work and study from home modality means that the risks of cyber attacks will rise. People in Zimbabwe will now need to ensure data protection and digital security. For those in this sector, opportunities span beyond antivirus software to also including data backup services given the accelerated growth in the sector. Cyber security is trending on the market as many businesses and individuals have become more technologically oriented in Zimbabwe. 
The Zimbabwean government is also making plans to to invest more in cyber security in light of growing cyber crimes and increased use of digital platforms by businesses, non governmental organisations ( NGO), individuals and the government itself.

31/07/22, 06:28 - Jasmine Kaur: Sat Activity: 

Hello my Proud Edoofians, hope you are doing well. 

A well-constructed timetable establishes a natural rhythm and routine, which can be comforting students as well as their mentors. Having a plan as a learner is very important as it helps you maximize and prioritize on the things that are of urgency or importance. Most students do not have an organized study plan and if they do, they fail to follow the plan drawn. As the Wednesday Wisdom offered advice on how to use our time wisely. You must share your daily schedules with your mentors as part of your Saturday activity in the format that has been provided. You can check the image of a timetable and draw it on paper and show it to your mentors. Do not forget to provide the scheduled time for your EWYL programme.
Deadline  11 AM

Happy learning and growing.

Also, you can submit the response to *Saturday task.*
08/08/22, 20:44 - Chiedza EWYL22E0119: Good morning.
Thank you for sharing the story on Mr Peters. 


It's surprising that his career grew from a very young age. I've learnt from him that it's a good thing to keep an eye out for such opportunities like the one he hot from the NGO. 

And I admire him for recruiting two of his friends in the dish installing business. This taught me that it's a good thing to also uplift those around us. To help better the lives of those in the community, when given the opportunity. 

He got help from his girlfriend,  this taught me that I should be aware of the type of company I keep and the people I get into relationships with. I should put myself in relations with people with goals as I do, people who will be with me through thick and thin. And people who wish me well, and can work as bridges, and helping hands for me, as I work towards achieving my goals. 


He went on and got married to her, at a young age as mentioned, and he did so  despite what his peers were saying. This has taught me that no matter what people say to bring me down or may cause me to change my decisions, even when people use words that may discourage me, I should remain focused and must keep on working towards my goal no matter what
