25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

01/10/22, 21:01 - Florentina EWYL22E0087: I am fine
01/10/22, 21:01 - Unknown: I hope you are aware that every morning you have to come on the EWYL Line and follow the daily ritual of saying ' I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line.
Please do this without fail and with reminders.
01/10/22, 21:02 - Florentina EWYL22E0087: Okay i had forgotten
01/10/22, 21:10 - Florentina EWYL22E0087: I well understood it

03/10/22, 14:26 - Florentina EWYL22E0087: I am a proud Edoofian
03/10/22, 14:27 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

05/10/22, 20:27 - Unknown: Greetings Florentina!
How are you?
05/10/22, 20:27 - Unknown: Please excuse me for the inconvenience caused in yesterday's session, I was facing severe connectivity issues so I was not able to take your session.
Your session will be held on Friday as per our schedule since the organization is observing an off today on the eve of our religious festival, Dussehra.
Once I come back on Friday for your session, I want that you get some research done on what is Dussehra and why it is celebrated, we will surely discuss it in our session on Friday along with your weekend activity response, which will be very much exciting?
05/10/22, 20:27 - Unknown: Along with this, please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'.
05/10/22, 20:27 - Unknown: I see that you have typed three this shows unclarity as to who a proud edoofian is and what it denotes.
05/10/22, 20:28 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
05/10/22, 20:28 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
