20/12/22, 21:20 - Lorent EWYL22E0724: Hello
20/12/22, 23:13 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr
21/12/22, 01:01 - Jasmine Kaur: Let’s call it an edoofian day!

13/01/23, 17:23 - Lorent EWYL22E0724: I hope you are doing well
13/01/23, 17:24 - Jasmine Kaur: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

I am apologetic for the delayed response; I was spending quality time with my family!

I understand your problem, I appreciate the way you’ve made an effort to not miss your session but please let me know by when are you expecting your phone to be fine. 

I hope you enjoyed New Year,
I am really excited to know what you did on the NYE!!

14/01/23, 21:47 - Lorent EWYL22E0724: Also I wanted to ask that how far have you gone with the details of the student igave you (Deborah Monjeza)
15/01/23, 03:59 - Jasmine Kaur: Hope you and everyone in your family is also doing good!

 The ability to solve problems is a basic life skill and is essential to our day-to-day lives, at home, at school, and at work. We solve problems every day without really thinking about how we solve them. For example: it’s raining and you need to go to the store. What do you do? There are lots of possible solutions. Take your umbrella and walk. If you don't want to get wet, you can drive, or take the bus. There is no right way to solve this problem and different people will solve it differently. However in our Wednesday wisdom we learnt about some Problem solving strategies. As part of your Saturday activity, I want you to share with us a problem that you encountered very recently and how did you Solve It. Did you use any strategy that was similar to what Munger has talked about?

Looking forward to your responses!


We will continue the discussion we left on Monday!

17/01/23, 19:45 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my lovely edoofians, hope you are doing well.

I have some amazing news and an opportunity to share with you. But first, do you know, A 2018 report by WaterAid India and Menstrual Hygiene Alliance India (MHAI) states that there are 336 million menstruating women in India, out of which only 121 million use sanitary pads. Assuming that these women use eight sanitary pads for one cycle (conservatively), a simple calculation reveals that almost one billion sanitary pads are used and disposed of every year.  The primary component in all disposable sanitary napkins is plastic. This takes approximately 500-800 years to fully disintegrate after disposal. Assuming one billion DSNs are disposed of every year, handling menstrual waste becomes a mammoth task.

And the solution to this problem is Sustainable menstruation!

Wondering what it is :

* Sustainable menstruation refers to the use of alternative products during one’s menstrual cycle for the benefit of the body and the earth.
* Sustainable menstruation is being mindful of the negative effects disposable sanitary products have on our environment in an effort to reduce the plastic waste ending up in our oceans or landfills.

I would like to invite you to our webinar on Sustainable menstruation tomorrow I.e. 18th January 2023, wherein we will be joined by Dr.Aarushi Kehar Malhotra. She will be helping us understand it better and how can each one of us be the solution to this problem.

Don’t forget to join by 5:45 PM IST, the webinar will start exactly at 6:00 PM [2:30 PM: Zimbabwean time] . Don’t be late for this webinar. Come prepared with the questions that you might have!

Time for our Wednesday wisdom, let us dive deep into the art of asking good questions. While listening is an important skill, the art of asking questions is equally, if not more, important when it comes to learning more about your work tasks, unlocking hidden opportunities, delivering better results, and mitigating unforeseen risks. Read the PDF carefully and share your learnings with me in our upcoming session. 

Happy learning!
20/01/23, 21:50 - Lorent EWYL22E0724: Iam aproud Edoofian
20/01/23, 21:50 - Lorent EWYL22E0724: Asking good questions leads to good answers.


Below are the guidelines of how to ask good questions:;
1.Know your purpose:
Make sure every question you ask helps you gather either facts or you interlocutor opinion.Try to know More about them and avoid empty questions fill your time hence frame your questions accordingly

2.start by listening :
You can't ask agood question if you don't listen to what the person has to say , that is why Dale Carnegie advised to be agood listener and to ask questions to other person will enjoy answering for more than 80 years and it still applies update because it's true and it works 

3.interrupt wisely
End your fewer sentences with aperiod and more with questions mark .
Don't worry about about asking wrong questions
Not asking enough is more detrimental building arelationship than asking one poorly phrased question that is being said 


4.use the right wording 
-Avoid leading questions and use a neutral tone instead.
-Refrain hinting at your opinion or the answer you had like to get 
- if you want honest opinions or accurate information don't frame your interlocutor with loaded questions
- Keep them open-minded so they have the option of giving you an answer you didn't expect 

5.Build ahierarchy:
- Follow general questions with specific ones 
-Focus your questions so they ask one thing at a time 
- Use something in answer you got to frame your next question.This will help the conversation flow more naturally
Eventually out of all the guidelines mentioned above ,the most guideline or the extremely important guideline is \"asking more questions\"
20/01/23, 21:50 - Lorent EWYL22E0724: That's what I got  madam......iam aproud Edoofian Laurent Mwiriha ✊?....

22/01/23, 04:32 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings my proud edoofian, Here is your Saturday task. 
Make sure you submit it on Monday.

Sat activity: 

A college student named Rachel was unsure of what career path to pursue after graduation. She talked to several professionals in different fields, but none of them seemed to fit her interests and skills. One day, she had a conversation with a mentor who asked her the right questions, such as \"What are you passionate about?\" and \"What do you enjoy doing in your free time?\" Rachel realized that her true passion was writing and storytelling. She decided to pursue a career in journalism and landed a job at a top news outlet.

We gained knowledge on how to ask intelligent questions. I'd like you to share with us any two questions you'd like to ask yourself as part of your Saturday submission. The questions that you may have been hesitant to make, the questions that put you in a difficult situation, the inquiries that will have a significant impact on your career and future. For example:  1. What is the limit of my current capabilities and how can I push beyond them to continue learning and growing?\"
2. “How can I ensure that my actions align with my values and contribute to the greater good, rather than just maximizing my own success?\"

Looking forward to your response!
26/01/23, 19:33 - Lorent EWYL22E0724: Iam aproud Edoofian
26/01/23, 19:35 - Lorent EWYL22E0724: Greetings madam

Q2

27/01/23, 19:05 - Jasmine Kaur: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
I hope you are doing well,

Yesterday, I was not able to take your session because yesterday on 26th January we celebrated the Indian Republic day. The significance of the day is to commemorate the Indian Constitution as the supreme law of the country and to honour the country's military and cultural legacy. Republic Day is also celebrated in state capitals and other cities across India, with parades, patriotic songs, and cultural performances.
