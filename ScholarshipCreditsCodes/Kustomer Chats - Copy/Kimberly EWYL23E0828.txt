14/11/23, 13:55 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: Thank you
14/11/23, 14:08 - Ananya: Kimberly, may I ask why are you late today?
14/11/23, 14:13 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: Good day.
I had attended my sister's burial at our rural home and we delayed leaving there so I was our of network connection.
I did send a message to Ms Ananya's inbox explaining this as soon as I was reachable.
14/11/23, 14:14 - Ananya: Kimberly, I'm truly sorry to hear about the loss of your sister. Losing a loved one is never easy, and attending a funeral can be a challenging and emotional experience. It's understandable that you might have been out of network connection during that time, as rural areas sometimes have limited connectivity.
If there's anything specific you'd like to talk about or if you have any questions, feel free to share. Whether it's about coping with grief, dealing with the logistics of the situation, or just having someone to talk to, I'm here to help as much as I can.
14/11/23, 14:18 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: Thank you very much. It's really sad,the worst being she just suffered a cardiac arrest,at 26 years of age. We are still in so much shock
14/11/23, 14:21 - Ananya: I'm truly sorry to hear about your sister's passing, especially at such a young age.
14/11/23, 14:22 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: Thank you
14/11/23, 14:44 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: So how best can I make up for the missed session?
15/11/23, 11:20 - Ananya: Greetings, Kimberly!
Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect earlier as there was a technical glitch.
15/11/23, 11:23 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: Good day to you.
I understand. Thank you very much
15/11/23, 18:21 - Ananya: Happy Wednesday! 🌟
Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

17/11/23, 13:00 - Ananya: Good morning, Kimberly!
How are you doing today?
17/11/23, 13:01 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: Am doing much better today thank you
17/11/23, 13:17 - Ananya: Kindly excuse me for the delayed response; there was a technical glitch.
17/11/23, 13:24 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: It's okay. I understand
17/11/23, 13:27 - Ananya: So, Kimberly have you had a chance to read your wednesday lesson about facing challenges and uncertainties, especially the part about Alex turning adversity into triumph? I'd love to hear your thoughts on how his story resonates with the idea of viewing challenges as stepping stones for growth rather than roadblocks.
17/11/23, 13:38 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: generally in life, people tend to allow difficulties and challenges to weigh them down and determine their course of life.
However, there's a saying that goes ' look for the positive aspect in every circumstances ' .Once  you find it ,it will help propel you forward rather than deter you. Alex knew that his only key to success was education. As a result, he did not allow every other circumstance to hinder him. Instead he let that situation drive him forward in pursuit of a brighter future
17/11/23, 13:44 - Ananya: Absolutely, your perspective resonates strongly with the idea that one's outlook can greatly influence their path in life. The saying 'look for the positive aspect in every circumstance' holds a profound truth. It's commendable that Alex understood the pivotal role of education in his success and chose not to be deterred by surrounding challenges. Instead, he used those challenges as fuel to drive him toward a brighter future.
17/11/23, 13:48 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: Indeed.I honestly love this story.it strongly aligns with my personal principle;to attain a good education despite the hardships at home especially considering being raised by a single mother. I believe this is my only key into a pleasant future for us all
17/11/23, 13:50 - Ananya: Absolutely, Kimberly, to begin with, I would suggest that we proceed with something that aligns with your interest. So, would you like to share which one is your favorite project: the community building or the school reform project?
17/11/23, 14:01 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: Both projects are quite interesting to me. However,I would say I love the school reform project more.
This is because I believe the younger we catch them ,the better. In addition, it has a wider catchment area than the community one as the Edoofa word is spread to a large gathering of students at one go.
The project also gives me a chance to interact with various school heads nd get them to listen to me,which is a rare opportunity for someone my age.
17/11/23, 14:06 - Ananya: That's great, Kimberly! So, may I ask if you have searched for some school heads' contact numbers?
17/11/23, 14:09 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: I honestly have not been been able to do this yet because we were having very tight exam schedules at school
17/11/23, 14:12 - Ananya: That's alright. However, you know, during these exam times, you can proceed with your community-building project. After exams, you can talk to students in your school and let me know about the program.
17/11/23, 14:12 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: Okay. Noted
17/11/23, 14:15 - Ananya: Now, get ready because our next session is going to be super exciting! We'll dive deeper into this topic and explore some fantastic ideas on how you can maintain unwavering consistency in your projects. It's crucial that we collaborate and devise a new plan of action to achieve our goals together! So, gear up and bring your creativity and enthusiasm to the table because we're going to make amazing progress! Get pumped! 🚀
17/11/23, 14:16 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: Amazing. I am looking forward to this
18/11/23, 16:16 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one – it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!

24/11/23, 13:22 - Ananya: Good morning, Kimberly!

I hope you're doing well. Let's kick off our session with an exciting activity! I'd love to hear about your favorite animal, and in return, I'll share an amazing fact about it. Are you ready?
24/11/23, 13:23 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: Yes I am ready
24/11/23, 13:24 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: My favourite animal is a zebra. I just love it's beauty
24/11/23, 13:27 - Ananya: Well, yes talking about it's beauty, did you know that no two zebras have the same stripes? It's like having a one-of-a-kind coat that sets each zebra apart from the others in the herd.
24/11/23, 13:28 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: Ohh really?That's really amazing.i never knew that
24/11/23, 13:32 - Ananya: Indeed, it's amazing! Absolutely! Well, did you get a chance to read your Wednesday lesson and understand the dynamics of competition?

24/11/23, 13:55 - Ananya: Kindly excuse me the constant delay in our conversation today, I am facing some technical difficulties.
24/11/23, 13:56 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: I understand ma'am.
24/11/23, 14:02 - Ananya: You know, 2023 is wrapping up. Don't you think we should kick off the new year with something big? How about committing to earning a specific amount of scholarship credits?

After all, you wouldn't want to head to India empty-handed.
I'm saying this from my own experience – having some credits before you arrive in India isn't just a benefit for you; it's a help for your parents too. Not only this, we often pick students for internships and personal training based on their credits and regularity in the EWYL journey.

Believe me, you've got plenty of time right now being in your home country, so don;t you think we should utilise this time with our utmost dedication?
24/11/23, 14:05 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: Yes I totally agree ma'am
24/11/23, 14:10 - Ananya: Great, so  I have finalized a few of my students for a 30-day challenge. During this duration I want you to dedicatedly attend the sessions and work hard on your EWYL Projects.

Not only this, I will set a target for you and you have to commit to work hard to achieve those targets. Being your mentor I will be there to help you in each process. I that alright?
24/11/23, 14:12 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: Yes that is alright. Thank you very much
24/11/23, 14:18 - Ananya: Amazing! Let's set a new target for you. For the first 10 days out of the 30, I want you to focus on connecting with two schools and getting eight students to submit their offline application forms.

If you encounter any challenges during this time, reach out to me immediately because we need to achieve this target. I expect you to give it your best effort.
24/11/23, 14:19 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: 8 students from each school or in total?
24/11/23, 14:20 - Ananya: I want you to connect with two school heads for your third project and eight students for your community building project.
24/11/23, 14:23 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: Well understood ma'am
24/11/23, 14:50 - Ananya: Now, I wish you a good luck for your task. Let us connect in our next session so that we can discuss about your progress.
24/11/23, 14:51 - Kimberly EWYL23E0828: Thank you very much.
Have a pleasant weekend

25/11/23, 21:02 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
