I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

Inputs are the tools you need to o do a certain task for example data information, and recourses. Being able to analyze your inputs allows you to make informed decisions and better choices in life Alo understand your task better.
Outputs are the necessities you put in your task.
Learning from your mistake also helps you to refine your tasks as you are able to point out your areas of strength and weakness and make a review on your task and make informed decisions and better choices in the future.
