The strength of the company.
We have Job creation in all sectors and all parts of the community in agriculture and technology.
Clean renewable fuel at the pump.
Fuel security.foreign currency savings and balance of trade this has boosted our country economy and energy as well .
Cheaper local fuel as well.
The company has it's weakness such as economic downturn, climate change due to too much heat and leading to less water in the river Wich they use for irrigation in the agriculture sector.

Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.
