14/10/22, 19:36 - Unknown: I am also fine, Thelma.
Thanks for asking.

May I know if you have your conversation with Ms Megha regarding the concerns that you shared?
14/10/22, 19:52 - Thelma EWYL21E0781: Yes sir I did and I'm glad that they right away cleaned the bathrooms and toilets...now my concern is on food, ulcers get disturbed with too spicy fooda
14/10/22, 19:52 - Thelma EWYL21E0781: Foods
14/10/22, 22:31 - Unknown: Let me convey this to the team too.
Since you were not active on the EWYL DEDICATED LINE this Wednesday. Therefore, I was not able to share the Wednesday Lesson with you.

I am sharing it below.
You can have a look at it and submit it by 8 PM Today
14/10/22, 22:31 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.

Hope you are doing well. This week we learned about one of the most popular yet grounded people who used social media as a tool to become an educator and give back to the community and still become an entrepreneur.
This week I want you to reflect on what your strengths and skills are to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 

These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content etc.
Please share these skills and instances where you were able to showcase these skills in your next session.
Till then

20/10/22, 18:59 - Unknown: Hello, My Proud Edoofian.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

Hello My Proud Edoofian

Hope you’re doing well. We know most of you have your exams going on since we got a lot of emails to continue after the exams. While we appreciate that students like you are taking on the responsibility to be accountable for your unavailability, we need to ensure that the emails shared have to be in the right format. 
Email writing is a skill that each professional must possess. An email should be written with an intent to share information formally with your colleagues\/seniors\/mentors etc. 
In today’s activity, we want you to write an email sharing your exam schedule and your date of rejoining the EWYL sessions. 
Also attach your exam schedule\/date sheet as a part of the email.

For the one’s who are yet to start with their exams or don’t have them ongoing, write an email addressing your mentor about what has been their contribution in shaping your career so far and one thing that you want to learn from them. Please mention specific information.

Please feel free to discuss if you have any queries with your mentors. 
You have to email it to : deepali@edoofa.com

12/07/22, 16:37 - Thelma EWYL21E0781: *To achieve projects that are challenging*


I must say patience is the key, one needs to have patience in order to succeed and understand that delay does not mean denial. Also one needs to be convincing and quite serious in business when contacting with the people providing solid evidence so that they do not doubt the intentions of the program. Sincerity when approaching the people or organizations is quite important, one needs to lower down their ego and be down to earth so as to be able to listen other people's sides and adjust their thoughts.

That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.

Work Done on Project 1: No progress yet

Work Done on Project 2:  I have refered 5 students to my mentor, the eighth one is yet to apply, I met her in town and she said she'll apply through Mr. Austin.

Name of the Students reached out: Charlotte Matanhire, Munyaradzi Muringwa, Mark Mutasa, Mazvita Jocelyn Mpindu and Calm

Challenges Faced if any: Great challenges the students ended up dropping out saying it's expensive for them to afford and also it's not easy to convince someone online, also the students said they can't take it as they do not have money for the plane tickets


Work Done on Project 3: I got in touch with four Headmasters from four schools.

Name of the School reached out: Nyakuipa High School, Bonda Girls' High School and St Anne's Goto High School including St Joseph's High School

Challenges Faced if any: It was hard reaching out to them as it is costly. Also I am now facing massive blue ticks as the principals are rejecting the offer.

[7\/7, 21:10] Mr Chiome St Joseph's: Will be attending a workshop whole day, maybe another day could be helpful.
Thelma if you learnt at Nyakuipa  High what is it that connects us? 
[7\/12, 10:15] Tee: Okay sir, so this is a proposal if your school also wants it's students to be part of the scholarship program. It's part of my project to connect schools and it's students with Edoofa

13/07/22, 16:40 - Unknown: Good Morning, Thelma ?

Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

So, he thinks that the program does not work. I told him that it works and I'll be going this coming August and he told me to go first then he'd accept. Also, I then told him that I can help him connect with my mentor so that he can believe in us as I and my colleagues will be going soon and also some are going month-end of this July 

I acknowledged him that India is the best country for sciences studies
15/07/22, 16:23 - Thelma EWYL21E0781: *Life As A Lawyer*


After getting his LLB, in 1988, Patrice Motsepe got a great job offer from the Bowman Gilfillan law firm, which was 
one of South Africa’s most reputable law firms.


*The Start Of His Business Journey*

In the law firm, Patrice Motsepo specialized in mining and business law. His exposure to the law firm of this sort made him come up with Future mining


*His Business Today*

Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe’s African Rainbow Minerals(ARM) has
been listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, making him one of the first black entrepreneurs in South Africa to own a major controlling stake in a publicly listed company.

*Lesson that I learnt*

All I need is exposure in order to excell my potential and make my dreams into reality. Every potential that I meet must be taken and used up so that I will not regret missing the opportunities later in life.
15/07/22, 17:46 - Unknown: Good Morning, Thelma?
I hope that you are good health and spirits
15/07/22, 17:46 - Unknown: I am very happy after going through your response. ?

19/07/22, 18:38 - Thelma EWYL21E0781: *Fast growing business in Zimbabwe*

Since Zimbabwe is a country that depends on Agriculture for survival, the fast growing industry is in the Agricultural sector. Farmers are growing vast amounts of Tobacco, cotton, potatoes, cabbage, tomatoes, maize, oranges and apples. These are supplied in supermarkets for sale while fresh. The maize is either sold as green mealies or is left to ripen and dry up to be sold to the GRAIN MARKETING BOARD so that it will be then sustain the citizens during droughts. The agricultural sector is growing fast because on day to day basis people depend on agriculture as every meal require greens like cauliflower and pepper thus the main income of Zimbabwe is through the agricultural sector. Also in the agricultural business cattle ranging is rising high because beef is now on demand. I see Zimbabwe becoming successful in the next 20 years if people use the income wisely, we might grow financially and even improve infrastructure development.
