The journey to your educational pinnacle begins here
22/08/23, 12:10 - Munyaradzi EWYL23E0166: Good üòä morning üåû Ma'am
22/08/23, 13:05 - Munyaradzi EWYL23E0166: üòÑ I love learning new things from the content you share. Okay, here we go... This one is from the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, and it's about how NASA engineers test rocket engines. The video shows a close-up view of the RS-25 rocket engine being tested in a giant facility. The engine is surrounded by a ring of water jets, which absorb the intense heat from the rocket's exhaust. The video also explains how this testing helps ensure that the rocket engine is safe and reliable. That's really fascinating stuff! Thanks for sharing it! üòÑ
22/08/23, 13:11 - Aditi Kapoor: Happy Tuesday! 
How are you doing today?

Let‚Äôs begin with today's session.

22/08/23, 13:19 - Munyaradzi EWYL23E0166: Also I have other new applicants
22/08/23, 13:21 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, so I would suggest you keep on sharing the forms that you receive in the EWYL group only so that Ms. Deepali can also see your progress and you can build a good rapport in front of her, I hope you got my point.
