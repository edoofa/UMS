17/05/23, 18:48 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am Abigail Mukudzei Magwaza and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Abigail EWYL22E1063
18/05/23, 17:32 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: Good afternoon ma'am how are you today?
18/05/23, 17:32 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: l am a proud EDOOFIAN
18/05/23, 17:32 - Ananya: `- That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!`

`- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.``- How do you intend to broaden this student community? 

In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.
18/05/23, 17:35 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: Servant leadership style is based on the idea that leaders prioritize serving the greater good. Leaders with this style serve their team and organization first. They donâ€™t prioritize their own objectives. Servant leadership seeks to achieve a vision by providing strong support to employees allowing  employees to learn and grow while bringing their own expertise and vision to the table. The Edoofa program founders have always been passionate about making a difference in people's lives through education.
That is a scholarly and professional environment for all our students that motivates them to make lasting contributions to society and become future leaders, both in the workplace and societies across the world.
There are different characteristics that are found in Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh, the program founders which are 
listening to members of the team by understanding and giving them attention without interrupting, getting to know your team so that you can use empathetic leadership to help them grow; helping others to create a healthy work-life balance to give them the space to heal as they might have trauma from previous toxic work experiences. A servant leader must also recognize their own strengths and weaknesses in order to understand how they fit within the overall team. They must use persuasion and influence instead of just power to get team members on the same page. They also need to be able to use big-picture thinking. With this, they can conceptualize plans for their team and their organization.
Foresight, being able to predict what will happen in the future by learning from past mistakes and using what you and your team learn to improve in the future, and also taking responsibility for your team being accountable in their role in an organization, allocate time and resources to help people and teams grow. Tools like organizational training, development programs, and growth and transformation coaching can help.
Servant leadership requires building relationships between co-workers. As a result, team members learn to trust each other and become more productive.
18/05/23, 17:35 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: noted ma'am l understand thank you very much
22/05/23, 13:13 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: Good morning ma'am how are you today?
22/05/23, 13:13 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: l am a proud EDOOFIAN
22/05/23, 13:13 - Ananya: `- That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!`

`- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.``- How do you intend to broaden this student community? 

In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor. Namaste
22/05/23, 13:13 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: Leadership skills can play a large role in a person's career development and are considered critical traits necessary to get to the top of any career field. In order to master the skill of leadership, the EWYL program, through projects, assists in learning and developing professional skills, for example, communication skills and critical thinking. Communication skills are critical to being an effective leader, whether it's presenting in front of the team, creating and writing a business strategy, or communicating with employees and clients. Critical thinking is the ability to think clearly and rationally and to understand the logical connection between ideas. creative thinkingâ€”that is, being able to think about something in a fresh way outside the box and finding a new approach to solving a problem. In order to ensure that I will be on the next list of student leaders, I will have to be dedicated, hardworking, and put maximum effort into my work. These projects will definitely make a difference and contribute to your overall development.
25/05/23, 17:40 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: Good afternoon ma'am how are you today?
25/05/23, 17:40 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: l am a proud EDOOFIAN
25/05/23, 17:40 - Ananya: Hello everyone! Our latest post on the Edoofa Instagram page is something you definitely wouldn't want to miss. Please visit our page to take a look and feel free to share your own opinions in the comments section.

25/05/23, 17:40 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: Self-awareness is an important skill to develop in the workplace, especially for young professionals in the initial years of their professional careers. It is one of the 10 life skills recognized by the WHO-World Health Organization and is key to building the life that one aspires to have. An example of this is Barack Obama, who was one of the most introverted presidents and the first black president of free America. Obama realized that he is the most productive when in solitude and has always shared how he leads a sedentary life. Obama's success can be attributed to his introverted personality and ability to prioritize his schedule.

He spent at least 4-5 hours with himself every day after dinner, creating his own space and valuing his time. Rahm Emanuel, a former chief of staff, spoke about the importance of prioritizing one's schedule and creating boundaries for oneself. Similarly, individuals can identify with their strengths and characteristics to achieve daily productivity and avoid hindrances. It is important to be self-aware and identify areas that hinder productivity.
25/05/23, 17:41 - Ananya: A lovely good morning to my Proud Edoofian! 

On this Africa Day, I would like to extend my heartfelt wishes to you. As students, you are the future leaders, innovators, and change-makers who will shape Africa's destiny.ðŸŒŸ

On this special day, let us take a moment to reflect on the achievements and progress that Africa has made, while also acknowledging the challenges that lie ahead. Africa is a land of incredible beauty, resilience, and untapped potential. As students, you have the power to unlock that potential and make a positive impact on your communities, your countries, and the entire continent.âœ¨
25/05/23, 17:42 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: Thank you very much ma'am
25/05/23, 17:43 - Ananya: So, what are your plans for celebrating Africa day today?
25/05/23, 17:47 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: Nothing much ma'am l am just going out with my friend later
25/05/23, 17:49 - Ananya: That is wonderful!
25/05/23, 17:50 - Ananya: May I know if you were able to read our Wednesday lesson?
25/05/23, 17:55 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: yes ma'am I have submitted my work
25/05/23, 17:58 - Ananya: Yes, and I agree with the sentiment expressed in your statement about self-awareness. Our Wednesday wisdom emphasized the importance of being honest with one's feelings and taking time for self-reflection. For instance, former President Obama dedicated 4-5 hours of his time alone after dinner, which allowed him to delve deeper into self-discovery.
25/05/23, 18:00 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: thank you ma'am
25/05/23, 18:25 - Ananya: May I know if you were able to search or the companies?
25/05/23, 18:42 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: yes ma'am
25/05/23, 18:43 - Ananya: So, can you share the list with me?
25/05/23, 18:51 - Ananya: Abgail, I want to emphasize the significance of this session so that you fully understand its importance. I have set aside this specific time slot exclusively for you. It is crucial that you are attentive and responsive during our discussion. Quick and timely replies are essential because if we are not able to communicate efficiently, it may hinder our progress and potentially lead to delays in completing our projects on time.

29/05/23, 12:31 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above

12/06/23, 17:33 - Ananya: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

This weekend we go back to the basics of EWYL with our 3 important keys! 
 Link: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtPOMh0pgPs/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA== 

Share in the comments if you have known this before and why is it important!!
12/06/23, 17:33 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: Deepening relationships entails improving communication skills and adopting actions that benefit everyone's well-being. Relational mindfulness can help to strengthen emotional bonds and foster healthier relationships. Face issues head on, speak up for yourself, be empathetic, accept responsibility for your actions, pay attention to your environment, and refrain from judging others. Understanding one's values and evaluating reactions might help one become a better friend and understand oneself working towards building a community of people who are ready to take on the
professional world, as soon as they graduate. A community of people who are ready to lead, and with every little step that we take, this community gets bigger and stronger. Joining a route to success with the Edoofa Program has been one of the best decisions I've made, and as a proud Edoofian, I've encouraged some of my friends to join as well, because Edoofa is a life-changing opportunity that no one wants to pass up. Edoofa has improved the lives of many people. This is by giving them the opportunity to study abroad, giving them quality education which is very affordable. Through their program EWYL students have been able to earn scholarship credits to fund their fees as well as different skills which are later going to help us in our different future careers

12/06/23, 18:04 - Ananya: Now, Abigail! I was just discussing productivity and the importance of seriousness in day-to-day life with a few of my students. Some of them expressed concerns about a decline in their performance and expressed a desire to address this issue. Hence, I thought about asking each student about their individual weaknesses and working together to overcome them. You see, I firmly believe that striving for perfection is both impossible and unnecessary. However, in order to make progress in life and stand out from the crowd, it's important to continuously strive to become a better version of ourselves. So, I wanted to inquire if you have ever encountered a situation where you identified a personal weak point and felt the need to rectify it.
12/06/23, 18:10 - Abigail EWYL22E1063: yes ma'am my weaknesses has been lack of confidence. l used to be afraid to stand in front of a crowd and sometimes doubted that I was capable of doing something but it was been something l have been working on and l am seeing positive results so far
