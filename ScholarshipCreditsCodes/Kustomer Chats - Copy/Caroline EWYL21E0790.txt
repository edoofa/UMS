I am sure that you must have had a blessed weekend
In case, You were not able to receive the Saturday Activity this weekend, I am sharing it below for your ease.
10/10/22, 19:30 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!
10/10/22, 20:43 - Unknown: Have you gone through the above activity?
11/10/22, 19:01 - Unknown: Greetings, Proud Edoofian
I hope that you are in good health and spirits

Let us start Today’s morning with this motivational quote by Mason Cooley
Procrastination makes easy things hard and hard things harder.

I believe that you would also agree with this, right?
11/10/22, 19:03 - Unknown: Also, Caroline, I believe it has been a week now since we started with our African School Education Reform Mission Project.
May I know if you have made any progress in that because I was expecting some forms so that I can schedule the calls.

Please let me know if you are facing any hindrances while doing this.

Have you read the messages that I shared with you yesterday?
12/10/22, 19:27 - Unknown: Also,
Proud Edoofian, May I know when will you be submitting the Saturday's Activity?
It is already way past the deadline
13/10/22, 18:50 - Unknown: Greetings, Proud Edoofian
I hope that you are in good health and spirits

Let us start Today’s morning with this motivational quote:
He who asks a question is a fool for five minutes; he who does not ask a question remains a fool forever.
13/10/22, 18:50 - Unknown: Yesterday, I asked you to submit last week's Saturday Activity. The deadline for that was Tuesday 6 PM but I gave you a leeway.
But don't you think, This is a bit unfair?
Due to the delay, You also missed out on the Wednesday lesson that I was not able to share with you due to the pending last two submissions.

Today, At all costs, I would need the submission for the Last week's Saturday Activity.
I am sharing it below.

After that, I am sharing this week's Wednesday Lesson which you have to submit on Friday by 6 PM.

We can not allow ourselves to at a such mediocre pace.
13/10/22, 18:50 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.
13/10/22, 18:52 - Unknown: Now, I am sharing Last week’s Saturday Activity below:

Hope you are doing well. This week we learned about one of the most popular yet grounded people who used social media as a tool to become an educator and give back to the community and still become an entrepreneur.
This week I want you to reflect on what your strengths and skills are to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 

These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content etc.
Please share these skills and instances where you were able to showcase these skills in your next session.
