15/11/23, 19:13 - Ruvimbo EWYL23E0875: Greetings Ms. Aditi, I am Ruvimbo Chinogwenya and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is EWYL 23E0875.
16/11/23, 11:39 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings of the day!

Hope you are well,
I hope you are all excited for this journey, on this note since you completed your initial orientation yesterday, I am sharing this week's Wednesday wisdom with you so that you do not miss out on anything.
16/11/23, 11:39 - Aditi Kapoor: Wednesday wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

16/11/23, 13:39 - Aditi Kapoor: You can share those on your EWYL Group.
16/11/23, 13:43 - Ruvimbo EWYL23E0875: OK thank you mam
16/11/23, 13:45 - Aditi Kapoor: Could you please share your strategy or plan for working on the projects?
16/11/23, 13:52 - Ruvimbo EWYL23E0875: On the first project I'm still on reaches and I got some of the contacts of other Managers so I'm looking forward to contact the I have other relatives who work in such companies they insisted on helping me so I'm looking forward to their responses. 
In project number 2 I contacted my peers from different schools and they are also helping advertising  and sharing the group link of the group I created.  I'm also looking forward to advertise on our youth events  also. 
On project number 3 I was able to connect with our school head she seemed interested . At the moment I'm in search of other schools head's contacts from my peers from different school. I was also planning in visiting nearby schools in my area and advertise about Edoofa.
16/11/23, 13:54 - Aditi Kapoor: That's fantastic progress on all fronts! It's impressive how you're strategically reaching out to various contacts and utilizing both professional networks and family connections for support.
In Project 1, leveraging the contacts of other managers and involving your relatives who work in similar companies is a great strategy. Their assistance can provide valuable insights and open up opportunities.
Project 2 seems to be gaining momentum with your peers actively participating and helping spread the word. Utilizing youth events for advertising is a clever move, tapping into a relevant and engaged audience.
Connecting with your school head for Project 3 is a significant step. If she's interested, it could potentially create a positive domino effect. Exploring contacts from peers in different schools and planning to visit nearby schools is a proactive approach to expanding your outreach.
It's clear you're putting a lot of thought and effort into each project. How do you feel about the progress so far, and do you have any specific challenges or areas where you'd like additional support or ideas?
16/11/23, 13:56 - Ruvimbo EWYL23E0875: Thank you mam .

20/11/23, 13:44 - Aditi Kapoor: Saturday activity is a special one as the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!
For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.
By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.
Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.
Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!
20/11/23, 13:47 - Ruvimbo EWYL23E0875: OK mam noted
20/11/23, 13:47 - Ruvimbo EWYL23E0875: OK thank you
20/11/23, 13:48 - Ruvimbo EWYL23E0875: OK let me do so
20/11/23, 13:48 - Aditi Kapoor: So I am looking forward to hearing about your experience.
20/11/23, 13:49 - Ruvimbo EWYL23E0875: OK mam
20/11/23, 14:13 - Ruvimbo EWYL23E0875: When my form four results came out  I had performed well and I was looking forward to do my A level in boarding school where I was before  but at that moment things were very tough and hard at home. We had a financial crisis There was no option left for me than to just learn at a local school. To be honest I was so hurt because  changing the environment  walking a distance to go to school it was all new. But I want to thank God that I quickly  accepted the situation and I took advantage of it  that I created time for extra lessons after school. To be honest I didn't let all that affect me and to be honest  I really did learn a lot and my circle of friends extended and I also got time to  spend with my family. It was also a great opportunity because my peers from my local school are the ones who introduced me to this program Edoofa.The school I was completing my A level at made me more determined  because I got this desire to improve a lot on my schools. My wish is to sponser it and increase a lot of buildings there which is what keeps me going till today.
20/11/23, 14:14 - Aditi Kapoor: Ruvimbo, your resilience and positive attitude in the face of challenges are truly admirable. It must have been a significant adjustment to switch to a local school due to financial constraints after performing well in your form four exams. Your acceptance of the situation and your proactive decision to make the best of it by engaging in extra lessons and expanding your circle of friends demonstrate a remarkable mindset.
20/11/23, 14:15 - Ruvimbo EWYL23E0875: Thank you mam
20/11/23, 14:20 - Aditi Kapoor: You're welcome!
20/11/23, 14:21 - Aditi Kapoor: Alright, this is it for today's session, we will meet in our next session with renewed enthusiasm.🤩
