18/07/22, 17:36 - Admire EWYL20E0164: Fast growing industries in Zimbabwe

Mining gold:,   Despite being battered here and there by price and currency concerns gold still represents one of the big growth industries for Zimbabwe. The openness to artisanal miners makes entry into gold possible for the majority. The mineral remains important and the foreign currency earnings, though only 55% make it very attractive. Fidelity printers recently announced further incentives for gold producers with bonus payments so that may spur growth further in the sector. Gold mining is now becoming one of the major industry in which its relying to boost and stabilize its economy.

19/07/22, 01:19 - Admire EWYL20E0164: Strengths in mining gold 
It brings direct and indirect jobs, gold mining also brings foreign direct investment and tax revenues to countries. Often operating in remote locations, gold mining companies invest in infrastructure and utilities.

Weakness:

Environmental effects , ,  mining can occur at local, regional, and global scales through direct and indirect mining practices. The effects can result in erosion, sinkholes, loss of biodiversity, or the contamination of soil, groundwater, and surface water by the chemicals emitted from mining processes.
19/07/22, 01:27 - Unknown: Admire, Let me first help you understand what SWOT Analysis is.

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment.This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organizations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
19/07/22, 01:46 - Unknown: As seen above, SWOT is an acronym of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. However, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym:

1 Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
2 Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
3 Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
4 Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by

19/07/22, 19:46 - Unknown: Hello Admire! how are you today? 
Good to see you are following the ritual, Keep it up.
19/07/22, 19:46 - Unknown: Now continuing our conversation Admire,  You know why SWOT Analysis is important? It can help you to challenge risky assumptions and to uncover dangerous blindspots about your organization's performance. If you use it carefully and collaboratively, it can deliver new insights on where your business currently is, and help you to develop exactly the right strategy for any situation.
19/07/22, 19:46 - Unknown: For example, you may be well aware of some of your organization's strengths, but until you record them alongside weaknesses and threats you might not realize how unreliable those strengths actually are.

1 Making your lists too long. Ask yourself if your ideas are feasible as you go along.
2 Being vague. Be specific to provide more focus for later discussions.
3. Not seeing weaknesses. Be sure to ask customers and colleagues what they experience in real life.
4. Not thinking ahead. It's easy to come up with nice ideas without taking them through to their logical conclusion. Always consider their practical impact.
5 Being unrealistic. Don't plan in detail for opportunities that don't exist yet.
