21/05/23, 11:30 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Here we are with our weekend activity, it has been some time since we are talking about leadership, and styles of leadership and have even learnt a lot about our leader from Edoofa. It goes without saying that leadership is a skill that one acquires over time and with continuous effort to acquire this characteristic. The EWYL programme, each project and task that is assigned to you, is a direct place for you to practise this skill. This weekend, sit with yourself and write about how you can use the EWYL programme to master the skill of leadership and make a plan for which projects you will prioritise to be a leader in the student community. How will you ensure that your name is on the next list of student leaders for the Edoofa student community? Some of the students have already been recommended as Student Leaders by the mentors; how will you ensure that your name is on the next list of student leaders for the Edoofa student community?
Since a detailed plan is required, the minimum word limit for today‚Äôs activity is 150 words.

The last day to submit your responses is 22-05-2023 and don‚Äôt forget only the responses shared here on the dedicated EWYL line will be evaluated.
21/05/23, 11:30 - Jasmine Kaur: Also, We have partnered with a company called UPSURGE, which focuses on financial literacy for kids and making them financially smart. The project has been assigned to around 60 students in India.

I trust this message finds you in high spirits. I wanted to inform you that I have been fully dedicated to the preparations for the upcoming event in Zimbabwe. With its magnitude, and hosting over 1000 students, it promises to be an extraordinary affair.

I kindly request your understanding and support during this time, as my focus and attention are directed toward ensuring the success and smooth execution of this significant event. Your understanding in this matter is greatly appreciated.

24/05/23, 11:56 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Morning dearüòÑ
I hope this message finds you well.
I wanted to let you know that as you are aware that our founders are currently in Africa, and we have been occupied with organizing a Meet and Greet event in Zimbabwe. Consequently, I have been quite busy making all the necessary arrangements.

Additionally, in honor of Africa Day, we are planning to visit our students at their respective universities and join them in celebrating this special occasion. I hope you will appreciate the importance of these engagements.
24/05/23, 11:57 - Jasmine Kaur: Also, I would like to let you know that since we were unable to connect on Monday, I have scheduled a one-hour session today from 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm. I hope to see you in the session. Kindly be present and also before the session starts, make sure you submit your Saturday activity on the EWYL Line.
24/05/23, 12:55 - Michael EWYL22E1280: *I am a Proud EDOOFIAN.*
24/05/23, 15:41 - Michael EWYL22E1280: Good afternoon Ma'am I'm ready for the session. I'm sorry I am late. My training at the gym took longer than expected.
24/05/23, 16:19 - Jasmine Kaur: Ahhh Nice. So, are you preparing yourself for coming to India or do you usually like to workout?
24/05/23, 16:26 - Michael EWYL22E1280: Both actually. I want to gain 8kg of mass so that I can have the healthy height to weight ratio. Right now I am a bit underweight by 5kg. Since my body doesn't grow big by eating more food, I lift weights instead.
24/05/23, 17:07 - Jasmine Kaur: You have so much knowledge about this. It's good to see. 
Here is your lesson of the week
‚ÄúWhen I discover who I am, I'll be free.‚Äù ~ Ralph Ellison.
In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.

You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.
I hope you enjoy this lesson, learn more about your own self, and find your self-introspection switch.
Happy Learning.

Deadline - 26th May 2023

31/05/23, 13:34 - Michael EWYL22E1280: I understand that I am introvert. I am more in my head in my own head than I am social. Part of the report from the personality test said I am an intelligent person, and I totally agree and even my siblings will agree, they even call me the family nerd for that sake. This is secret few people know, during my A level I spent the money I was given for extra lessons on other things. I didn't go for extra lessons because I knew that with exceptional "understanding" I would pass without going for extra lessons.
It's true that I believe I should never stop learning and that I enjoy learning new information but only in one particular field namely *science and technology.* All things like hypercars, supercars, aeroplanes, rocket science, aerodynamics, pyrotechnics, astronomy, electronics, toxicology, gastronomy, guns, forensic science a bit of human biologyand *many others,* these are the things that exhilarate me, that I mostly want to talk about, that make my pupils dilate and capture my full attention. All things other than the aforementioned üòë,   nope. If only my house was a library and I had all the time in the world. Oh my God, am I a nerd and I even wear glasses? üò≥

SATURDAY ACTIVITY
Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week‚Äôs Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better‚Äîtogether. It‚Äôs why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger‚Äîas successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!

06/07/23, 11:20 - Michael EWYL22E1280: I do have a personal experience related to consistency. Achieving my fitness goals; it requires a lot of consistency for you to achieve your physical goals. It took a lot of time for me before I began seeing good results, I even felt demotivated along the way but I had to be consistent to get where I am. I used to be very skinny but now I'm at a point where my mind goes like üòéüòé whenever I look at my body in the mirror. I still have a long way to go and I need to be *consistent* to achieve my ultimate fitness goals. As one Instagrammer once said: *"motivation keeps you going, but consistency keeps you growing"* ‚úä.

06/07/23, 13:04 - Jasmine Kaur: Good morning Michael, I am so happy to see you on time. While I go through your lesson. I want you to give me an update on your Community Building project.
06/07/23, 13:21 - Michael EWYL22E1280: A lot of the people, *like almost everyone* I'm informing about Edoofa has either been already enrolled into Edoofa or has been enrolled by another program. Yesterday I went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get my documents authenticated for my visa application, I met someone there who I went to school with 7 years ago. And he was there for the same reason as me. He was also enrolled into Edoofa and I was like "whaaaat me too". And I also realised that 13 other random people who were also there were enrolled into Edoofa and were there for the same purpose. Even on Thursday last week when I went to the Zimbabwe School Examination Council _(ZIMSEC)_ to get my certificates certified _(also for my visa application)_ I also met a bunch of random people there who were *all* enrolled by Edoofa also there to get their certificates certified. Everywhere I'm going I cross paths with an Edoofian.
06/07/23, 13:22 - Jasmine Kaur: It's wonderful to hear that you recognized the importance of consistency in your fitness journey. Often, progress in any area of life takes time, and it's during those challenging moments when consistency becomes even more crucial. There may have been times when you felt demotivated or faced obstacles, but your commitment to consistency allowed you to push through and continue working towards your goals.
06/07/23, 13:22 - Michael EWYL22E1280: A lot of the people, *like almost everyone* I'm informing about Edoofa has either been already enrolled into Edoofa or has been enrolled by another program.

And he was there for the same reason as me. He was also enrolled into Edoofa and I was like "whaaaat me too". Too bad we weren't enrolled into the same university. And I also realised that 13 other random people who were also there were enrolled into Edoofa and were there for the same purpose. Even on Thursday last week when I went to the Zimbabwe School Examination Council _(ZIMSEC)_ to get my certificates certified _(also for my visa application)_ I also met a bunch of random people there who were *all* enrolled by Edoofa also there to get their certificates certified. Everywhere I'm going I cross paths with an Edoofian.
06/07/23, 13:24 - Jasmine Kaur: Wow, that's great.
06/07/23, 13:25 - Jasmine Kaur: It shows how big our community is growing.
06/07/23, 13:28 - Michael EWYL22E1280: It's growing exponentiallyüìà.
06/07/23, 13:29 - Jasmine Kaur: That's true!!!!!
06/07/23, 13:29 - Jasmine Kaur: Now coming back to the EWYL PROGRAM. Which project are you working on Michael?
06/07/23, 13:37 - Michael EWYL22E1280: But I have a plan. When I get there I'll make videos of my experience and share them so that other people can see for themselves how amazing it is to be studying in India rather than to be just told by mouth that it's wonderful this and that. *It's very hard to appreciate the beauty of something unless one sees it with their own eye(s).* For instance let's say I'm told that there's a beautiful lady whom I can marry, I'll obviously want to see that lady for myself before I decide on marrying her. The same concept applies here.

You know what they say: *"seeing is believing."*
