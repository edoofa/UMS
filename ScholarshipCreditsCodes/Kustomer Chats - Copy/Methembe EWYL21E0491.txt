it's is important to first change your mind set and always maintain a positive mind setwhich will inturn change the way you feel and give you the energy to work..
And also it's important to try new things to take risks everyday and not wait for the perfect moment . That's is forgetting luck and living by intent . Good things will only happen when you are in the grave

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

In today's lesson, we will discuss how to build our capacity to multitask, manage our time and prioritize our daily tasks in order to have it all. 

Let's dig right in, and understand how if you follow these steps, you will be able to manage your exams, assignments, extra curriculars, and your EWYL projects all at one go. After going through this, you must discuss the plan of action to execute these steps with your mentors.

Happy Learning!
