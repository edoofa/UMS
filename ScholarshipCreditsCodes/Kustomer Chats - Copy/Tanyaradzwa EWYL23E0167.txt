 As we witness the remarkable progress in AI, we ponder its potential to transform our lives and simultaneously question if it will replace us
16/11/23, 12:42 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0167: It has the potential to do both just requires careful management to make sure it helps us for the better
16/11/23, 13:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Good morning Tanyaradzwa!

20/11/23, 14:17 - Saloni Rastogi: 1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.​
20/11/23, 14:18 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0167: Why not energy solutions
20/11/23, 14:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Since we are an education based organisation, we believe that these companies would not be add to any skill/knowledge within our students.
20/11/23, 14:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Also our aim is to look at student-centric companies.
20/11/23, 14:20 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0167: Oky understood

I kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let me know.
