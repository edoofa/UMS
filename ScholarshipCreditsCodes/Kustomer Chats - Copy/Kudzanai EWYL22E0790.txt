How are you?

As part of your Saturday submission, I want you to answer the following questions in detail:

1. What are the key factors that have contributed to the success of NetFlorist, and how have the Bacher brothers' vision and dedication enabled them to build South Africa's largest online gifting company?
2. Additionally, what skills would you like to master in order to be successful in your professional journey?

In today's session, we will discuss:
1) Weekend activity
2) Projects
07/03/23, 21:23 - Kudzanai EWYL22E0790: 1. The key factors that have contributed to the success of the Netflorist are innovation, customer centricity and hard work. The brothers' vision and dedication to build their company was driven by their continued focus on innovation and customer service.
 2. The skills i would like to master inorder to master to be successful in my professional journey are problem solving, professionalism, leadership, digital technology and critical thinking.
07/03/23, 21:41 - Saloni Rastogi: You know the opinions of both question will completely differ with students but one common thing is that they strive to move ahead in life and take this motivation to next level. I have heard one quote on it, let me share it with you:
''One of the best ways to achieve career success is to keep assessing your performance. Don't wait for your annual appraisal – do it yourself. An ideal way to do this would be to identify quantifiable goals and set a timeline for achieving them. Start with setting short-term goals when you're new to a job.''

Your response just reflects how passionate you are about your journey in the EWYL Program with me.

Ready for today’s Wednesday Wisdom?

Have you ever wondered what the one governing principle that governs all businesses might be? What is the name of the one value that every company considers to be crucial? Have you ever heard of something called the North Star Metric?

North Star Metric is a key business metric that reflects the core value a product delivers to its customers. It's a single, actionable metric that aligns all efforts towards achieving long-term growth. Let us learn about in greater detail, read the lesson carefully and we will connect in our upcoming scheduled session. 

Till then Happy learning!

10/03/23, 20:47 - Kudzanai EWYL22E0790: Greetings of the day to you too
I am well how are you?
10/03/23, 21:14 - Kudzanai EWYL22E0790: I have challenges concerning the task from the Wednesday wisdom
10/03/23, 21:14 - Kudzanai EWYL22E0790: I don't understand what I'm supposed to do exactly
10/03/23, 21:43 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing good, thank you.
10/03/23, 21:44 - Saloni Rastogi: For the Wednesday lesson, it was all about the North Star metric. You were supposed to share with me what all you learnt about it and how do you relate that with your EWYL Program, it's targets and scholarship credits associated with it.
10/03/23, 21:45 - Kudzanai EWYL22E0790: Okay
10/03/23, 21:46 - Kudzanai EWYL22E0790: Well I have learned that NSM is the one metric that captures the core value that your product delivers to customers
10/03/23, 21:50 - Kudzanai EWYL22E0790: And with relationship to my EWYL program I have seen that my NSM is that how I tag catch up with my  targets and how much I earn in a certain period of time
10/03/23, 21:57 - Saloni Rastogi: When setting direction to success you must make good choices on the path you are going to choose. 
Setting goals is the most important thing you can do in your life.
For us, the North Star Metric is achieving the target of 15 forms at least a week and earning about $50 a month.
10/03/23, 22:11 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, I see you have formed the group on the community building project, but there are two challenges:
1) You are not updating the group daily
2) there is no increase in the number of participants
May I know the challenges on these?
10/03/23, 22:12 - Kudzanai EWYL22E0790: Okay
10/03/23, 22:13 - Kudzanai EWYL22E0790: How do I update the group daily?
10/03/23, 22:15 - Kudzanai EWYL22E0790: 2.And I should say convincing people that the scholarship is genuine is so difficult since I'm still in Zimbabwe especially after telling them about the sums of money I've paid
10/03/23, 22:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Kudzanai, I am failing to see the group that you created for the community building project, can you add me?

13/03/23, 16:18 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”
