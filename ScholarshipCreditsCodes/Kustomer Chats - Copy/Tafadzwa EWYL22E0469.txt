30/01/23, 19:42 - Jasmine Kaur: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.

31/01/23, 00:28 - Jasmine Kaur: May I know your EWYL group name, please?
31/01/23, 00:32 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay
31/01/23, 00:33 - Jasmine Kaur: Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say

02/02/23, 00:39 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

Happy Learning!

04/02/23, 00:46 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0469: yes let‚Äôs discuss please
04/02/23, 00:46 - Jasmine Kaur: I would like to inform you that these are automated messages that you receive. Automated text messaging is one of the easiest ways to stay connected with our large student community and acts as an affirmation of our identity as proud Edoofian. Isn‚Äôt it?
04/02/23, 01:10 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0469: wow that‚Äôs a good thing
04/02/23, 01:10 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0469: how can l also make my Automated messages
04/02/23, 01:16 - Jasmine Kaur: You do not have to make them Tafadzwa
You would also agree that time is important to everyone, and we realised that close to 70% of discussions had fallouts due to slow responses. Since I have more than 100 students who I am mentoring at the moment, I like to be personally invested in each one‚Äôs growth. I was facing a challenge in addressing each and everyone timely. But I wanted to make sure at least each one receive a reiteration of our proud identity from my end as well. Therefore, It was strategically decided to use technology to help us in maintaining our sense of community, keeping our spirits high, and also ensuring I have a maximum time in my day to focus on your skill development and sessions. So we thought of using technology for assistance and hence the idea of using automated responses.
04/02/23, 01:59 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0469: that‚Äôs a really great idea ..?
04/02/23, 16:03 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0469: I Am a Proud Edoofian
