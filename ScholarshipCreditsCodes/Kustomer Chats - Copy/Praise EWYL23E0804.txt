15/11/23, 14:04 - Praise EWYL23E0804: WEDNESDAY WISDOM
15/11/23, 14:33 - Jasmine Kaur: Happy Wednesday! ðŸŒŸ
Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

Good afternoon,
I trust this message finds you well. My name is Praise, and I am reaching out to you at what I hope is a convenient time. I am interested in discussing a scholarship program that holds significant benefits for both your school and its students.

Have a great day as well.
17/11/23, 19:11 - Praise EWYL23E0804: Have a great day Ms Jasmine
18/11/23, 14:49 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one â€“ it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
18/11/23, 17:12 - Praise EWYL23E0804: My name is praise Mateo.  When I was in lower six I faced so many challenges as a new comer at Monte Cassino girls high.  I had no friends, used to walk alone and I also felt intimidated by the girls because truly Monte Cassino girls are intelligent.  I felt like I was going to be a failure in the class . With no true friends, I had a poor social life . Not only those were my challenges, academics also became my challenge because I felt pressured by the work we were given which was hard , sleeping at 11 pm doing maybe 5 pure mathematics questions , I mean seriously sleeping that late doing 5 questions? But when we then wrote our mid year examinations, I was the best student in Accounting.  It is something that shocked the old comers as to how a new comer could get a prize for Accounting despite being new in the school . Since that second term I knew I had to keep my game up so that I wouldn't fall from grace to zero because surely it was going to be embarrassing.  Since then I fought though academics were hard I had to finish, the cala thing as well I had to push through and I did . My social life didn't get any better but I didn't let that obstruct me from achieving my goals because I knew anyway I was going to separate from these people at the end .
