Adaptability.
One needs to understand that things are going to and on challenging projects it's considered to be norm than usual. You need to be flexible and willing to change and take risks if there is need to.
*Collaboration*. One needs to be able to listen and work with the team and also the project sponsor. There must be the process map for the project, how it's going to be carried out and the key points and then you  can get it out and show people, using it to help them understand the work. Collaboration and teamwork  are considered to be one of the top project management competencies you need to be able to excel at any challenging project.
*Communication*. Process mapping is a good project communication tool. You need to be transparent and share on how the project is going to be carried out. The team's confidence must be boosted and be sure of what they are doing. There is need create as much visibility as possible. 
*Expertise.* one needs to be at some level of expertise before managing a really large project. If the project is quite challenging one is advised to turn to his project mentor for more problem solving skills than sitting around and mess up because of lack of humility. 
*leadership.* one needs to be a cheerleader and mostly a servant leader. You need to be listening, persuasive, aware, foresight, empathetic, commitment, stewardship and look at a bigger picture.
12/07/22, 21:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Captain!
How's your day going?
12/07/22, 21:27 - Saloni Rastogi: I am really glad to hear your understanding of the activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY* . They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost up, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.
12/07/22, 21:28 - Saloni Rastogi: Rest we will discuss your inputs in the session tomorrow.
13/07/22, 18:39 - Captain EWYL21E0523: I am a proud edoofian
13/07/22, 18:41 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

14/07/22, 22:43 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my proud EDOOFIAN!

From his dad’s small foray into entrepreneurship, Patrice Motsepe got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe’s success story is a remarkable one showing how curiosity, doggedness, perseverance, and the knack to exploit great opportunities as they come, can determine how successful or not, any individual could become. 
And this was all about our WEDNESDAY WISDOM.
Hope you have gone through it.
I am so excited to listen to your thoughts and views here.
15/07/22, 02:14 - Captain EWYL21E0523: The life story of Patrice Thlopane is so amazing and awe inspiring.
15/07/22, 02:15 - Captain EWYL21E0523: He was so adamant about his dream of doing a mine business and he would acquire knowledge all the way and never give up eventhough he became a lawyer instead he increased in knowledge and his curiosity and perseverance made him one of the best entrepreneurs in Africa now.
16/07/22, 04:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings CAPTAIN!
16/07/22, 04:21 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your response NAME and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a WAY. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. We can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.

I hope you are doing well.
SWOT analysis might sound something complex but I am sure that while going through our weekend activity, you might have gone through what a SWOT means thoroughly and gained much knowledge on the same. The weekend activity asked us to draw a SWOT analysis of any company.
I want to share your response with me here Captain.
18/07/22, 21:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Each day I become so happy seeing your fervor and passion for our daily ritual, keep going.
18/07/22, 22:08 - Captain EWYL21E0523: Thank you
18/07/22, 22:09 - Captain EWYL21E0523: Weekend task.

Despite being battered here and there by price and currency concerns mining industry still represents openness to artisanal miners makes entry into mining industries possible for the majority making it the fastest growth industry in Zimbabwe and contributing much to economic growth since it's inception. SWOT analysis is as follows.
*strengths* mining industry has huge mineral resources. There are different resources available on the earth to go for. Global policies across industry. Because of plenty resources available, Zimbabwe ofen export the mineral resources that they have mostly and import the mineral resources that they require. Integrated planning. The gap between the operational sites and software technology can be fulfilled by integrated planning and optimization. Skilled resources, sustainability, operational efficiency and cost savings.  Pursuing opportunities and maximising the positive effects in the operational sites and integrating sustainability principles to improve the processes to pursue growth and adding values to the mining industry can lead to the operational efficiency and cost savings. 
*weaknesses* risk management, poor communication across stake holders, regulatory constraints, schedule constraints, business interruptions and current innovation deficit. Inadequate risk management due to many internal and external factors like unplanned events at mining sites can cause serious loss of productions. Inadequate process and quality management due to resource constraints, schedule constraints can delay material supply. Inefficient communication and stakeholder management may arise and this may break transparency and honesty in the stakeholder relationships. Frequent strikes,carelessness at mining sites,lack of trained people and frequent equipment failures can cause business interruptions. 
*opportunities* focus on innovation, technology development, capability development, local joint ventures, merger and acquisiti

21/07/22, 04:17 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your response to your weekend activity and it made me so inquisitive to know about the mining industry I got to know that predominant minerals mined by the industry include platinum, chrome, gold, coal, and diamonds. The country boasts the second-largest platinum deposit and high-grade chromium ores in the world, with approximately 2.8 billion tons of platinum group metals and 10 billion tons of chromium ore.
Your response is so elaborative and impressive and it provided me with so much knowledge.
21/07/22, 04:17 - Saloni Rastogi: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader. 
Also Captain, along with the SWOT analysis of a company, I would appreciate it if you also share a SWOT analysis of yourself. I want to see how much more you have learned beyond this activity.

Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

*Growth mindset of successful people*

They understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. They don't necessarily think everyone's the same or anyone can be Einstein or Newton but they believe everyone can get smarter if they if they work at it. They will interpret failures and challenges as opportunities to grow and cultivate their existing qualities and talents. They strive for self improvement and are also aware of their flaws  and shortcomings and hence welcome new challenges and perceive failures positively. Growth-oriented individuals understand that  the harder they work the more tenacity, positive view  toward hardships and the more successful they will be. 
*how to develop this growth mindset*
You can develop the growth mindset by changing your bad habits and focus on the process more than the results, the key to success is not giving up on a problem but overcoming it. You need to to commit to a goal plus setting a schedule, showing up and sticking to it. You also need self awareness and self compassion, they help understand and balance their weaknesses, nurture their desire to grow and eventually empower you to become happier in life...

Life lesson i learnt is that *the more problems you solve the more successful you will be and the more problems in the world, the more business exists. Search for problems and find solutions and then you will begin to find attraction to your value*
25/07/22, 23:34 - Captain EWYL21E0523: Hello maam
26/07/22, 17:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

Yesterday I had an amazing day. I went to the airport to receive all my proud Edoofians and I had tears in my eyes seeing their happiness and enthusiasm. I want you to look at it and share your thoughts with me.
26/07/22, 17:34 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your understanding of the activity and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it’s not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you’re looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don’t do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.
