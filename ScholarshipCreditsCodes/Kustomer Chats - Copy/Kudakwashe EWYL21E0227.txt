l want to thank the Edoofa team for all that they do because i couldn't have done this without them , iam forever grateful and honored. 

This scholarship allows me to concentrate on the most important factor of school, EWYL projects. 

As a Zimbabwean , l have come to fully appreciate the value of college education in India after having gained various experience.

l can continue to keep focusing upon excelling in my course work and not to have wory much about will l have money to pay the remaining tuition as there is EWYL program .

*l commit to use these years wosely and work harder through the EWYL*
01/11/22, 01:36 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
01/11/22, 01:39 - Unknown: Glad to hear from you Kudakwashe! Let's make this ritual a habit and move toward a better and brighter future, together.

02/11/22, 23:23 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We all have come across the quote, \"Quitters Never Win, and Winners Never Quit\", and we also must have experienced this in our lives, directly or indirectly.

If last week's lesson, taught you the mindset of a winner, this week's lesson is going to teach you the true nature of a winner. Someone, who never gives up, or quits on the dream they see and really want to fulfill, no matter what. Moving through scorching heat, drenching rains, and heavy snow, they reach their destination and complete their journey. In this lesson, you will also learn, what happens when an entire community inherits this trait and keeps working on it. How recognition is earned and respect is gained through time, patience, and endless efforts.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.
03/11/22, 01:31 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0227: *Do you think you have given your all to master these projects*

 I am a highly motivated, result-oriented individual, willing to go an extra mile to reach goals and learn along the way.

My skill set is a perfect match for the projects. In particular, my unique skills make me an ideal candidate for the EWYL projects.
03/11/22, 17:16 - Unknown: Greetings My Dear Proud Edoofian! Let's connect at 2 pm Zimbabwe Time for our session.

03/11/22, 23:14 - Unknown: Great Kudakwashe! So can you please share your understanding of the Wednesday lesson with me?
03/11/22, 23:29 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0227: the most valuable lesson i learnt is that  winners never give up .... looking at the story of Siddis who were brought to India in the 12th century by the Portugals for work and how they ended up becoming rulers of certain states and communities in India. 

this story taught me than there is more other than just doing my education in india  ....  the sky is the limit  in everything , the goal is to show people that success is not about race , either african or or other race , yu can become the next C.E.O or manager of any company by setting yourself to the right skills and knowledge
03/11/22, 23:40 - Unknown: I am really happy with your understanding Kudakwashe! So, as the lesson suggests, can you please share with me the problems you feel, can hinder your success in the projects or education?
03/11/22, 23:46 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0227: ok ... the main challenge l noticed often is that most people here can't speak or understand english .....  language barrier is problem in this case
03/11/22, 23:48 - Unknown: So, have you thought of a way to deal with it?
03/11/22, 23:49 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0227: yes sir absolutely...... lam gonna have to learn Hindi too in some cases
04/11/22, 00:00 - Unknown: I really appreciate your thought, but your projects would mostly be based in your country, and community building, how have you thought of tackling those difficulties, now when you are in India?
04/11/22, 00:13 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0227: well in that case sir  i find the problem to be less challenging as companies based in zimbabwe use English language frequently .....  ...... though l might   find some difficulties  in time management with academics and projects .......   never the less , lam also planning to schedule my time so that i can balance the two
04/11/22, 00:52 - Unknown: Great attitude Kudakwashe! So, I want you to now share with me a target that you would try to achieve every week in your projects, so that we can work systematically on it.

04/11/22, 01:07 - Unknown: Great Enthusiasm Kudakwashe! But I want you to set numbers for every project you are going to try and achieve.
04/11/22, 01:19 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0227: 2-3 projects a week are optimal for my focus and collective scheduling.

05/11/22, 01:25 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0227: Community building means creating and maintaining a network of relationships between people who share common interests. Community building can take many forms, from online communities to offline meetups and events.


hence the reason why i have set a goal of completing 2 is because  l find it beneficial for myself to boost my confidence and learn certain skills from other people
05/11/22, 01:27 - Unknown: I really appreciate your understanding Kudakwashe! But, I want you to focus on also, spreading the word among your friends, neighbors, and students, whom you think are deserving of the kind of opportunity to study abroad, as you have received.

05/11/22, 21:42 - Unknown: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian!

“My job is not to be easy on people. My job is to make them better.”- Steve Jobs

And till now, our founder Mr. Angad has always been a guiding light for everyone at Edoofa. And has made sure we all turn out to be future leaders in our fields, no matter how hard it seems, we should keep moving with single harmony toward our goals and motives. But, leadership can not only be taught, as it is not a literary subject, but a practical life experience that is to be taken up and practiced and bettered with each passing day.

Hence, after the very encouraging Wednesday lesson on how good leadership and patience can change the entire ideology and perception of a community to grow back from the ashes. Today's Activity is going to give you a first-hand experience to fit yourselves in a small part of the leadership shoes. I want you to create a newsletter of your own. Similar to the ones you have enjoyed reading every Sunday from the founder's office.

Your Newsletter should consider the following things:  Quotes that have been motivating you for some time now, or your three favorite quotes which motivate you to be better every day.
and,
2. One story of your idol, that can be any person, who according to you has contributed to making the community and world a better place for people to live. The story should also consist of a part stating the reason why they are your idol.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own capabilities while performing this activity.

The best newsletters of the week shall be shared with all the fellow edoofians next week.

Have a wonderful weekend ahead.
05/11/22, 22:11 - Unknown: The deadline for the submission of this newsletter is 12 pm Zimbabwe Time Monday.

Being honest, the journey towards the academic accomplishment and subsequently towards this scholarship was not easy; in fact it was very long. lot of work has been done. Transforming the idea to the real output required a good deal of efforts and various challenges came in the way. I was not alone though, I had my colleagues who walked along with me and my mentor who provided unconditional support to me. Above all, I am thankful to the Board members of edoofa.
07/11/22, 23:13 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0227: hello sir !
07/11/22, 23:14 - Unknown: Greetings Kudakwashe! How are you?
07/11/22, 23:14 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

I am fortunate to start my journey as an edoofian and offer my services to this institution. This institution and its incredible mentors  have taught me everything I know today.

 The fun part of it all was the challenge which seemed difficult but always taught me new ways to deal with a problem or a new environment. It feels really great when we see our efforts give great tangible results. And it was a matter of time and constant work and perseverance to get here.

I have always worked hard and tried to get my best grade. I have done pretty well in school and am trying my best in college. I try to develop better study habits and work efficiently.

09/11/22, 21:13 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0227: it was excellent.... i learned a few things during the session
09/11/22, 21:15 - Unknown: Can you please share your experience and learnings from the webinar?
09/11/22, 22:07 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0227: ok so to begin with , Ms Nyasha shared her journey life story from college upto where she is right now ....  she did two different carriers that is medicine and   media prod casting . She was promoted as acting brand advertising manager at SPAR Zimbabwe ??. Ms Grace also worked for petroleum company in that same field of advertising marketing. 

Her dream was to go hollywood and become a new rising star as a prodcasting media practitioner but unfortunately she was denied a VISA.

At some people , Ms Grace lost hope to archive her goal  dream of becoming a story creator and teller and going on-stages.  Never the less , she was a self driven lady who knew what she really to do for her life . In that case , she never gave up and kept believing in her self and now  she is a Marketing & media specialist..... 

*my learning outcomes*

in life yu must do what you really want the most and let no one discourage you from doing it. Ms Grace  did medicine but it wasn't her goal at , she always wanted to be a story teller because thus where most of interest were invested to .

let me also share my story 

back when l was doing Ordinary Level , i did Technical drawing as one of my subject and i was very good at that . That made me realise that my strength is in architecture design and drawing.  Unfortunately l was transferred to a new boarding school in marondera at Form 3 and had to do Agriculture as practical because TG was not available. \"This is the end of it \", i thought to my self . At  that time i lost that dream which i was busy chasing . 

Moving on , i passed my Olevel well and started Alevel at Harare High .  To my surprise, TG was amongst the Alevel subjects. lt was pretty obvious that i would take Technical Graphics as one of my combinations but unfortunately they denied  it , and kept discouraging me to choose TG . l just moved on and never wanted to here anymore of TG again because l had lost hope.

l passed my Alevel well again a

09/11/22, 23:24 - Unknown: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian,

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.

11/11/22, 01:05 - Unknown: That is the words of the pdf Kudakwashe! I want you to be comprehensive in your own thoughts!
11/11/22, 01:24 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0227: For self aware individuals like Mr Obama , their actions are guided by their beliefs and values. in general , beliefs and values are central to out core identity, which shows that self aware individuals are able to live their lives aligned  with those beliefs .

\"Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.\" ~ Bruce Lee

In this week's Wednesday lesson, you learned about the different sorts of personalities a person carries, but only a true leader is one who understands their personality and can do wonders with its power. In today's activity, I want you to dig deeper into your own consciousness and learn more about the kind of personality you are. As I believe, the more you know yourself, the clearer your vision of the world and your mind gets. Below is a link to a personality test, which you shall be taking up this week, and then would be sharing the results via a screenshot to your mentors by Monday. You can then read and understand more about your results by discussing them with your Mentor.

This particular exercise is going to give you an insight into the kind of person you are so that you can use your strengths to yield the maximum benefits in whatever work you take up.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own personality while performing this activity.

Have a wonderful weekend ahead.

Deadline -  Monday.

It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
