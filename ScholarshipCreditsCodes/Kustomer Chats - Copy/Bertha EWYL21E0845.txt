How are you?
09/10/22, 16:04 - Aditi Kapoor: Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. Those unfamiliar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.
Responses will be accepted on the *EWYL Line* only.
_Till then keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'_.

Happy learning and enjoy your weekend!

13/10/22, 00:58 - Aditi Kapoor: Are you facing challenges?
13/10/22, 00:58 - Aditi Kapoor: We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real-life example. That is how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because in the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.
Responses will be submitted on the EWYL Line only.

Happy Learning.

How are you?
18/10/22, 23:32 - Aditi Kapoor: This week I want you to reflect on your strengths and skills to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 
These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content, etc.

In the session on the *EWYL Line*, we will discuss:
1) your social media skill
2) video about becoming the face of EDOOFA-information about the same will be given only when you will share the weekend activity understanding with me
18/10/22, 23:33 - Aditi Kapoor: I am happy to see you following the daily ritual with so much dedication and zeal. :fireworks:

How are you?
20/10/22, 20:38 - Aditi Kapoor: I am happy to tell you that this weekend we are having our great Indian festival, Deepawali and you know this festival holds a special place in the hearts of all Indian families. So yesterday, everyone in our office wore Ethnic dresses and celebrate Deepawali's party where we exchanged gifts and lit up the office with diyas and candles.
Due to this, there was a delay in sending you the Wednesday lesson for this week.
Please see to it and we will have a session tomorrow on the same because I want to give you time to ponder and work on it.
20/10/22, 20:38 - Aditi Kapoor: In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

14/07/22, 14:51 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
