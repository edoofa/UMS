02/05/23, 13:22 - Takudzwanashe chigwaya: *Wednesday wisdom*📓 

So from the previous Wednesday wisdom l have learned how one will become successful as stated bt Napoleon Hills in his "think and grow big "book.

As stated by will as mastery💪 of procrastination,l have leant that being very good and very fast at decision making it will help you being successful . One needs to trust him/herself because those who make decisions very quickly are the ones who get the job done in the intended time without procrastinating

Hills also suggested that when will power is combined with persistent then one can achieve his/her goals since most people lacking that will power will easily give up when things gets difficult.

Also Hills also said the power of the monster mind 👨‍👨‍👦‍👦is essential.one may have plans which will aid him in being successful bt a very talented master mind group with help input knowledge into the plans thereby making one achieve their goal,that is why he suggested that the efforts of a collection produces results that are much greater that those of parts

The subconscious mind 🧠as stated by hills he created an metaphor for himself which stated that thoughts attached with emotions are like yeast if you feed the subconscious mind negative thoughts then it will negatively affect the bread but if it is fed positive thoughts it will produce a great result on the cake🍰 , meaning always staying away from negative thoughts will aid you into becoming successful . using affirmation to input positive thoughts into the subconscious will make it mull to positive thoughts and enabling one to always think positive also preventing procrastination.

Overcoming fear is also one thing that Hill stated as being a factor that leads to success. Hills outlined six types of fears.he also stated that one must not have drawbacks if he/he is in pursuit of success💪.

02/05/23, 21:06 - Aditi Kapoor: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.

Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell:

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges.
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
 3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above

12/05/23, 13:31 - Takudzwanashe chigwaya: *Wednesday wisdom* 📙
 *Belonging As An Ability*
 
My own understanding of the previous Wednesday wisdom is that belonging is the ability to connect with others and creating relationships👨‍👩‍👧 so that one can feel accepted and valued😌 .
I have learned that one can create relationships through joining social group or organizations .one must create strong relationships as they are very important in personal and academic growth.
The creation of relationships and one being true to these relationships can create a sense of belonging and also unity👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.

Lastly l also understood the efforts being made by the Edoofian student community to gather students from diverse culture and nationalities and bringing them together so that they attain their personal and academic growth 👩🏾‍🎓
