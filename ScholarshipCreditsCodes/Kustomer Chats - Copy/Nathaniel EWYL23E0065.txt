The EWYL programme, each project and task that is assigned to you, is a direct place for you to practise this skill. This weekend, sit with yourself and write about how you can use the EWYL programme to master the skill of leadership and make a plan for which projects you will prioritise to be a leader in the student community. How will you ensure that your name is on the next list of student leaders for the Edoofa student community? Some of the students have already been recommended as Student Leaders by the mentors; how will you ensure that your name is on the next list of student leaders for the Edoofa student community?
Since a detailed plan is required, the minimum word limit for today‚Äôs activity is 150 words.

The last day to submit your responses is 22-05-2023 and don‚Äôt forget only the responses shared here on the dedicated EWYL line will be evaluated.

22/05/23, 16:51 - Jasmine Kaur: Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Alex who loved playing the piano. Despite facing financial hardships, he practiced on an old, worn-out piano every day. His passion and dedication led him to enter a prestigious music competition.

Now, it's time for a quick quiz to test your comprehension of Alex's motivational story:

What did Alex's passion and dedication lead him to?
a) Winning a sports competition
b) Receiving an art scholarship
c) Participating in a theater production
d) Entering a prestigious music competition
22/05/23, 17:03 - Nathaniel EWYL23E0065: d

29/05/23, 17:26 - Jasmine Kaur: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above

05/06/23, 18:18 - Nathaniel EWYL23E0065: *#Ô∏è‚É£I am a PROUD EDOOFIAN* Experience
The meet and greet session was an educational event for me ,it was also a joyful event experience to meet with the founders and them sharing their experiences and wisdom to us enlightened me to become a better person.This event also made me to meet with my fellow Edoofians with whom we shared different and similar visions for the future.
This event was made so as the students can share their ideas,experiences and also ask many things they didn't understand. It gave all the Edoofian coordinators leadership,confidence skills as they were the ones who were to make sure that the event was an organized event and also that the event was going to be a joyful for everyone. The session made us as Edoofians to meet with the founders of the Edoofa scholarship program and learn from their wisdom and experiences.This session made me to realize that as a student I should be someone who explores different things so as to grow big and be successful.From the wisdom of the founders I learnt that India shared the same colonial master with Zimbabwe but it has grown to be 3rd in the world of the most developed country. This made me realize that there is need to work hard and get the best prize. India has the best educational system as compared with other European countries.
05/06/23, 18:18 - Jasmine Kaur:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, Let me share a small story with you!

It's time for our exciting Saturday activity! üéâ This week, we dived into the captivating world of entrepreneurship, exploring the remarkable stories of four inspirational entrepreneurs. I'm confident that you have thoroughly researched and read about each of them in detail.

Now, I invite you to reflect on the entrepreneurs we discussed and share your favorite among them. In 200 words, I encourage you to highlight two similarities and two dissimilarities between yourself and your chosen entrepreneur.

So, take your time, think deeply, and express your thoughts in a well-crafted 200-word response. Feel free to share your insights, and let the inspiration from these entrepreneurs propel you towards your own entrepreneurial dreams.

20/06/23, 13:49 - Nathaniel EWYL23E0065: From the various Zimbabwean entrepreneurs that l  have read them from the Wednesday wisdom, i have understood  from each and everyone of them.
They all did a great hard work to archive all that, so it motivates me towards my upcoming future, especially to get rid of my goal. 
From the founder of SECURICO, Devine Ndhlukula, i have learnt  that success builds from the smallest goals we have and propelling towards them even if it means we have to start small. The growth of SECURICO from 4 employees to a thousand really proves that no matter how small we may begin, we need to keep on aiming for that goal.And really had passion and for what needed as to make the dream come trueFrom the founder of Kingdom Bank, Nigel Chanakira, he went to being the owner of the largest institutions in the country because of the special skillset of identifying opportunities and taking calculated risks. Taking calculated risks and being able to identify opportunities is a key factor for my personal growth as a student as it helps me along my career lines to achieve success.

From Ruvheneko Parirenyatwa, i have learnt that sometimes success needs to be a persuasion of ones passion rather than other people's goals.
From Shingi Munyeza i have picked up the concept of diversity, being envolved in various and diverse industries is a great way of being more successful as various industries might fall while some rise thus allowing you to stay comfortable in between.

28/06/23, 18:56 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!
