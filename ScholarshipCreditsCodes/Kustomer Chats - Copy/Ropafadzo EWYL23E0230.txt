So this time you have to be *REGULAR IN YOUR SESSIONS*


Before we begin, let's go over what a complete session involves. 📚
29/06/23, 16:21 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0230: Following
29/06/23, 16:22 - Ananya: ▪️ First of all, you have to *come to the EWYL LINE every single day and tell me HOW PROUD ARE YOU being an Edoofian* (Including Sundays and even on days you don't have your session). This means _following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' without fail on the EWYL Line._

▪️ Secondly, It's essential to *arrive on time for the session*, as being late will not be considered as attending a session. _This brings the importance of being punctual for the session._

▪️ During our sessions, we'll cover two key topics: the *Wednesday Lesson or Weekend Activity* and *Project Updates*
29/06/23, 16:25 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0230: Well noted
29/06/23, 16:25 - Ananya: To ensure your progress, I will ask for your Lessons or Activities submissions during the session. It's essential to be prepared and ready to share your work when prompted.🎓

29/06/23, 16:45 - Ananya: Great. Now coming to the point that you might have also noticed and something that brings a flavor to this challenge is Extra Curricular activity


When it comes to overall assessment and evaluation, we believe it's not just about projects and lessons. It's about how passionate you are about yourself. Therefore, there is another aspect for evaluation, which is extracurricular activities.

In the next 21 days, It's your turn to show your amazing talent and be better than all the other students in this thrilling competition. Show everyone what you can do and make them amazed by your skills.

As your mentor, I want you to tell me about what else you are good at besides academics and share your idea of how you will showcase that talent to us.
29/06/23, 16:47 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0230: Well l find myself being good at taking responsibility so l will show this by doing my best in this challenge
29/06/23, 16:53 - Ananya: That's wonderful, Ropafadzo, that you are responsible. However, it's important for you to showcase your talent to distinguish yourself from other students. It's a simple task, as many of my students have already done it. However, you need to have an additional talent that can make you stand out from the crowd.
29/06/23, 16:56 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0230: Noted
