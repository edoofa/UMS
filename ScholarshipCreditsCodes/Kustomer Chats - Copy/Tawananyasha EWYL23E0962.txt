I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.

21/12/23, 15:49 - Ananya: Good afternoon, Tawananyasha!

Let us begin our session with a thought! Have you ever wondered why Santa doesn't get a parking ticket on Christmas Eve? It turns out he has 'Sleigh Parking Only' privileges and his reindeer are excellent at navigating the skies without worrying about traffic laws. It seems Santa's got connections in high places ‚Äì or should I say, the North Pole!" üéÖ‚ú®

Here's to the memories etched in the canvas of 2023, a testament to resilience, growth, and the power of education.
27/12/23, 13:27 - Ananya: Why are you late, Tawananyasha?
27/12/23, 13:36 - Tawananyasha EWYL23E0962: My network isn‚Äôt stable
27/12/23, 13:36 - Tawananyasha EWYL23E0962: I sent the msg long back
27/12/23, 13:36 - Tawananyasha EWYL23E0962: Good morning I sent the documents I received from the people who were interested
27/12/23, 13:46 - Ananya: Alright, Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
27/12/23, 13:47 - Tawananyasha EWYL23E0962: Wow tts a big turnover in jus a short period of time
27/12/23, 13:56 - Ananya: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey‚Äîhow he initiated and scaled his business to such heights.
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
27/12/23, 13:59 - Tawananyasha EWYL23E0962: I guess it was with the help of the EWYL program
27/12/23, 14:03 - Ananya: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn‚Äîhe started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
27/12/23, 14:05 - Tawananyasha EWYL23E0962: Wow tt was really smart of him
27/12/23, 14:12 - Ananya: For Raghav, LinkedIn was about connections but you know you can do more with this tool, like :
27/12/23, 14:12 - Ananya: *Career Exploration:*
Students can use LinkedIn to explore various career paths by following companies, organizations, and professionals in their chosen industries.
Access to diverse profiles and career journeys can help students make more informed decisions about their own career paths.
*Job and Internship Opportunities:*
Employers often use LinkedIn to post job and internship opportunities. Students can leverage the platform to find relevant openings and apply directly.
Building a strong LinkedIn profile increases the likelihood of recruiters discovering and reaching out to students for potential opportunities.
*Showcasing Skills and Accomplishments:*
LinkedIn allows students to showcase their academic achievements, skills, and extracurricular activities on a professional platform.
This can be an effective way to differentiate oneself from peers and demonstrate qualifications to potential employers.
*Researching Companies and Industries:*
Students can use LinkedIn to research companies and industries they are interested in. Following companies provides updates on their activities, culture, and job openings.
Staying informed about industry trends and company developments is crucial for making informed career decisions.
*Learning from Professionals:*
Following industry leaders and professionals on LinkedIn allows students to stay updated on industry trends, insights, and thought leadership.
Engaging with relevant content can contribute to continuous learning and provide valuable perspectives.
27/12/23, 14:12 - Ananya: *Building a Personal Brand:*
Crafting a professional LinkedIn profile helps students build a personal brand online.
A well-curated profile, including a professional photo, a compelling headline, and a well-written summary, can make a positive impression on recruiters and potential connections.
*Recommendations and Endorsements:*
LinkedIn allows users to receive recommendations and endorsements from professors, colleagues, or supervisors.
Positive recommendations and endorsements can add credibility to a student's profile and provide evidence of their skills and work ethic.
*Joining Professional Groups:*
LinkedIn offers various professional groups and communities where students can engage in discussions, ask questions, and stay updated on industry news.
Joining these groups can expand a student's network and provide valuable insights into their chosen field.
*Long-term Career Planning:*
LinkedIn is not just for immediate job searches but can also be a tool for long-term career planning. Students can set up job alerts, follow companies for future opportunities, and stay connected with their network even after graduation.

27/12/23, 14:17 - Ananya: So, do you have a LinkedIn account? If yes, could you please share the link with me? I would like to review your profile and suggest some improvements if necessary.
