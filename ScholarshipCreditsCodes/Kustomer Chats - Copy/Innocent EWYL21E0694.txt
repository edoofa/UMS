Something went wrong with my former account can we please continue our sessions on this line from now on
23/07/22, 06:47 - Innocent EWYL21E0694: I am a proud Edoofian\"
23/07/22, 06:48 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

23/07/22, 20:40 - Unknown: Hello Innocent, How are you doing today?
23/07/22, 22:55 - Innocent EWYL21E0694: I am fine Sir how are you
25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:35 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

I have a request.
I am asking you to form a platform were we can constantly check our credits.A platform that is always updated each time you successfully complete a project.
I guess that will motivate us to work more.
For me it is that unnecertainity that demotivates me.
Once i am certain that whatever efforts i make recompense even spending sleepless nights becomes worth-it.

06/10/22, 18:51 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians,

So we know, a lot of you have been keeping busy these days with your exams and academic curriculum. And while we wish you all the luck for it, we don't want you to miss out on your learning and skill building. In today's lesson, we will discuss how to build our capacity to multitask, manage our time and prioritize our daily tasks in order to have it all. 

Let's dig right in, and understand how if you follow these steps, you will be able to manage your exams, assignments, extra curriculars, and your EWYL projects all at one go. After going through this, you must discuss the plan of action to execute these steps with your mentors.

Happy Learning!

Let us start Today’s morning with this motivational quote by Mason Cooley
Procrastination makes easy things hard and hard things harder.

I believe that you would also agree with this, right?
11/10/22, 22:13 - Unknown: Are we connected, Innocent?
12/10/22, 18:34 - Innocent EWYL21E0694: Yes , i agree.
Good morning to you?
12/10/22, 19:23 - Unknown: Great!
Proud Edoofian, May I know when will you be submitting the Saturday's Activity?
It is already way past the deadline
13/10/22, 18:30 - Unknown: Greetings, Proud Edoofian
I hope that you are in good health and spirits

Let us start Today’s morning with this motivational quote:
He who asks a question is a fool for five minutes; he who does not ask a question remains a fool forever.
13/10/22, 18:30 - Unknown: Yesterday, I asked you to submit last week's Saturday Activity. The deadline for that was Tuesday 6 PM but I gave you a leeway.
But don't you think, This is a bit unfair?
Due to the delay, You also missed out on the Wednesday lesson that I was not able to share with you due to the pending last two submissions.

Today, At all costs, I would need the submission for the Last week's Saturday Activity.
I am sharing it below.

After that, I am sharing this week's Wednesday Lesson which you have to submit on Friday by 6 PM.

We can not allow ourselves to at a such mediocre pace.
13/10/22, 18:30 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.
13/10/22, 18:44 - Unknown: Now, I am sharing Last week’s Saturday Activity below:

Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!

25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
27/07/22, 03:40 - Innocent EWYL21E0694: Weekend Assignment
Accountability

This is being responsible , answerable to something or to an action.
The weekend activity precisely pointed out that accountability is a key prerequisite for success .
Successful people are responsible for all their outcomes.They don't blame anyone for their failure.
This is very true ! Many people waste time playing the blame game for problems that require solutions .
Once you don't tackle a problem with the accountability mentality , its obvious you will find someone or something to accuse the accused will always find means to defend himself by shifting the blame. At the end the problem is not solved rather hatred and strife is created .

Holding yourself accountable is the best way to solve a problem.I want to share a story were the theme of accountability prevailed .
During my A level course I was the Economics class representative .
Being a class rep entails that one should take the responsibility of issuing and safe keeping any study material for the subject .
During the final examinations I was tasked to distribute revision guide text books to the class.
After the examinations I had to follow up to ensure everyone returned the books .
I listed the name of those who didn't return the books .
I carried the books and records to the teacher however I could not find her because she was busy with invigilation.I decided to leave the books at my friends' house who lived near the school , so that I will return them when I come to take my results. When results came out I travelled to school with all hopes that I will go and take the books I left at my Friend's house.
Hell broke loose when I arrived at his house only to discover he was not there more also the books were a jamble in his room.
A mixture of the books from grade one books for his younger brother to the university modules of his bothers.I tried to search for the Economics revision guides and records but it was all in vain .I was angry , the first

11/08/22, 22:07 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
