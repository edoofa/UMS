25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

02/08/22, 15:35 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

04/08/22, 05:06 - Unknown: Hello my proud edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Today's Wednesday lesson is providing us with the details of how a 19year old started his journey of a successful business and today has a majority market share in Zimbabwe, handling brand portfolios worth over $870 million. After you have read the pdf carefully share your major takeaways and the inspiration you got from Gilbert Eugene Peters. 

Happy learning!
05/08/22, 23:16 - kundai EWYL22E0028: The inspiration l got from Gilbert Eugene Peters is that believe in yourself when noone else does not believe in you and eventually you will make it. Another lesson is that age does not matter in the entrepreneurial journey .And also entrepreneurship is not a straight road and success in this journey is often achieved through sweat and blood .Of course there will be obstacles but one needs to add focus to make it in this journey .Some hindrances will lower your confidence but if our hearts can believe it and our minds can conceive it then we can achieve victory ...

07/08/22, 19:35 - Unknown: Greetings Kundai!
How's your day going?
07/08/22, 19:35 - Unknown: I am so happy to see you following the daily ritual so consistently.
07/08/22, 19:37 - Unknown: Reading your response Kundai filled me with so much fire, passion, and motivation. It got reminded me of one quote:
“If you want to be happy the whole life, tie it to a goal, not people or objects.”

This was the quotation given by Alert Einstein and the quote which gives the definition of a goal.
Through this lesson, my main motive was to teach you that sacrifices are required to achieve the main target, and achievement of those important aims is necessary.
Those aims are:
1. Analysis of my strength and weaknesses – because this analysis will let me know that how to work on both to make my strength more powerful and convert my weakness into my strength.
2. To be a good person and love yourself – To get positive vibes one should work on herself\/himself because “when you see yourself clearly, with eyes full of love and acceptance, you hold space for others to meet you at your highest self “(by Karly Ryan).
3. Never regret any past decision – “Every bad decision gives you a lesson and this makes one’s vision more clear towards the achievement of its goal” as it is said by a great personality that takes responsibility and initiative for yourself stop blaming your circumstances for what you can change.
4. Always give 100% – there is a frame on my living room wall, of Swami Vivekananda that always gives me motivation the quotation written in it says “Arise, awake, and do not stop until the goal is reached”.
07/08/22, 19:44 - Unknown: I would like to share something about my goals.
My goals also consist of making my parents proud of their daughter, a daughter that will give them a more comfortable life, one that is not filled with such pain. Indeed, I cannot deny that truly I am not experienced as much as some people, but at least for me, every milestone in my life is an emblem of my growth. When I can complete something new successfully or learn something from my failure instead of complaining, I think I have grown up.
07/08/22, 19:45 - Unknown: For better communication and elaborative discussion, I want to give you my undivided attention in our session.
For that I have decided to keep batch timings:
Since your batch is scheduled on TUESDAY and FRIDAY, I have two slot options for you (the one you choose  will be valid for both days)
*SLOT 1*-11:30 AM-01:00 PM (Zimbabwean Time)
or
*SLOT 2*-01:00 PM-02:30 PM (Zimbabwean Time)

This will be valid from TUESDAY (09\/08\/2022) onwards in all our coming sessions.
08/08/22, 06:30 - kundai EWYL22E0028: 1-2.30 will do

09/08/22, 22:34 - Unknown: Greetings Kundai!
How's your day going?
09/08/22, 22:34 - Unknown: One can be called successful if they have achieved their desired goals. For some people, being successful means being rich. But being successful is even more than being rich. When you achieve what you want, it gives you immense pleasure, and that is incomparable with being rich. To be successful in any aspect of life, one needs to have strong dedication and work hard. 
Our WEEKEND ACTIVITY discussed the traits of a successful person.
So, in our session today, we will:
1. discuss your understanding of the weekend activity.
2. make weekly plans on achieving targets on three ongoing projects.
09/08/22, 22:34 - kundai EWYL22E0028: It is okay
09/08/22, 22:34 - kundai EWYL22E0028: How is yours?
09/08/22, 23:26 - Unknown: I am doing great, thanks for asking.
09/08/22, 23:27 - Unknown: Please share your understanding Kundai, I am very excited to discuss with you.
09/08/22, 23:39 - kundai EWYL22E0028: While being successful means being rich to others,it may also mean the achieving your dreams and goals as an individual.After achieving your goals the great feeling coming from that is nothing compared to being rich...the self satisfaction you get cannot be compared to having a lot of money.Also hard work and dedication lead to one being successful
11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off
