14/07/22, 02:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Sure Tinashe.
25/07/22, 03:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 00:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Due to some medical emergency, I would not be able to take your session today.
But, nothing to worry about, I will do better after some time.
And by the time we have our next scheduled session, I want you to keep following the proud edoofian ritual.
Till then, have a great day.​
​And yes, we have our cultural festival tomorrow, named Raksha Bandhan. I want you to search for it, and if it gains your interest, we will surely discuss it in our next session.
11/08/22, 00:52 - Tinashe EWYL21E0029: Thank you......noted
11/08/22, 22:09 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

How are you doing today?
12/08/22, 18:12 - Saloni Rastogi: So yes, did you do a quick research about Raksha Bandhan?
You know I had an amazing day yesterday. First I put a red spot on my brother's forehead, it is called 'teeka'. Then we stick some rice to that spot and after that, I tied a beautiful decorative rakhi (a thread or ribbon) on this wrist.
Sisters do that for the long life of their brothers and to that, the brothers promise to protect their sisters.
Later we have delicious sweets. :food:
12/08/22, 18:12 - Saloni Rastogi: What do you think about this?
12/08/22, 18:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Also tell me, Tinashe, you told me that you have arranged for a new phone.
I want to ask whether the data has been recovered, do you have all our chats, documents, audios, or previous lessons?

Your session will be held on tomorrow as per our schedule since the organization is observing an off today on the eve of our religious festival, Dussehra.
Once I come back on Thursday for your session, I want that you get some research done on what is Dussehra and why it is celebrated, we will surely discuss it in our session on Thursday along with your Wednesday lesson response, which will be very much exciting?

How are you doing?

As students, we constantly learn and expose ourselves to situations that help us learn anything and everything, but we must remember that each of us has the same number of hours in a day. Hence we must treat it important that we treat our Time as the currency of life. *Time Management* is essentially Priority Management.

In our session today on the *EWYL Line*, we will discuss:
1. How managing time is necessary
2. pending session on the weekend activity

Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.
Responses will be accepted on the *EWYL Line* only.
_Till then keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'_.

That is how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth.
