Share your favorite motivational quotes in the comments and let's inspire each other to conquer this week together!
21/12/23, 12:58 - Ananya: Good morning, Patience!

Let us begin our session with a thought! Have you ever wondered why Santa doesn't get a parking ticket on Christmas Eve? It turns out he has 'Sleigh Parking Only' privileges and his reindeer are excellent at navigating the skies without worrying about traffic laws. It seems Santa's got connections in high places ‚Äì or should I say, the North Pole!" üéÖ‚ú®

21/12/23, 13:12 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
21/12/23, 13:45 - Patience EWYL23E0870: Thank you üòä,i am looking forward to this amazing journey
21/12/23, 13:47 - Ananya: Patience, why are you late?
21/12/23, 13:50 - Patience EWYL23E0870: My apologies ,My phone is as on charging
21/12/23, 13:51 - Ananya: Alright, to begin with, I believe we should start something that aligns with your interest. So, may I ask, which one is your favorite project: the community building or the African reform mission?
21/12/23, 13:53 - Patience EWYL23E0870: That will be Community building
21/12/23, 13:55 - Ananya: Lovely! So can I know your progress on that project?
21/12/23, 13:57 - Patience EWYL23E0870: I'm,talking to a few students who sound interested and I'm almost done creating a group
21/12/23, 14:03 - Ananya: Great! Now, tell me how are you going to search for some potential students for your community-building project.
21/12/23, 14:07 - Patience EWYL23E0870: Im thinking of reaching out to former students from my school and from other schools as well
21/12/23, 14:08 - Patience EWYL23E0870: I've asked those im in touch with already to tell their friends as well
21/12/23, 14:11 - Ananya: Amazing, now I also have a few ideas! Would you like to know?
21/12/23, 14:14 - Patience EWYL23E0870: Yes please
21/12/23, 14:15 - Ananya: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:
21/12/23, 14:15 - Ananya: *Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
21/12/23, 14:15 - Ananya: *Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
21/12/23, 14:18 - Patience EWYL23E0870: Thank you very much, I'll do my best to reach out to the students
21/12/23, 14:20 - Ananya: Well, trust me patience it's right time to proceed, as you know 2023 is wrapping up. Don't you think we should kick off the new year with something big? How about committing to earning a specific amount of scholarship credits?

After all, you wouldn't want to head to India empty-handed.
I'm saying this from my own experience ‚Äì having some credits before you arrive in India isn't just a benefit for you; it's a help for your parents too. Not only this, we often pick students for internships and personal training based on their credits and regularity in the EWYL journey.

Believe me, you've got plenty of time right now being in your home country, so don;t you think we should utilize this time with our utmost dedication?
21/12/23, 14:23 - Patience EWYL23E0870: Yes we should exactly why im working now to earn those credits i wouldn't want to burden my parents
21/12/23, 14:26 - Ananya: Absolutely, I've finalized a few students for a 30-day challenge, and I want you to be a part of it. I need you to attend the sessions dedicatedly and put in the hard work for your EWYL projects.

Moreover, I'll set specific targets for you, and I want your commitment to work diligently to achieve them. As your mentor, I'll be there to guide and support you every step of the way. Is that alright with you?
21/12/23, 14:27 - Patience EWYL23E0870: Yes it is
21/12/23, 14:31 - Ananya: Amazing! Let's set a new target for you. For the first 10 days out of the 30, I want you to focus on connecting with two schools and getting eight students to submit their offline application forms.

If you encounter any challenges during this time, reach out to me immediately because we need to achieve this target. I expect you to give it your best effort.
21/12/23, 14:32 - Patience EWYL23E0870: I'll do my best ma'am üòÅ
21/12/23, 14:33 - Ananya: Great! We have to conclude our session for today. I wish we could have proceeded for a longer time, but that's alright as we will connect again tomorrow!

27/12/23, 13:19 - Patience EWYL23E0870: üòÖüòÖ

Sure we may go ahead
27/12/23, 13:26 - Ananya: By the way, Patience, you do not have to share this whole message every time. You can just follow your ritual of saying, 'I am a proud Edoofian.'
27/12/23, 13:26 - Patience EWYL23E0870: Oooh okay , thanks
27/12/23, 13:34 - Ananya: Well, during our last session, we set a target for you. Would you like to share your progress with that? I also want to know how you are proceeding with it, as it will help me understand your challenges, and then I can assist you in a better way.
27/12/23, 13:37 - Patience EWYL23E0870: I haven't been able to find someone who is serious about applying and most of the students i found had already applied i have two im waiting on their response they said their discussing with their parents .
27/12/23, 13:47 - Ananya: Alright, can I know where are you searching for the students?
27/12/23, 13:51 - Patience EWYL23E0870: I used WhatsApp groups of former a level students and church groups
27/12/23, 14:02 - Ananya: That's great! You know, many of my students are facing a challenge in proving the authenticity of the program. Do you also face such kinds of challenges?
27/12/23, 14:08 - Patience EWYL23E0870: I haven't yet ,but just in case, what do you suddenly
27/12/23, 14:08 - Patience EWYL23E0870: ***suggest ?
27/12/23, 14:13 - Ananya: So, for the people who do not trust us, you can opt for the following things:
Share our weekly newsletter with them, where they can see the Edoofa Hall of Fame.
Share your university offer letter with them.
You can also share our Edoofa Instagram page.
Additionally, did you know that the First Lady of Zimbabwe took time during her visit to India to meet the CEO of Edoofa? How can this be a fraud?

Here's to the memories etched in the canvas of 2023, a testament to resilience, growth, and the power of education.
28/12/23, 13:15 - Patience EWYL23E0870: Morning miss Ananya,we may begin
28/12/23, 13:18 - Ananya: Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
28/12/23, 13:22 - Patience EWYL23E0870: ü§©woow that's nice,im sure it took hard work and determination to start a company üòÉ
28/12/23, 13:30 - Ananya: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey‚Äîhow he initiated and scaled his business to such heights.
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
28/12/23, 13:33 - Patience EWYL23E0870: Can't, please tell
28/12/23, 13:36 - Ananya: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn‚Äîhe started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
28/12/23, 13:39 - Patience EWYL23E0870: That's inspiring,i always thought building a company required a kit of connections .i have a better understanding now üòÉ
28/12/23, 13:39 - Ananya: You know, we are working on financing our education through the projects and we will improve, but being your mentor I also want to ensure that you pass out not only with traditional peace of paper but with a lot of exposure and success.

So, for today, let's take a page from Raghav's book. Be proactive, build connections, explore opportunities, and turn LinkedIn into a tool that propels your dreams. If he can, why not you?
28/12/23, 13:41 - Patience EWYL23E0870: Yeah sure
28/12/23, 13:42 - Ananya: For Raghav, LinkedIn was about connections but you know you can do more with this tool, like :
28/12/23, 13:42 - Ananya: *Career Exploration:*
Students can use LinkedIn to explore various career paths by following companies, organizations, and professionals in their chosen industries.
Access to diverse profiles and career journeys can help students make more informed decisions about their own career paths.
*Job and Internship Opportunities:*
Employers often use LinkedIn to post job and internship opportunities. Students can leverage the platform to find relevant openings and apply directly.
Building a strong LinkedIn profile increases the likelihood of recruiters discovering and reaching out to students for potential opportunities.
*Showcasing Skills and Accomplishments:*
LinkedIn allows students to showcase their academic achievements, skills, and extracurricular activities on a professional platform.
This can be an effective way to differentiate oneself from peers and demonstrate qualifications to potential employers.
*Researching Companies and Industries:*
Students can use LinkedIn to research companies and industries they are interested in. Following companies provides updates on their activities, culture, and job openings.
Staying informed about industry trends and company developments is crucial for making informed career decisions.
*Learning from Professionals:*
Following industry leaders and professionals on LinkedIn allows students to stay updated on industry trends, insights, and thought leadership.
Engaging with relevant content can contribute to continuous learning and provide valuable perspectives.
28/12/23, 13:42 - Ananya: *Building a Personal Brand:*
Crafting a professional LinkedIn profile helps students build a personal brand online.
A well-curated profile, including a professional photo, a compelling headline, and a well-written summary, can make a positive impression on recruiters and potential connections.
*Recommendations and Endorsements:*
LinkedIn allows users to receive recommendations and endorsements from professors, colleagues, or supervisors.
Positive recommendations and endorsements can add credibility to a student's profile and provide evidence of their skills and work ethic.
*Joining Professional Groups:*
LinkedIn offers various professional groups and communities where students can engage in discussions, ask questions, and stay updated on industry news.
Joining these groups can expand a student's network and provide valuable insights into their chosen field.
*Long-term Career Planning:*
LinkedIn is not just for immediate job searches but can also be a tool for long-term career planning. Students can set up job alerts, follow companies for future opportunities, and stay connected with their network even after graduation.
28/12/23, 13:53 - Patience EWYL23E0870: Thank you .. how do you create a strong profile for LinkedIn
28/12/23, 13:54 - Ananya: You can refer to this video!
