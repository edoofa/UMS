01/02/23, 19:39 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

Happy Learning!

Ready??                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

The feedback we have received from some of you on this week’s Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.
As part of this week’s Saturday Activity, you are required to share your written submission on : 
What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?
There is no word limit, so feel free to express your understanding in detail. The second answer requires some mental work, so sit with yourself, introspect, and share your honest answer with your mentor. 
Let this activity play an important role in your personal goal setting. We will connect soon in our upcoming session.

16/03/23, 21:18 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0853: Yes l went through the lesson you sent 
It really encouraged me a lot
16/03/23, 21:21 - Unknown: Yes indeed it is quite an interesting topic and have you read about the part of Wealth and Money? Tell me what you have understood from it
16/03/23, 21:48 - Tinevimbo EWYL22E0853: Well its true that many people thinks that the pursuit of wealth,money and status will bring happiness and fulfillment .Thats why day in day out we see people going to work, its not bad  for one to go to work. The lesson emphasise that in reality the pursuit of these things brings stress anxiety and also depression why because one will be trying to have money 
According to what l understood after reading the lesson is we should seek wealthy not money or status because wealthy provides a sustainable path towards financial stability and success.Wealthy is defined as having assets that earn while you sleeping 
I also understood the key to building wealthy that is focus on creating assets that guarantee passive income 
Money is important cause its used as a way of exchange that is its a tool that is used to transfer time and wealthy.So we should concentrate our focus on building wealthy and use money to help us achieve financial goals

20/03/23, 17:41 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian!

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!","transform":"
