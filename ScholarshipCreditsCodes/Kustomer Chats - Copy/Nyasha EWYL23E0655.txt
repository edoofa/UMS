We're excited to announce a new and inspiring opportunity for all of you! As part of our commitment to fostering a culture of learning and personal development through our Saturday Activity, we are launching the "Hard Work and Commitment Story week.”
Here's how it works:
*We invite each of you to share a story you've heard or would love to write on the timeless concepts of hard work and unwavering commitment to a goal. This is your chance to let your imagination soar and craft a tale that truly resonates with the values of determination and dedication*
Whether it's a personal experience, a fable passed down through generations, or a fictional narrative, we want to hear your stories. Let your creativity shine, and show us how hard work and steadfast commitment can lead to remarkable achievements.
Draft your story and submit it before our upcoming session. We will have the best stories featured in our student community for others to read and be inspired by.
So, start writing, and let your imagination run wild. Share your stories with us, and together, we can celebrate the values that drive success.
We look forward to reading your stories and sharing your creativity and wisdom.

Best regards,
Team EWYL!
