13/10/23, 13:12 - Unknown: Fantastic! Let's make this session a productive one. To begin, I'd like to share the Wednesday Lesson with you.
13/10/23, 13:12 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's "Wednesday Wisdom" session will delve into the topic of peak performance and the significance of focus in achieving success. We've all heard experts advise us to concentrate, eliminate distractions, and commit to mastering one thing. This guidance is undoubtedly valuable, and the more I study successful individuals from various fields—be it artists, athletes, entrepreneurs, or scientists—the more I am convinced that focus plays a pivotal role in their accomplishments.

Together, we'll explore strategies and ideas that can help you navigate the complex landscape of choices and find your true calling.
Read the PDF very carefully and we will connect in our upcoming session.

Till Then
Happy Learning!

How many community-building forms have you successfully completed, and what is the typical number of students you have engaged with on average?

13/10/23, 13:34 - Charmaine EWYL23E0734: It's difficult to convince people to listen to what you have to say .
For instance I have talked to a few people who seem not to be interested .others think that Maybe the scholarship program is a scam even if you show them enough evidence to prove authenticity
13/10/23, 13:38 - Unknown: Convincing people to listen to your perspective and trust the authenticity of Edoofa scholarship program can indeed be challenging, but there are practical strategies you can employ:
13/10/23, 13:39 - Unknown: Clear Communication: Ensure your message is clear, concise, and well-organized. Explain the benefits of the scholarship program and its legitimacy. Use facts and data to support your claims.

Be Informed: Be well-prepared and knowledgeable about the scholarship program. Understand its selection process, eligibility criteria, and the organization offering it. This will help you answer questions and concerns confidently.

Personal Testimonials: If you or someone you know has benefited from the program, share their success stories. Real-life examples can be powerful in building trust.
13/10/23, 13:40 - Unknown: Address Concerns: If people have specific doubts, take the time to address them individually. This shows your commitment to transparency and your willingness to help them understand.
13/10/23, 13:42 - Charmaine EWYL23E0734: Ok I will apply the above hence forth
13/10/23, 13:42 - Unknown: Here are a few videos that prove the authenticity of the organization. It has the founder of Edoofa Mr. Angad.

13/10/23, 14:29 - Unknown: Now that you have submitted the student application forms/ sooner or later be submitting them for the Community Building Project - 

Please make sure the students are completely aware of what Edoofa is and what it does and even the admission stages.
13/10/23, 14:30 - Unknown: If the student goes to the admission counselor and denies that his/her friend did not discuss anything about Edoofa then *you will not earn any scholarship credits*.

31/10/23, 13:52 - Unknown: Okay Charmaine I can completely understand that. But you have to clarify this thing to everyone you interact with - that Edoofa as an organization does not provide 100 percent scholarship to anyone and everyone. There is a guarantee of 50% of scholarship but rest all depends upon various factors which include one's academic performance, performance in the interview, Letter of recommendation and Statement of purpose and many more.

My motivations I inherit from my family, more specifically my father has kept me going and difficult moment tend to keep me moving forward.We live in a world that is constantly changing and an the future generation,we need to prepare ourselves in order to attain what we want in life.
Memories also late ones of other times go dim ,but memories of how much I have struggled to get were I am right now remain engraved in my mind.They are unchanged.Growing up my parents lived like any other married couple and we survived from the little that my mother who was the bread winner at that moment got.It was never easy as I come third in a family of 3 girls with each one of us needing to be funded for.I learnt that family is the center of the universe and we need to support each other nomatter the consiquences being faced.My parents encouraged us to work extra hard and I have always practiced positive thinking.
I have always loved doing anything to do with technology.My reading has always been superb and I enjoy whenever I read articles be it in newspapers or novels .

I went to high school and life was not easy there but I always told myself not to give up .There was no tension in high school as I mainly focused on getting good grades .Also to include prayer were ever i was in order to stay strong.I got good grades after high school results came out.
 I got enrollment as an Edoofian through the Edoofa scholarship program and am proud to be part of the family.It has been everything that I have always wanted in my life and I hope to archive more while studying abroad.
 
Your dream depends on your hard work and hard work pays .I believe in myself and I will archieve everything I did not get whilst growing up
