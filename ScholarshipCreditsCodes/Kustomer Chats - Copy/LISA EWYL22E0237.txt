19/07/22, 18:25 - LISA EWYL22E0237: The fast growing industry \/sector or business in my country 

I think the fast growing industry in Zimbabwe currently is the Agricultural industry .
It is the only sector according to my research that still has a lot of job opportunities and a wide range of activities to participate in .Due to the high demand of food supply in the country as well as around the globe , l believe it is quite beneficial for an individual to get involved in the agricultural sector. Unlike other businesses you don't necessarily have to find a job but you get the opportunity to be the employer .
Agriculture also as it stands can be considered the back of our country .Economically as much as we have other industries supporting Zimbabwe economically , agriculture remains the main sector contributing to the growth of our nation .
Agricultural activities consists of a wide variety the likes of animal and crop husbandry , horticulture,  agricultural engineering , fishery and many other activities hence it's hold on the economy .
The soil is at large the country's best resource  .

Agricultural industry in the future might face a decline due to the continued degradation of agricultural land buy mining activities and other industries that release poisonous chemicals in to the soil and water bodies .
If conserved and used wisely l believe agriculture will remain the fast growing sector in Zimbabwe

From a personal study l discovered that l have an honest philosophy .
Generally we live in a world of broken promises ,where people can't keep their word and take it lightly but l try to value my words and be a person of less talk and more action 

* I want to develop more my time management as you can never achieve all your dreams without proper time management .I want to be able to do the right thing at the right time and avoid giving myself unnecessary pressure due to failure in managing my time.

*My Role Model*

My role model is my pastor from church who goes by the name Joseph Nyakudya . 

He is a man who does not focus on his weaknesses rather he just brings more of himself in what he does best. He lives his life by choice not by chance and by design and not by default .He doesn't wait to be given his needs on a plater rather he works hard .He is kind to everyone .He says everyone who enters your life has a lesson to teach ,therefore treat them well and your life will be more meaningful.
He practices tough love on himself ,he does what he has to when it ought to be done whether he likes it or not.
He has a way of saying No gracefully when it comes to people that want to shift his schedule and rewrite his priorities for him. He doesn't let other people's schedules get into his planner .

This week we discussed about Personal branding and how it opens up opportunities form an individual and enables them to get the best outcome possible.
19/08/22, 02:06 - LISA EWYL22E0237: Key takeaways from Wednesday wisdom on personal branding

* Personal branding is a way of telling the audience who you are and what you're all about.

*It is important because it stands as a representation of you that is presented to others when they look online and the image you choose to create during facial interactions 

* It's wise to view social media as a site for building a personal brand rather than for social interactions

To build a personal brand :
_you should discover your passion, that  is your likes and interests
_you should also create profiles that reflect your passions 
_ you should also create a development path that is in line with your personal brand
_ you should also be able to tell your story ,what makes you unique from others

15/10/22, 23:12 - Unknown: Hello my dear Edoofians
Hope you are doing well. This week we learned about one of the most popular yet grounded people who used social media as a tool to become an educator and give back to the community and still become an entrepreneur.
This week I want you to reflect on what your strengths and skills are to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 

These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content etc.
Please share these skills and instances where you were able to showcase these skills in your next session.
Till then 
Happy Learning!

17/10/22, 16:42 - LISA EWYL22E0237: Social media skills l have and when they were show cased

*Research skills 
In all of my activities, l always refer to the internet to get more information about whatever l am tasked with and to give more depth to my assignments.

* Social media literacy
We are often given tasks that need us to refer to different social media Apps and platforms and this helps me get more knowledge about social media platforms and how they operate

*Gaining camera confidence
During one of our assignments we were tasked to make videos speaking about study in India 
This helped me get camera confidence because I had to practice over and over again until I felt confident enough to go through the whole video
