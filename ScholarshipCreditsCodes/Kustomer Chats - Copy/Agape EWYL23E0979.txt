22/12/23, 15:52 - Agape EWYL23E0979: Okay noted
22/12/23, 15:59 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you choose between the two options?
22/12/23, 16:03 - Agape EWYL23E0979: The first option
22/12/23, 16:11 - Saloni Rastogi: That is great Agape, may I know how you think you can best work on this project?
22/12/23, 16:16 - Agape EWYL23E0979: I think this one is is much easier to embark on as I work directly with people who want the schoolarship opportunity
Rather than schools 


Zimbabean schools have a high bereacracy As they will tell u to first send the letter to the senior education officials so that they approve u to talk with the head 

I remember when I and my team we were having out business registered after business competition
The school authorities blocked us from advertising our products from free chronicles as they said they are not responsible for any activity that is besides the one in their syllabus
22/12/23, 16:17 - Agape EWYL23E0979: So i think school is a long procedure with high chances of failure from my experience with my school
22/12/23, 16:19 - Agape EWYL23E0979: This also like businesses 


Zimbabean businesses are after profit making and it's hard setting a meeting with them that is not  financial gain to them
22/12/23, 16:26 - Saloni Rastogi: I appreciate that you are using your business acumen and making it worthy by using it for doing the projects. Do you remember Agape, we talked about a technique where we can form a WhatsApp group and add more and more students?
22/12/23, 16:34 - Agape EWYL23E0979: Yes I do remember
22/12/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know if you want me to reiterate the process to you for better clarity?
22/12/23, 16:40 - Agape EWYL23E0979: That would most welcomed so that I do it the exact way
22/12/23, 16:51 - Saloni Rastogi: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
22/12/23, 16:51 - Saloni Rastogi: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*

For eg: In your case, it will be-

Agape/Saloni/22DEC2023*
22/12/23, 16:51 - Saloni Rastogi: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
22/12/23, 16:51 - Saloni Rastogi: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
22/12/23, 16:51 - Saloni Rastogi: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
22/12/23, 16:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
22/12/23, 16:54 - Agape EWYL23E0979: Noted
22/12/23, 16:59 - Saloni Rastogi: So your task for today would be to form the group, name it as I have stated, and add as many students as possible.
22/12/23, 17:00 - Saloni Rastogi: .
22/12/23, 17:54 - Agape EWYL23E0979: Noted thank you
22/12/23, 19:13 - Saloni Rastogi: We will conclude the session for today😌

Only 3 days to go for Christmas🎄, and I am getting chills thinking about how celebrations will be rolling from your end. Being your proud mentor, my heart is filled with joy and optimism🌟. I just want to say that this could be your last Christmas with your family because next year you will be celebrating it with your grand Indian family, and then it will be filled with nostalgia🥺

So, make the most of this time because it won't come back🫶🏻
22/12/23, 19:23 - Agape EWYL23E0979: Ohhh thank you so much Ms Saloni 
Can't wait for the next year's Christmas
22/12/23, 19:28 - Saloni Rastogi: Yeah, me too!
