We recently had a conversation with the university officials and they mentioned that the students are given the time till the10th of September to clear their fee dues, till then no classes would be blocked. 

Before the 10th of September, the founder of Edoofa along with the team would also be coming to the university for student orientation, your mentor will notify you on the same and you can share your challenge with them, they would help you get it resolved. 

With your previous fee structure, I believe you were left to pay $600, have you made the payment of the same by now?

May I know if you were able to find out the factors thad led to their sucess?
25/08/22, 21:08 - Unknown: The Class of 2022, as well as new graduate and professional students, have settled in but many are probably wondering what the next few years holds for them with Edoofa. One key element of Orientation is, as its name implies, getting students going in the right direction. Part of that is feeling welcomed and at home here on campus. Part is learning how to put your best foot forward, regardless of your backgrounds and previous experiences.

We are planning a pre-orientation session because the orientation programme will now take place in the first few weeks of September. This session will be led by Ms. Davi, who will inform you of a few crucial details and have a wonderful surprise in store for everyone of you.

The pre-orientation will take place through Google meet on Friday, 26th August, 7:30 PM IST 

Link:  https:\/\/meet.google.com\/com-cskt-dkp

Kindly join 10 minutes in advance as the session will start exactly at 7:30 PM and students joining post 7:30 PM will not be allowed to join.

I hope that you are doing well

As August Intake is right at our doorsteps, So due to this many of our Edoofians will be arriving here in India to kick start their dream journey.?

I feel that it is my duty to make sure that the university has prepared well for their onboarding process.

This is why I would be visiting the universities Today in order to do a personal check up.
Since, This process would take up lots of time that is why we won't be able to connect Today.
However, I am sure that in my absence, You will make sure that you follow the below given things:

1. Make sure to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual at 9 AM Tomorrow.
2. Do submit the Wednesday Lesson before the deadline.

25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
