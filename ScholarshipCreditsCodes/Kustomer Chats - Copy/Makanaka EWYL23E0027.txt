02/05/23, 12:51 - Aditi Kapoor: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.

Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell:

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges.
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
 3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above

02/05/23, 13:36 - Makanaka EWYL23E0027: All of the above
02/05/23, 13:48 - Makanaka EWYL23E0027: There are 13 principles 
1.) Desire : For one to be successful , it is crucial that there exist within them the desire to be great or at least better than their current situation. Without desire there is no motivation or cause of action
2.) Faith : With desire one has to believe that it will come true, it will start manifesting in it's physical self. Our beliefs hold so much power that out desires almost always come true
3 ) Auto suggestion: There is a strong reason why we do not believe in our dreams,  we see ourselves as unfit to have them . This belief has been installed in us by the society. In order to get rid of them one has to meditate or start writing things you desire on small placards and read them several times a day
4.) Specialized knowledge:  if acquiring knowledge ensures success professor would be wealthiest af a lot , but having knowledge doesn't make one intelligent or successful. It's not acquiring knowledge but using it is what makes one successful. One has to focus on the knowledge that will make your desires come to reality
5.) Imagination: One has to visualise the picture of the fruits of one's desire as realty
6.)Organised planning: one has to have a concrete plan, take your time and draft it and write it down , the chances of it becoming a reality increases 
7.) Decisions: One has to stick to his decision one made not changing it regularly is not much of a decision. One has to take strong and well thought out decision and then see them though out to the end
8.) Many people fail in the first attempt some in the 100th attempt. The determination that one has ensures that his desire will come true
9.) Power of the master mind: in order to achieve what one desire , one need to align their thoughts vibrations with similar vibration which can be achieved by keeping the company if like-minded people
10.) Transmutation: Hill explains that we have a strong sexual energy within us that we use to charm and attract the people we have interest in. If we gather this energy and use it through creative imagination we will be able to sound and seem more charming to people, this charm we use it to convince people around us though them we can achieve our goals
11.) The subconscious mind: A person can control his subconscious mind, controlling and quieting our conscious mind and instilling the belief we want see reflect  in our lives, it can be achieved through meditation
12.) The brain: When one creativity spikes our subconscious mind reaches a state where it can be programmed comparatively easily which is why we need to be involved in creative task that help us to get into the right state if mind
13.) Sixth sense: This is ones intuition or gut feeling and it becomes more profound when you start mediating and tuning into our subconscious mind. Our subconscious mind is our connection with the infinite wisdom if the universe , we get answers to our questions that would otherwise eluded us . These answers may come to us as a hunch or gut feeling
