27/03/23, 16:44 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”
27/03/23, 21:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

As informed earlier, I was not available last week from Thursday to Friday and the organization was closed on Saturday and Sunday. So let's focus today's session solely on these three things:

1) Wednesday lesson + Weekend activity understanding
2) Whether you were able to complete last week's Projects targets?
3) What are the challenges you are facing in the projects?

Also, this week will be visiting our _Proud Indian Edoofians_ from Wednesday to Saturday. So, the sessions will be held at that time. And I will be very happy to share the updates of our visit with you as the days go by?
27/03/23, 21:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, you have not shared the responses on the questions I asked you last week on school details?
27/03/23, 21:13 - VITTALIS EWYL22E1315: I'm still working on the schools will share tge details asap
27/03/23, 22:43 - Saloni Rastogi: I just want to know whether your school is connected or not, rest we will discuss accordingly Vittalis.
27/03/23, 22:53 - VITTALIS EWYL22E1315: Yes they're
27/03/23, 23:24 - Saloni Rastogi: Proud Edoofian, today, I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.
27/03/23, 23:24 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead tomorrow.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him\/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
27/03/23, 23:38 - VITTALIS EWYL22E1315: Ok noted will do so
27/03/23, 23:38 - VITTALIS EWYL22E1315: I have other contacts
29/03/23, 00:20 - VITTALIS EWYL22E1315: I'm a proud edoofian
29/03/23, 00:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Alright, I have noted your answer, the correct answer will be revealed shortly.","transform":"
29/03/23, 00:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for the delayed response, I was occupied in an internal meeting with the team with was to be attended as a priority about our visit starting tomorrow till Saturday.
As informed, no sessions will be held during this time and we will begin afresh from next week onwards where I will be sharing some crazy and interesting insights with you.
But this will only be done, we you will NOT MISS these *THREE THINGS*:
1) Timely submission of the Wednesday lesson and weekend activity
2) Daily following the ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', the absence of which can lead to not sharing of weekly lessons and activities with you
3) and most importantly, *PROGRESS ON PROJECTS*

I will be tracking the progress on _Monday_.
I completely know that these two weeks, we might not have dedicated discussions on the projects. So in my absence, I want that you think in-depth about *the project you are doing, revising the targets for the same, and completing it*.
I would really be emotional and happy that in a few months, many of the new edoofians will be joining our Indian family here. And honestly, I will be happier that we start preparing now for the future because growth is not measured in one day. We need to work hard consistently and dedicatedly.

Like I always say ‘1 step daily means 1 step UP. 0 step daily means 1 step DOWN’.
I trust you, just believe in yourself.

03/04/23, 21:13 - Saloni Rastogi: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

06/04/23, 02:11 - Saloni Rastogi: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
06/04/23, 02:11 - Saloni Rastogi: It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
06/04/23, 02:12 - Saloni Rastogi: So, This is what the First message should look like:
06/04/23, 02:12 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Mr.\/Mrs *School Head Name*

08/04/23, 20:12 - VITTALIS EWYL22E1315: Ok so the Wednesday lesson was putting great emphasis on consistency and it major role into granting one a successful future and career and it was degenerated into three three major factors which are consistency in learning, practice and in studies.
08/04/23, 22:52 - Saloni Rastogi: I completely agree with you and I am happy to see the consistency in your sharing your response.

Let me summarize the lesson for you.
▪️Consistency is the key to success in any aspect of life, and the same applies to a
student's skill development and career growth. 
▪️Firstly, consistency in studies is crucial for a student's academic success. This not only helps students to cover the syllabus in time but also ensures that they have a clear understanding of the concepts. 
▪️Secondly, consistency in practice is vital for developing skills. 
▪️Lastly, consistency in learning is crucial for career growth. 

Consistent studies, practice, and learning are essential for achieving academic success, developing skills, and staying ahead on the job market

08/04/23, 22:56 - VITTALIS EWYL22E1315: Yes thank you
17/04/23, 12:28 - VITTALIS EWYL22E1315: Good morning hope you had a great weekend..
17/04/23, 12:53 - VITTALIS EWYL22E1315: Ok so after some research l've discovered some problems that are affecting my community and they're as follows:
1.Land pollution:(improper dumping site)
2.Land degradation 
3.Water pollution 

And the above problems have had a massive impact in the community in the sense that due to improper dumping sites it has now created an ugly environment since anyway can be identified as a dumping site moreso has acted as a fuel to a series of outbreak of diseases like the recent one of cholera which is seeing at it's worst taking people's lives and most of the times it will those of the young age,land degradation has seen itself as an ugly contributory factor in the community as there are no roads bt only dust road and due to rain the road will now be left with potholes you cant imagine and still water hanging from all of the major parts of the roads and this hasn't only caused to make the environment and the society ugly bt also mosquitoes now have vast breeding places and outbreak of mosquito related diseases hve now been a nuisance and lastly due to the improper  dumping sites after heavy rains water will flow from the sites into people's well polluting their water source which is commonly used this side which can cause diseases and can be seen as unhygienic tendencies..

And these problems can be mitigated by clearing the community and setting up a proper dumping site provision of education on the need not to dump refuse anywhere,there is also need of construction of tarred or gravel roads in order to minimise the rate of potholes and still water jamming in the road as well as to improve the transport system and lastly provision an installation of proper protected water sources like boreholes to provide safe water source as it can now be used for basic needs like drinking,cooking and even bathing and those from the well will be for extensive use like washing clothes.
17/04/23, 13:03 - VITTALIS EWYL22E1315: And basing with the current state of matters in my hand l think l would hve to kindly ask for a change in projects as the current ones are giving me a hard time as l shared with you the other day that my local school and peers are really ignorant with studying in India or will l say abroad due to lack of finance so they do not bear to have some of the required money which will be needed and to explore outside schools there will be need to communicate in person as l told that at my former school the headmaster got changed so l can't work with him since his not familiar with me and this needs me to go there introduce myself and be  acknowledged  by other teachers who still know me bt for that l'll need transport money which can be a problem to get and also at this side schools are closed we're on holiday so it will be hard to get access of schools as they're closed
17/04/23, 15:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Vittalis!
