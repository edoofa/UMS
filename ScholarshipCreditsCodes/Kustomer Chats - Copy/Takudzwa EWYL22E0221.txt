13/10/22, 01:15 - Aditi Kapoor: What an amazing video Takudzwa!
I am amazed by the clarity and confidence in your speech, brilliant :fireworks:
13/10/22, 01:16 - Aditi Kapoor: We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real-life example. That is how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because in the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.
Responses will be submitted on the EWYL Line only.

Happy Learning.

How are you?
22/10/22, 04:45 - Aditi Kapoor: As I shared yesterday in our session on the EWYL Line, we will be discussing two crucial things:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. what have you learned about the Deepawali festival so far  

I am excited to discuss both things with you!
22/10/22, 15:37 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0221: Greetings Ms Saloni, I'm fine thanks and you?
22/10/22, 15:46 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0221: 1. In my Wednesday wisdom, I learnt about humility as it is from this very popular footballer, Mane. He is the popular person known for being a millionaire with a broken iPhone which taught me not to focus on material things but to focus on the opportunities I have and make the best out of them.
The other thing I learnt is not to forget where I came from and to always appreciate who I am and where I come from as Mane received support from his family after his father's death and now he is a millionaire and still supports his family and community as a whole as it has been mentioned that during COVID 19 he donated for his country, community
22/10/22, 15:56 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0221: 2. So far, I have learnt that deepawali is festival of lights  celebrated here in India, the festival represents the same symbolic victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. There will be plenty of fireworks and lights as well.
22/10/22, 18:23 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Takudzwa!
How are you?
22/10/22, 18:23 - Aditi Kapoor: I feel on the Wednesday lesson that the struggle exists to change us and our lives we struggle because it is the key to the path of our destination of what we want or what we want to become filled with challenges, knowledge, and so on. Without struggle, we humans won't be able to achieve what we have today.
We both have spoken on similar grounds and yes it was indeed a very inspiring tale.
22/10/22, 18:25 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, that's great Takudzwa.
It is a Hindu festival that marks the grand welcome of Lord Rama his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after long battle and hardships.
Moreover, the bigger significance that this festival taught me as a student and I want to teach you as well is that it marks the birth of a better version of ourselves, this day brings motivation to us to fight the evil in us and work for the best. It says aloud that, 'work hard, and struggle to strive for the good'.
Being your mentor, I want you to realize that you are made to do much bigger things in life and aim high. I want that you set aims in your life and work hard to achieve them.
Tell me, will you promise me that?
22/10/22, 18:27 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0221: I'm fine thank you.
22/10/22, 18:32 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0221: That is absolutely nice
22/10/22, 18:33 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0221: Sure ma'am I'll work on that
22/10/22, 18:35 - Aditi Kapoor: I am glad that you liked it.
22/10/22, 18:40 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0221: Okay
22/10/22, 18:41 - Aditi Kapoor: So may I know what is the update on the school heads that you had a word with?

22/10/22, 18:45 - Aditi Kapoor: Did you call them?

26/10/22, 17:19 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Takudzwa!
How are you?
26/10/22, 17:19 - Aditi Kapoor: As a part of your weekend activity, you were supposed to write,
• mail stating your exam schedule and your date for rejoining the EWYL sessions attaching your datesheet\/exam schedule as a part of the mail

or

• mail addressing me about what has been my role in shaping your career so far and what you have learned from me, being specific there.

In our session today on the EWYL Line, we will discuss:
- mail drafted by you
26/10/22, 17:26 - Aditi Kapoor: Also Takudzwa, I saw all the screenshots that you shared with me.
I have a few things on my mind that can be done.
1) you can drop a follow-up text to all the schools today
2) in case you don't get any reply today over WhatsApp, ring them in the evening and direct them towards your inbox stating, 'I am Takudzwa, a proud Edoofian' + tell them about Edoofa + tell them that you have texted them way back and this can be the most awaiting opportunity in their life and for their school
3) in case both of the things don't work, it can be a big possibility that the information of the school is either available on their wen=bsite or on Google, maybe we can fetch information from there.
26/10/22, 17:44 - Aditi Kapoor: website*
27/10/22, 18:43 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0221: I'm fine thank you.
27/10/22, 18:43 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0221: Noted
27/10/22, 18:43 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0221: Okay
27/10/22, 23:01 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the kind of mindset a winner possesses, and about the person who carved his way from the bottom to the top, and even beyond. 

In this session on the *EWYL Line*, we will talk about:
1) your opinions on the Wednesday lesson
2) pending mail as a part of the weekend activity
27/10/22, 23:02 - Aditi Kapoor: May I know if you texted them?
28/10/22, 19:55 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0221: I am a proud Edoofian
28/10/22, 19:56 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
28/10/22, 20:05 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0221: From my Wednesday wisdom, I learn about having a winner's mindset if really I want to win. Staying focused on what I do like Kobe could put himself in a kind of a cage so that he can focus on the game in which his goal was to be a winner.
I also learnt that discipline is a key factor to be a winner like Kobe mentioned that he had to stay disciplined everyday for 20 years.
Another lesson was about the switch. One need to be focused and be consistent to become a winner as Kobe had to switch from being a regular player and become a winner as he had to become constant and focused on his sessions and games to be able to win.
28/10/22, 20:05 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0221: Yes I have text and only one just replied me
He said he's interested.
So how will I connect you with him?
28/10/22, 23:09 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Takudzwa!
How are you?
28/10/22, 23:09 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, I completely understand what you said Takudzwa on the Wednesday lesson and I am happy with the affirmation that you have shared with me.
I want t add what I feel- Punctuality and showing respect in this growing stage of life are the foundation of success. Success is meaningless without them. I am always looking to pass these lessons on to the younger players, they are the secret to excelling and developing their game.
28/10/22, 23:10 - Aditi Kapoor: That is great Takudzwa.
