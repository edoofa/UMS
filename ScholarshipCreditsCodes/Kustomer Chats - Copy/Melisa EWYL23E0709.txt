Have an incredible and productive day ahead!
24/11/23, 20:31 - Melisa EWYL23E0709: On Wednesday I had lesson on "The effective ways of executing project 2, that being Community building. 
I understood that under this project, I have to create a WhatsApp group. After I do so the main goal would be to identify the right students who can be a part of the group. And to be able to do this, I get in touch with my school mates who are currently in form 6, or those who have already passed their form is, that is their A level examinations. I enter their form 6 unofficial WhatsApp groups and then I share with them the link to my WhatsApp group that I would have created. This I do so with an attachment of a catchy phrase, *Those who want to fullfil their dreams of higher education at a very affordable price can join my group*. 
Once students join the group, I start sharing with them the information about the EDOOFA program,  before the counseling session. I will be sharing information about the opportunity to study in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fee. 
I will be repeating the same process with other students in other divisions.
24/11/23, 20:31 - Melisa EWYL23E0709: I also understood that I will earn scholarship credits, following the process where I will earn $20 for every student that enrolls in the Edoofa program and pays the first part of the enrollment fee. 
When the student(s)  complete the Admission formalities of the university, I will be awarded $30 worth of scholarship credits. There is also an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa scholarship.
24/11/23, 20:31 - Melisa EWYL23E0709: I also got to learn about the African Schools Education Reform Mission, which is a project that follows a process where I will be reaching out to local schools in my region. I will be informing headmasters about the EDOOFA programme. 
I can start by listing all the highest secondary schools in my local area. 
I have to connect with the principals on WhatsApp or through calls. During the interaction, I can share with them why I joined EDOOFA and also later tell them about how I have planned my future, and also share the EDOOFA  programme details with them. 
After this, I could ask them if they would like me to set up an online meeting with the EDOOFA programme director, where they can have a conversation. 
After this, I can share the contact details of the principal with the EWYL mentor.
24/11/23, 20:35 - Melisa EWYL23E0709: Thank you
25/11/23, 20:32 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians, hope you are doing well.

As part of your Saturday Activity, I encourage each one of you to dedicate some time to journaling for just one day.

28/11/23, 16:31 - Melisa EWYL23E0709: Sorry for handing in my journal late.
28/11/23, 16:32 - Melisa EWYL23E0709: My Journal 

Growing up, I had a dream of becoming independent, successful and powerful. Those three goals  meant  everything to me and that was all that mattered to me. 

I cherished those goals to the extent that I turned everything around me off and became more to myself than to others. All these years, I clinged onto my goals, became busy and I neglected some factors that I should have validated since day one. I had this mentality that I can have it all and I can manage it all by myself. 
My friendships did not last, because I could not initiate conversations and I was not consistent when it came to following up on the friendships that I had with pupils who were interested in befriending me. Eventually I was left alone, and with time became a lonely person. 

I had decided to focus on my goals, but I was not aware of the fact that, there is more to life than just dedicating and investing all your time, mind, and emotions on your goals; and also that we all need people to help us in our lives, we can not do it all on ourselves. 
To redeem myself, I had to reset my mindset and start looking at the bigger picture. After ages, I realised that I was missing out on great things. No friends, no quality time with your family, no time for embracing humanity. This had changed me into a cold and sad person. 

I made a decision, 'I have to change,' and registering that in mind did wonders to me. I then noticed that life evolves from a certain choice(s) or decision(s)  that one makes on a daily basis. It is good to have set goals, but these goals should leave room for humanity and healthy personal growth, rather than just concentrating on one side, that being building a career only. Our careers shape us and so does the benefits that we acquire from them, but one should not neglect important values that shapes them. 
I remember failing at school, this came to me as a surprise, because I constantly told myself that I had it all. This outcome jumbled me. I thought to myself that indeed one aught not to think and act all high and mighty because we do not know what tomorrow holds. 

One should be human enough to be humble to oneself and to others as well. It is good to take time to reflect on others and the environment you are in, as much as you would reflect on yourself. It is not only you and your affairs that matters, but things like caring for others, giving a hand, being dependable matters as well. We need people in our lives, because without people there is no growth, no challenges, no lessons and experiences of all kind. 

I try my best to focus on myself, but also I notice and validate my environment, in the same vein, doing away with ignorance and negligence.
28/11/23, 16:33 - Melisa EWYL23E0709: Thank you so much

"Your present circumstances don't determine where you can go; they merely determine where you start." - Nido Qubein

This profound quote encourages us to see our current situation as a starting point, not a limitation. It emphasizes the limitless potential for growth, learning, and transformation, regardless of our current circumstances.

01/12/23, 16:38 - Melisa EWYL23E0709: Understanding the task is very important, one needs to carefully analyze the given task. This helps one to identity the key inputs required to fulfill the task. After understanding the task, one needs to consider the inputs, that is analyzing the inputs. This analysis helps to assess what you already have and what needs to be acquired. 
After identifying the inputs, you need to develop a plan, that is a way to work out the task. This involves analyzing different approaches to the task and then coming up with the best method to achieve the desired output. 
Outputs need to be evaluated because this helps in assessing whether or not the output aligns with the task requirements. This helps one to learn and improve. This also helps in identifying strengths and weaknesses, thereby helping in the refining of approaches in the future.
01/12/23, 17:09 - Unknown: *It is time to wrap up our session.*

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

04/12/23, 11:55 - Melisa EWYL23E0709: The Spirit of Competition

The spirit of Competition is a passion that one upholds to win at something or come out on top. 

It is both negatively and positively sided. On the negative side, one can be led to cheating and it sprouts up violence and hostility. On the positive side, it can motivate people to try their best and push themselves to new heights. 

When it comes to th spirit of Competition, the main focus should be mainly about motivation and self-improvement. It is more of an internal competition than it is of an external one. It is not about beating the other person, but instead, it is about being the best version of yourself and doing your best as an individual. With this, it is a competition with yourself, where you you will be challenging yourself to meet new targets and strive to be better than you were yesterday. 

This is a healthy type of competition, because even when you lose at something or fail something, you will still uphold the feeling that you would have done your best and with this you will never give up until you achieve the desired target. 

I remember when i was in the lower course of my A level course, i was motivated by students who were always on top in class. I had a very deep desire to be llike them, as i was average in my grades. The competition that i embraced was not that one in which i strived to beat them, but rather, it was about me striving to out do myself and be the best version of myself with all that i had in me. I remember failing my exams in the third term of this course, i was hurt, i had not done enough but, and felt disappointed, but what i told myself was that i can do it no matter what. I would always remind myself that i can, must and have to be better. 
This helped me a great deal, i felt motivated and encouraged and up until now, i still strive to improve myself in everything area of my life.

13/12/23, 14:46 - Unknown: *Happy Wednesday*🌻

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

15/12/23, 16:06 - Melisa EWYL23E0709: With honesty, one can acknowledge his or her strengths and weaknesses. And can be able to set realistic goals.
Honesty is a tool for self awareness.
Honesty fosters an environment of open communication. It brings forth transparency and also personal growth.
Staying true to oneself and the task at hand brings forth great rewards for a lifetime.
15/12/23, 16:15 - Melisa EWYL23E0709: Hardwork is backed up by determination, resilience, dedication, efficient management of time and then consistence when it comes to putting in the required effort to succeed.
Hardwork involves going an extra mile as far as acquiring extra knowledge and skills in the academic sector. This act also goes beyond academic issues.
It lays a strong and secure foundation for a fulfilling and impactful life.
