12/07/22, 17:56 - Musuthu EWYL22E0086: Good morning Ms Riva
12/07/22, 19:11 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian,
I noticed that you were absent from our scheduled sessions.
Due to this, You missed out on the things that were too covered in the sessions.
To cover up on what we missed, *We will be connecting regularly at the same time today onwards*.
Please make sure that you inform me prior if something like this happens.
12/07/22, 19:11 - Unknown: Also, since we had your session yesterday we will be contining with the same discussion.
12/07/22, 19:12 - Unknown: Also, my previous text remains unanswered.
Ms.Davi informed me that your name is in the defaulter list.
I talked to her and told her that first I will communicate with you.
12/07/22, 19:34 - Musuthu EWYL22E0086: Oky thank you
12/07/22, 19:34 - Musuthu EWYL22E0086: Oky we can continue
12/07/22, 21:01 - Unknown: Can you please notify me the reason why you have been absent ?
13/07/22, 03:17 - Musuthu EWYL22E0086: This term students are not allowed to go to school with cell phones.
13/07/22, 16:32 - Musuthu EWYL22E0086: Good morning Ms Riva, im a proud Edoofian
13/07/22, 16:34 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

19/07/22, 16:20 - Musuthu EWYL22E0086: *A detailed submission on the fast growing industry\/sector\/business in our  country.*

Most of the African countries have over the years seem to be lagging behind in industrial activities as compared to some western countries. Many countries are still developing especially in Africa and Zimbamwe happens to be one of the countries.

Very few business sectors have been fast growing in Zimbabwe where as the majority of the business sectors are not growing as per expected due to many reasons. 

The farming sector has been one of the fast growing business in Zimbabwe. Having good climactic conditions which include favourable temperature and annual rainfall, have triggered the farming sector. 


Most areas in the country have rich soils which favours various crop production.  The main crops which are grown include maize, tobacco and yarms.  None food crops like trees  on tree plantation farms are also grown in the eastern part of the country.  The timber manufacturing sectors have over the years raised the economy of the country. 


Farming in Zimbabwe also include cattle ranching. Many farms are keeping beef and milk cattle.  Despite the changes in climactic conditions in the country, the farming sector has been operating normally through the use of modern ways of farming, that is the use of fertilisers, irrigation schemes as well as chemicals to control pests and animal diseases. 

The farming sector is also a primary industry which provides the raw materials to the secondary industries where the Agricultural products are added value so that they are sold at a higher price and giving much profits. 


The exportation of the agricultural products have raised the country's name and create relationship with many countries. This also brings foreign currency in Zimbabwe and raise the Gross Domestic Product of the country hence economic growth.

From the previous lesson  I learned about time management. Being able to plan for each and every tasks that is expected to be done in a specified duration of time. The lesson explain urgent task and important task. Urgent tasks are those which require our immediate attention whereas important tasks are those which matters and we are ought to do they since not doing them may result in problems on us or others. The lesson also teaches about the quadrant which divides tasks in categories, do first , do next , do later and don't do. On my point of view, important tasks are to be done first . In a nut shell; the document illustrated much about time management issues as of paramount important.
