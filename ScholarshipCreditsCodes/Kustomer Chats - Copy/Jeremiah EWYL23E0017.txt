27/03/23, 18:52 - Jeremiah EWYL23E0017: Greetings Ms Saloni I am Jeremiah Chilenga and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Jeremiah EWYL23E0017
27/03/23, 20:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Jeremiah!
How are you?
27/03/23, 20:47 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
27/03/23, 20:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
27/03/23, 20:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
27/03/23, 20:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
27/03/23, 22:24 - Jeremiah EWYL23E0017: Yes
27/03/23, 22:26 - Jeremiah EWYL23E0017: Yes
27/03/23, 23:38 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know on which project will you be working in the coming weeks?
28/03/23, 00:50 - Jeremiah EWYL23E0017: I'm not yet sure
28/03/23, 00:51 - Jeremiah EWYL23E0017: What projects can I work on?
28/03/23, 21:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

As informed earlier, I was not available last week from Thursday to Friday and the organization was closed on Saturday and Sunday. So let's focus today's session solely on this thing:

Projects to be done for the coming week

Also, this week will be visiting our _Proud Indian Edoofians_ from Wednesday to Saturday. So, the sessions will be held at that time. And I will be very happy to share the updates of our visit with you as the days go by?
28/03/23, 21:10 - Saloni Rastogi: We discussed three projects right, let me share the document with you again.
28/03/23, 21:12 - Jeremiah EWYL23E0017: I'm a proud Edoofian
28/03/23, 21:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Alright, I have noted your answer, the correct answer will be revealed shortly.","transform":"
28/03/23, 21:32 - Jeremiah EWYL23E0017: Okay
28/03/23, 21:32 - Saloni Rastogi: The correct answer is A. Zambezi

Do you know? 

The Zambezi River is the fourth-longest river in Africa, the longest east-flowing river in Africa and the largest flowing into the Indian Ocean from Africa.","transform":"
28/03/23, 21:33 - Jeremiah EWYL23E0017: That's amazing to know
29/03/23, 00:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for the delayed response, I was occupied in an internal meeting with the team with was to be attended as a priority about our visit starting tomorrow till Saturday.
As informed, no sessions will be held during this time and we will begin afresh from next week onwards where I will be sharing some crazy and interesting insights with you.
But this will only be done, we you will NOT MISS these *THREE THINGS*:
1) Timely submission of the Wednesday lesson and weekend activity
2) Daily following the ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', the absence of which can lead to not sharing of weekly lessons and activities with you
3) and most importantly, *PROGRESS ON PROJECTS*

I will be tracking the progress on _Monday_.
I completely know that these two weeks, we might not have dedicated discussions on the projects. So in my absence, I want that you think in-depth about *the project you are doing, revising the targets for the same, and completing it*.
I would really be emotional and happy that in a few months, many of the new edoofians will be joining our Indian family here. And honestly, I will be happier that we start preparing now for the future because growth is not measured in one day. We need to work hard consistently and dedicatedly.

Like I always say ‘1 step daily means 1 step UP. 0 step daily means 1 step DOWN’.
I trust you, just believe in yourself.
08/04/23, 18:40 - Jeremiah EWYL23E0017: Are we having a session today
08/04/23, 23:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Jeremiah!

Our weekly Wednesday wisdom focussed on Napolean Hill's 13 Principles of Success and it deeply talked about 6 such principles that can make you think out of the box.

2) Project Update

24/04/23, 14:05 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian, ready for a motivational monday?

In a remote village, there lives a hardworking farmer who owns a farm. Over the years his grapery yields rich crops, and the farmer is very successful. He has three sons, who are young and energetic but never worry about working. As the farmer grows older, he begins to worry about his sons’ future.

Then he becomes very ill and feels that his death is coming soon. He calls his sons and says,

“Dear sons, I see my death approaching, but I want to share a secret before you all leave. These areas have treasure hidden inside. Dig the whole area after my death, to find it. ”

The old farmer died. The sons start digging for money without leaving any part of the field but nothing is found. In any case, digging their fields leads to healthier crops and results in higher incomes. These earnings make the sons realize what their father means.

What according to you is the moral of the story?

a. Hard work always pays off. The fruits of hard work are always sweet.
b. Be Selflessly kind
c. both a & b
24/04/23, 14:08 - Jeremiah EWYL23E0017: a.
