Personally, This is one of my favourites books that I have ever read.

The book encourages readers to view themselves as entrepreneurs of their own lives, constantly evolving and seeking new ways to thrive. It highlights the significance of building and nurturing a strong network, embracing change, and continuously learning.

Don‚Äôt you think that this is what we aim at doing through the EWYL Projects?

Well, you know Our weekend was quite remarkable, as we hosted some exceptional students from PDM University who visited our office.

We organized an outing to Cyber Hub in Gurgaon, where they were able to experience various popular establishments such as McDonald's, Domino's, Decathlon, Marc and Spencer's, and Archies. They also had a chance to see the offices of some of the big companies like Toshiba, Kia etc.

It was a pleasure getting to know them outside of the sessions and having the opportunity to connect with them on a more personal level.

Furthermore, the students had the opportunity to spend time with our team at our office, participating in enjoyable activities.

Given the excitement of the experience, I feel compelled to share a glimpse of the event with you.
Therefore, I am sharing some videos below, I would be very glad to know your views on it. Soon, I will be sharing a detailed video on this with you.
09/05/23, 15:36 - Saloni Rastogi: Edoofians at our Office

09/05/23, 15:45 - Saloni Rastogi: Since, I was away this weekend, therefore, You were not able to receive the Saturday Activity and the newsletter. In order to make sure that you do not miss out on anything, I am sharing them below..


You can go through the Activity after our Today‚Äôs session and submit your response by the Day end.
09/05/23, 15:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Dear Proud Edoofian,
As we go through life, we all make decisions - some good, and some bad. But what separates good decisions from bad decisions, and how can we learn from our experiences to make better choices in the future?

For your Saturday assignment, I would like you to write about your understanding of good decisions and bad decisions. What factors do you consider when making a decision, and how do you know when you have made a good or bad choice? In addition, I would like you to share an example from your life where you made a good or bad decision. What was the situation, what decision did you make, and what was the outcome? What did you learn from this experience, and how has it shaped your decision-making process in the future?

Your submission should be around 200 words in total, and I encourage you to reflect deeply on your experiences and thoughts on decision-making. Remember that we can all learn from our mistakes and successes, and by sharing our experiences, we can help each other make better choices in the future.
09/05/23, 15:46 - Saloni Rastogi: NEWSLETTER

Please make sure that you reach out to me on time in the *EWYL GROUP*
09/05/23, 16:29 - Tariro EWYL23E0089: Okay
09/05/23, 23:19 - Tariro EWYL23E0089: According to my own personal point of view, good decisions are choices that one makes after thinking carefully, weighing on positive and negative outcomes of the choice being made. Bad choices on the other hand are the exact opposite of good decisions. They are decisions made impulsively without thinking.
The following are factors that l consider before making a  decision
1.How will it benefit me
2.Is the decision worth taking?
3.At the end of the day, will the decision that l make affect me alone or it will affect the next person too?
09/05/23, 23:23 - Tariro EWYL23E0089: I would know l have made a bad decision if:a) the choice l made affects the next person
b) l end up getting hurt
c) the decision l made has not benefitted me in any way
09/05/23, 23:28 - Tariro EWYL23E0089: After I wrote my A level, l got tired of sitting at home all day. So, l asked my mother to give me money so that I could start doing a project. I suggested broiler keeping and she bought the idea. She bought everything needed for the project to run, twenty five chickens, broiler starter, growers and finisher
09/05/23, 23:37 - Tariro EWYL23E0089: I kept my chickens and they grew, l later on sold them but l was very reckless with the money. I spent it on buying food and taking my friends out. At the end of the day l had spent all the profits that had made as well as the money that l used for my startup
09/05/23, 23:40 - Tariro EWYL23E0089: I failing to even buy myself clothes because l wanted to potray a luxurious lifestyle that l didn't have
09/05/23, 23:42 - Tariro EWYL23E0089: From this
I told myself that I needed to rectify my mistakes
Firstly by working hard so l can earn money to redo my broiler keeping project and l did just that
09/05/23, 23:44 - Tariro EWYL23E0089: I learnt  that l need to be proud of who l am and not try to make friends through money.
09/05/23, 23:46 - Tariro EWYL23E0089: I also learnt that, every project that I do or work that I do should be aimed at bettering my family and I. My family and l should enjoy the benefits of my work outcomes
10/05/23, 00:00 - Tariro EWYL23E0089: Then this one is an insightful writing from Mr Angad ‚ú®. It  is about the importance of heroes and their relevance from back in the day upto this 21st century. He connotes that one ought to self introspect and know their hero.
10/05/23, 00:00 - Tariro EWYL23E0089: And what makes them say that they are their hero
10/05/23, 00:04 - Tariro EWYL23E0089: He also states that it is important for one to persue a career that they are passionate about and give it their all. There is also need to accept individuality and one's true self
10/05/23, 15:16 - Saloni Rastogi: I would like to take a moment to express my appreciation for the thoughtful and insightful understandings you shared on good decisions and bad decisions. Your analysis of the factors that influence decision-making and the outcomes that determine whether a choice is good or bad was particularly insightful.
10/05/23, 15:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Dear Proud Edoofian,

I am excited to announce that today‚Äôs Wednesday Wisdom will be talking about the spirit of belonging and the feeling of being part of the Edoofa student community. As a member of the Edoofa family, it is important to understand the significance of being part of a community that fosters personal and academic growth. We will explore the benefits of being part of the Edoofa student community, including the sense of belonging and unity that it creates, the opportunities for networking and mentorship, and the development of essential skills such as leadership, teamwork, and communication.
The Lesson also delve into the idea of belonging as an ability, and how we can develop this ability to connect with others, build relationships, and establish a sense of belonging that allows us to feel valued, appreciated, and accepted.

Let's come together to learn, grow, and build a stronger sense of community.
Best regards,
Team EWYL
