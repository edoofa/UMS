I hope you all had a wonderful holiday break. Before we dive into today's lesson, I'd love to hear about how your Christmas was. Did you do anything special or have any interesting experiences you'd like to share?

Don't have  any complaints 



I didn't do anything special 
Celebrated Christmas with my family 😊😄🧚🏼‍♀️💫
26/12/23, 15:47 - Ananya: Why don't you share some pictures from yesterday? I also want to see how you celebrate Christmas over there!

26/12/23, 16:48 - Shalom EWYL23E0717: Christmas is a very important holiday in Zimbabwe, and many families have their own special traditions. For example, many families will attend church services on Christmas Eve, and then return home to enjoy a festive meal. The main course is usually a roasted chicken or goat, and it's usually accompanied by sadza (a thick porridge made from cornmeal) and vegetables. Families often exchange gifts, and children may receive toys and other special treats. Many families also like to decorate their homes with colorful lights and festive decorations. Are you curious about Christmas in other parts of the world, too? 😊Christmas is a very important holiday in Zimbabwe, and many families have their own special traditions. For example, many families will attend church services on Christmas Eve, and then return home to enjoy a festive meal. The main course is usually a roasted chicken or goat, and it's usually accompanied by sadza (a thick porridge made from cornmeal) and vegetables. Families often exchange gifts, and children may receive toys and other special treats. Many families also like to decorate their homes with colorful lights and festive decorations. 

Zimbabwe has a lot of unique customs and traditions when it comes to celebrating Christmas. In addition to the things I mentioned, many families will make a special effort to visit and spend time with their extended family during the holidays. It's common for families to gather at the home of an elder relative, like a grandmother or grandfather. Families often sing Christmas carols together, and they may also share memories and stories from the past 

In  Zimbabwe, many families celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve, rather than Christmas Day? They believe that it's more important to spend time with loved ones on Christmas Eve, rather than wait until the next day. On Christmas Day, families may go to church or visit friends and family. Another fun fact is that Santa Claus isn't a big part of Christmas in Zimbabwe. Instead, families focus on celebrating the birth of Jesus, and children may receive gifts from their parents or extended family. That's a pretty big difference from the way Christmas is celebrated in some other parts of the country
26/12/23, 16:50 - Shalom EWYL23E0717: One of the most unique traditions of celebrating Christmas in Zimbabwe is the concept of "kuganha." This is a tradition where family and friends gather together to share food, drink, and conversation. The idea is to create a sense of community and connection, and to build relationships with the people in your life. Kuganha often takes place in the evening on Christmas Eve, and it usually lasts for several hours. There's usually a lot of laughter and storytelling involved!
26/12/23, 17:00 - Ananya: Lovely, Shalom! For today, we need to wrap up our session, and we will continue this discussion in our next session, which is on Friday. Meanwhile, do not forget to follow your EWYL ritual, as I will be sharing your lesson with you.
26/12/23, 17:02 - Shalom EWYL23E0717: OK noted
27/12/23, 16:53 - Ananya: _Happy Wednesday my proud edoofian_,
I hope this message finds you well.

Today's Wednesday lesson is particularly significant as we delve into the theme of ushering in the new year with purpose and determination🤝. As we step into the new year, let's commit to establishing objectives and cultivating a mindset that thrives on effort, resilience, and continuous learning. The path to success is an ongoing journey, and by adopting a growth mindset, we can unlock our full potential.

Let's make the coming year a testament to the vast possibilities that lie ahead when we combine goal-setting with a mindset that values effort and adaptability⛳. I look forward to an engaging and insightful discussion during our upcoming session.

Best Regards
Team EWYL

It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, you must maintain regular communication with the students and address any queries they may have.
02/01/24, 16:25 - Shalom EWYL23E0717: Okay will do so
02/01/24, 16:26 - Shalom EWYL23E0717: I had some students who wanted to apply but had some queries in regards to the process 

The EWYL  program process

That is it a must to do it ? 

As in what if you don't wnt to undergo the process due to the projects
02/01/24, 16:34 - Ananya: Well, no, it's not a must to do EWYL; however, it is recommended to be a part of it as it makes you employable-ready along with earning credits.

05/01/24, 13:57 - Shalom EWYL23E0717: Goodmorning 

I'm so sorry I won't be able to join the session today 

Will be occupied with some personal stuff
05/01/24, 16:35 - Ananya: Please accept my apologies for not being able to connect with you today. I was engaged in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

Considering that more than half of our scheduled time has already passed, I believe it would be wise to reschedule our session for the next available slot. In the meantime, I'd like to share that around this time last year, I implemented a monthly target system for my students based on their fees. They set financial goals for each month to cover their tuition expenses, and it proved to be highly beneficial. Many of them arrived in India with one semester's worth of fees saved, thanks to a year of planning. Recently, they successfully redeemed their credits to pay their tuition fees, fulfilling my wish for their financial success.

I am considering implementing a similar approach for you. Today, I encourage you to invest your free time in planning out this month by setting a target for yourself. Your monthly goal should be a minimum of $100. I wish you the best of luck, and I look forward to receiving your prepared plan by our next session. Good luck!
06/01/24, 13:08 - Ananya: Greetings on this beautiful day✨

I don't quite understand 


Should I share my experiences of the workshop or seminar l attended of the Edoofa Scholarship Program or any school workshop or seminar
06/01/24, 15:30 - Ananya: Any workshop, Shalom!
06/01/24, 15:41 - Shalom EWYL23E0717: Ok once attended a school seminar for Family And Religious studies and English at Maranatha high


And the seminar was productive and fruitful for me 

As I got a lot  of ideas on how to write essays 
How to answer and analyze questions 
How to read and understand a question 
How to manage the time given to answer questions and still answer all the question 
How to choose questions to answer 
How to handle my nerves when in an examination
06/01/24, 17:29 - Shalom EWYL23E0717: Hello

Goodafternoon
07/01/24, 13:19 - Ananya: Good morning!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
07/01/24, 13:19 - Ananya: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
12/01/24, 09:47 - Shalom EWYL23E0717: Goodmorning 

Sorry couldn't join session yesterday was at school and phones are not allowed at school
12/01/24, 15:38 - Ananya: Good afternoon, Shalom!

Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
13/01/24, 12:29 - Shalom EWYL23E0717: Goodmorning ,I'm sorry that 
 couldn't join session as I was at school and phones are not allowed at school 

Please do share a few glimpse  of the industrial visit, SLICE 24
