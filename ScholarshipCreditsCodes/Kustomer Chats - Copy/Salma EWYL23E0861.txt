Get ready to unleash your potential because you're not just here to keep up; you're here to outshine. The competition? It's the spice that makes success sweeter. In this journey of learning, every test, and every assignment is a chance to outdo yourself. Imagine a world where you consistently surprise even your own expectations. It's not about beating others; it's about becoming a better version of yourself. So, let's tackle challenges with passion, bounce back from setbacks with resilience, and commit to being better than we were yesterday. The world is waiting for the unique brilliance that only you can bring. You've got this!

Your mentor

Hope you're doing well!
This week's Saturday activity was an absolute game-changer, and I can't wait to dive into the details with you today. The challenge pushed me to think outside the box, and I'm excited to share my insights.

After that, let's switch gears and delve into the thrilling progress we've made on our projects. It's going to be an engaging session, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts and contributions on the EWYL Line.
27/11/23, 16:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Salma, I'm curious to understand why you haven't participated in the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' for the past three days and also why you were not present for today's session on time. If there's any particular reason or concern, please feel free to share. Your consistent engagement is valued, and we want to ensure everything is well.
27/11/23, 16:23 - Salma EWYL23E0861: I'm doing good and you?
27/11/23, 16:24 - Salma EWYL23E0861: For the past few days there was no electricity so my phone had no power. When you say *daily ritual* do l send that message written that only?
27/11/23, 16:27 - Saloni Rastogi: *Daily Morning Ritual:* Each day, we'll kick things off by saying, "I am a proud Edoofian" on the EWYL Line. 🌄 Let's remember that being an Edoofian means being a strong advocate for positive change, focused on self-improvement, and dedicated to making our families proud.

27/11/23, 16:33 - Saloni Rastogi: Salma, now I am sharing the Saturday activity with you You can work on it after the session ends and share your response with me. For now, we can continue our discussion on projects.
27/11/23, 16:33 - Saloni Rastogi: As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals?

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL

27/11/23, 16:42 - Salma EWYL23E0861: So do I explain what spirit of competition in my words or ?
27/11/23, 16:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, explain in words after our session.

Also, can you share about the projects?
27/11/23, 16:52 - Salma EWYL23E0861: Okay ... I am still looking for the people who are willing to take this opportunity
27/11/23, 16:58 - Saloni Rastogi: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/11/23, 16:59 - Saloni Rastogi: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*

For eg: In your case, it will be-

*Salma/Saloni/27NOV2023*
27/11/23, 16:59 - Saloni Rastogi: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
27/11/23, 16:59 - Saloni Rastogi: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
27/11/23, 16:59 - Saloni Rastogi: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
27/11/23, 16:59 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
27/11/23, 17:02 - Salma EWYL23E0861: Okay noted
27/11/23, 20:24 - Saloni Rastogi: In this edition, discover the wonderful ways our proud Edoofians in India are embracing Indian culture. 🕊️
