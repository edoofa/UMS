16/01/24, 13:14 - Betty EWYL23E1054: 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <Betty Tatenda Chikwavarara> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....Betty EEYL23E1054'
16/01/24, 13:19 - Ananya: Good morning, Betty!
I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:
Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! ðŸ˜„
16/01/24, 13:28 - Betty EWYL23E1054: ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
16/01/24, 13:29 - Ananya: For today, I have planned something special! Do you know about a resume or a CV?
16/01/24, 13:35 - Betty EWYL23E1054: Yes
16/01/24, 13:37 - Ananya: You know, a resume is like a super important paper for students. It shows all the cool things you've done in school and outside. When you want to get into a good school or get a job, you give them your resume so they can see how awesome you are. It's like your personal advertisement that says, 'Hey, I'm really good at these things, and I can do great stuff for you!' So, having a good resume helps you stand out and get cool opportunities.
16/01/24, 13:46 - Betty EWYL23E1054: Ok
16/01/24, 13:50 - Ananya: Well, yesterday I was updating my little brother's resume and took help from this video. I thought to share this with you as well, as he is suggesting some really good things!

16/01/24, 13:59 - Betty EWYL23E1054: Ok thank you
16/01/24, 14:04 - Ananya: By the way, have I shared the pictures with you from the SLICE-CON?
16/01/24, 14:30 - Ananya: I was expecting a response from your end, however, now that our session time is over, remember, every effort you put in is a step closer to success. Keep participating, stay motivated, and earn those credits! You're all doing great, and I look forward to our continued journey together. See you next time!
16/01/24, 14:36 - Betty EWYL23E1054: No
16/01/24, 14:36 - Betty EWYL23E1054: Sure
19/01/24, 13:45 - Betty EWYL23E1054: 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <Betty Tatenda Chikwavarara> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....Betty EEYL23E1054'
19/01/24, 13:52 - Ananya: Betty, you do not have to share the same message every time. You have to follow your EWYL ritual on a daily basis so that you can receive your lessons and activities and, therefore, never miss out on any important updates.
19/01/24, 13:52 - Betty EWYL23E1054: Ok
19/01/24, 13:52 - Betty EWYL23E1054: I didn't know
19/01/24, 13:53 - Betty EWYL23E1054: Oooh, I thought its Tuesday and Friday only
19/01/24, 13:54 - Ananya: That's alright! By the way, I was hoping to move forward with our session that day, where did you disappear?
19/01/24, 14:02 - Betty EWYL23E1054: I was available, Its just that with power outrages, network is always tripping
19/01/24, 14:09 - Ananya: All right, Betty, many of my students have already earned $100-$200, and I want to share their secret with you! You know, I set weekly and monthly goals for them. This has proven to be the best way to earn credits in a strategic manner. I was thinking of starting this with you as well. Are you in?
19/01/24, 14:11 - Betty EWYL23E1054: Yes
19/01/24, 14:19 - Ananya: Alright, so connecting with 5 students and submitting their application forms with me is your weekend target! Remember, our goal is to earn $100 in the next month. To achieve that, we will set a weekend target, giving you enough time to work and connect with your students! I have a vision for both of us â€“ we will earn enough credits so that you won't need to spend a single penny for your second-semester fee, and we will achieve it.
19/01/24, 14:31 - Betty EWYL23E1054: Sure
19/01/24, 14:31 - Ananya: Alright, that's great! Let's connect on Tuesday, and best of luck with your target!
19/01/24, 14:31 - Betty EWYL23E1054: Ok
19/01/24, 14:33 - Ananya: Now that our session time is over, let's connect on Monday since we don't have sessions over the weekend. Happy Weekend! ðŸš€
19/01/24, 14:35 - Betty EWYL23E1054: But you said Tuesday
19/01/24, 15:41 - Ananya: Kindly excuse eme for the confusion, we shall connect on Tuesday!
19/01/24, 15:54 - Betty EWYL23E1054: Ok thanks for clearing it up
