Will Artificial Intelligence revolutionize our world or render us obsolete?

 As we witness the remarkable progress in AI, we ponder its potential to transform our lives and simultaneously question if it will replace us
18/11/23, 16:16 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!

21/11/23, 13:05 - Ananya: Good morning, Tawanda!
How are you doing today?  Let us dive into our session with an amazing fact! Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. üçØ
21/11/23, 13:10 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: Wow what an amazing fact it is, I had no knowledge of it until now,thank you very much.
21/11/23, 13:13 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
21/11/23, 13:43 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: It is duly noted. Thank you
21/11/23, 13:44 - Ananya: Well, I believe that we should begin with something that aligns with your interests. So, would you like to share which one is your favorite project: community building or school reform?
21/11/23, 13:46 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: My favorite is community building.
21/11/23, 13:51 - Ananya: Great! Could you share your progress in the project?
21/11/23, 14:32 - Ananya: Tawanda, I was expecting a response from your end during our session. However, since our session time is over let us connect in our next session. I hope to have a fruitful session next time.

24/11/23, 13:02 - Ananya: Good morning, Tawanda!
I hope you're doing well. Let's kick off our session with an exciting activity! I'd love to hear about your favorite animal, and in return, I'll share an amazing fact about it. Are you ready?
24/11/23, 13:09 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: My favourite animal is a dog, I like it because it is loyal and it's cute.thank you.
24/11/23, 13:11 - Ananya: Great ! Did you know that the Basenji dog breed is known as the "barkless dog" because it doesn't bark like other dogs? Instead, it makes a unique yodel-like sound known as a "barroo," due to the shape of its larynx. It's a fascinating trait that sets the Basenji apart from other breeds!
24/11/23, 13:17 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: Wow this is a great and amazing fact, I think I would look for one Basenji dog in the future, thank very much.
24/11/23, 13:18 - Ananya: Why, Tawanda? Don't you like barking dogs? üòÄ
24/11/23, 13:33 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: I do like them ,but it just seemed like an interesting breed,I like trying out new things.
24/11/23, 13:41 - Ananya: Haha, alright! Now, you know, 2023 is wrapping up. Don't you think we should kick off the new year with something big? How about committing to earning a specific amount of scholarship credits?

After all, you wouldn't want to head to India empty-handed.
I'm saying this from my own experience ‚Äì having some credits before you arrive in India isn't just a benefit for you; it's a help for your parents too. Not only this, we often pick students for internships and personal training based on their credits and regularity in the EWYL journey.

Believe me, you've got plenty of time right now being in your home country, so don;t you think we should utilise this time with our utmost dedication?
24/11/23, 13:46 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: Yes ,I think we should do so. Thank you.
24/11/23, 13:55 - Ananya: Kindly excuse me the constant delay in our conversation today, I am facing some technical difficulties.
24/11/23, 14:00 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: It is okay. Thank you
24/11/23, 14:00 - Ananya: Great news, Tawanda! I've finalized a few students for a 30-day challenge, and I want you to be a part of it. I need you to attend the sessions dedicatedly and put in the hard work for your EWYL projects.

Moreover, I'll set specific targets for you, and I want your commitment to work diligently to achieve them. As your mentor, I'll be there to guide and support you every step of the way. Is that alright with you?
24/11/23, 14:49 - Ananya: Now, I wish you a good luck for your task. Let us connect in our next session so that we can discuss about your progress.
24/11/23, 15:35 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: Yes it is alright. Thank you.
24/11/23, 15:36 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: OK have a nice weekend. Thank you

Let's kick off our session with a fascinating scientific fact:

The Eiffel Tower can actually be 15 cm taller during the summer. This happens because the iron expands in the heat and contracts in the winter, causing the height variation.ü§Øüóº
28/11/23, 13:25 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: Wow this is mind blowing.ü§Ø
28/11/23, 13:28 - Ananya: Tawanda, I advise that you follow your EWYL ritual early in the morning. As you know, the Saturday activity is generally shared in the afternoon. Since you did it late at night (IST) this time, you missed it.
28/11/23, 14:06 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: OK I understand, thank you very much
28/11/23, 14:11 - Ananya: Tawanda, may I ask about your inconsistency during the session? I hope you understand that our session is scheduled for just 1.5 hours, and if you er going to reply after 40 minutes, how would be able to have a fruitful discussion?
28/11/23, 14:15 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: I am sorry about that ,I was facing internet connection difficulties. I apologize .
28/11/23, 14:59 - Ananya: Alright, I hope to have a fruitful session which is on Thursday at 9:30 a.m. Meanwhile, I wish you all the best for your target!

02/01/24, 13:06 - Ananya: Good morning, Tawanda!

Before we dive into today's session, I'm curious ‚Äì how was your New Year? Did you have a chance to celebrate and welcome the new chapter?
02/01/24, 13:11 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: Good morning,  my new year was eventful,  I hd a chance to welcome a new  chapter. Thank you very much
02/01/24, 13:18 - Ananya: Great! Well, I want to gently remind you about the importance of submitting your Saturday activity. It appears that you have not received it as you did not follow your ritual. 
I understand that life can get busy, and sometimes deadlines slip our minds. However, let's view this as a fresh start and an opportunity for growth. Instead of scolding, I encourage you to reflect on this as a chance to improve your time management and organizational skills.
Mistakes happen, and what's essential is how we learn and grow from them. If there are any challenges or concerns you're facing, please feel free to discuss them with me. Together, we can work towards a successful and productive year.
02/01/24, 13:36 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: Ok, it is duly noted. I have faced some challenges last year due to a number of factors,  like network challenges with the phone which I was temporarily using but I got my old phone repaired , I have reflected  on my poor decision making choices and I turned over a new leaf . Thank you very much.
02/01/24, 13:38 - Ananya: Alright, so Tawanda can I know if you are working on your EWYL projects?
02/01/24, 14:02 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: Yes I am working on them.
02/01/24, 14:12 - Ananya: So, can I know on which project you are exactly working on?
02/01/24, 14:14 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: I have been working on the community building project.
02/01/24, 14:21 - Ananya: Alright, so would you like to share your progress with me?
02/01/24, 14:26 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: I have managed to reach out to 10 students,  2 of them wrote their Adviced level final exams in 2022, and the rest are waiting for their final examination results which will be coning out this year.
02/01/24, 14:28 - Ananya: Alright, so did anyone submit their official application form with you?
02/01/24, 14:31 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: Yes 2 of them managed to submit their forms.
02/01/24, 14:33 - Ananya: Have you shared those forms with me?
02/01/24, 14:42 - Ananya: Tawanda, I was expecting a response from your end; however, since our session time is over, I am concluding our session. Let us connect in our next session now which is on Friday!
02/01/24, 14:42 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: Yes in the EWYL group
05/01/24, 13:00 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: I am a proud edoofian
05/01/24, 13:00 - Ananya: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

Yeukai Chatema, a proud edoofian, graciously shares her profound gratitude for the invaluable role Edoofa has played in her academic journey.

The commitment to excellence exhibited by both Yeukai and Edoofa symbolizes the ethos of continuous improvement and dedication to empowering the next generation of leaders.
05/01/24, 13:13 - Ananya: Good morning, Tawanda!

Every day is a new beginning, take a deep breath and start afresh. On this note, let us begin our session and make a change together! ‚òÄÔ∏èüåº
05/01/24, 13:16 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: Good morning, he are you doing this morning?
05/01/24, 13:17 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: How
05/01/24, 13:20 - Ananya: Thank you for asking, Tawanda! I am doing good.
05/01/24, 13:25 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: That's great
05/01/24, 13:33 - Ananya: Great! So for today, we will be discussing our third project which is the school reform mission. I will share a few tips and tricks for it! Are you ready?
05/01/24, 13:34 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: Yes I am ready. Thank you very much.
05/01/24, 13:35 - Ananya: Alright, So, there are two ways to work on the African School Reform project:


A. *Connecting with school virtually*-
‚ñ™Ô∏è In this you would have to find the contacts of the schools through your peers, friends, neighbors, cousins, school teachers, and school heads.
‚ñ™Ô∏èThen introduce yourself to them professionally and state the purpose of connecting with them along with their available time.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share information about Edoofa that I will be providing you in order to help them understand the Program deeply and with more clarity.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share the school form with them, and if they are interested in connecting with us, then our aim should be to get the form filled.
05/01/24, 14:00 - Tawanda EWYL23E0777: Ok I am following.
05/01/24, 14:01 - Ananya: B. *Visiting schools physically*

‚ñ™Ô∏è Now by this, as it clearly says, you have to visit schools nearby and inform them about Edoofa.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Visiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏è With this, you will surely gain a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, overcome the fear of presenting yourself and your family Edoofa, spontaneously in front of anyone at any point.
