25/07/22, 03:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

09/08/22, 19:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Tinashe!
How's your day going?
09/08/22, 19:59 - Saloni Rastogi: For better communication and elaborative discussion, I want to give you my undivided attention during our session.

10/08/22, 20:59 - Saloni Rastogi: It is so good to connect with you over the EWYL line. It is a place where I connect with most of my students trying my best to know their goals, and ideas and give them their free space to bring their imagination and discuss with me.
Being your mentor, my aim is to add 21st Century skills to your knowledge and make you explore things out of the box and yes, help you in doing your projects with you so that you are able to earn maximum scholarship credits.
So tell me, what are your expectations from me and from your EWYL program?
10/08/22, 21:59 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609: I expect to be mentored welly with love and passion so that I can be a great future leader.
11/08/22, 00:43 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Tinashe!
Due to some medical emergency, I would not be able to take your session today.
But, nothing to worry about, I will do better after some time.
And by the time we have our next scheduled session, I want you to keep following the proud edoofian ritual.
Till then, have a great day.​
​And yes, we have our cultural festival tomorrow, named Raksha Bandhan. I want you to search for it, and if it gains your interest, we will surely discuss it in our next session.
11/08/22, 03:06 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609: Thank you ma'am, l hope you are oky
11/08/22, 22:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

15/08/22, 21:32 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

23/08/22, 04:25 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609: It was a nice and innovative lesson offered by the Edofian Scholarship program founder Agand Singh whereby we were being shaped our career so that we may become sharp as the sharp edged sword in terms of academics and this can help change the world by being knowledgeable students. One of the quotes mentioned l loved most was the one mentioning the two educations that we have, the one that teaches us how to live and the other how to make a living. I was eye opened to discover that, one with an educative mind tend to find it easier to live due to skills earned which can make one have a better insight and ability to create strategies in making a living. We are learning to change both ourselves and the outer most world on large,  for a better leaving standards  of everyone we need a person who stands supportive and firm and for one to be like that, he or she needs abilities through education. It was really a nice lesson and I'm enjoying the EWYL lessons and that makes me  a proud edofian. Thank you
01/10/22, 17:53 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609: Good Morning , l am a proud edofian

06/10/22, 20:23 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing well, thanks for asking.
06/10/22, 20:24 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know why did you not submit your past responses?
06/10/22, 20:41 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609: I liked this one  , because it was teaching on being patient in taking actual paths and avoid short paths because it may lead to delays that will cost too much that taking the long path
06/10/22, 20:43 - Saloni Rastogi: That's amazing Tinashe, I am happy that it drove your interest.
06/10/22, 20:43 - Saloni Rastogi: And I expect such similar interaction from you in the future as well with me.
Will you do that?

How are you?
09/10/22, 15:54 - Saloni Rastogi: Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. Those unfamiliar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.
Responses will be accepted on the *EWYL Line* only.
_Till then keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'_.

Happy learning and enjoy your weekend!
09/10/22, 17:45 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609: Okay will do so ma'am thank you
10/10/22, 04:43 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609: Thank you ma'am
10/10/22, 21:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Tinashe!
How are you?
10/10/22, 21:19 - Saloni Rastogi: It is important Tinashe that you realize that I have all my time reserved for my students. I feel happy to motivate my students to learn new skills each week and share with me how those lessons have impacted and brought a change in them. And you know what, the way you want to earn scholarship credits and help yourself financially, I am working 10 times more than everyone so that all my students avail the best out of this opportunity. But I feel more saddened for the fact that each time I have to make you realize to follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', this is something which should be done by you without any reminders.
10/10/22, 21:20 - Saloni Rastogi: Most of my time goes on reminding you to follow the daily ritual and keep on pushing you to share your understanding with me on the lessons and activities. Do you think that in this way we will be able to fulfill the main purpose of being connected with Edoofa?
Today, I want you to tell me whether you are actually interested in working as hard as I do for your growth and development or not?
If it is a yes, then of course I want equivalent activeness and consistency from your side as well.
And if not, then I would want you to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi that you don't want to continue with your EWYL Program despite consistent efforts from your mentor.

Please decide and let me know.
10/10/22, 21:21 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609: Morning Ma'am
10/10/22, 21:21 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609: I'm willing to continue on with my session and I'm sorry
10/10/22, 22:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Tinashe, if next time I have to remind you to share your response with me or to follow the daily ritual then I would feel really bad that despite my constant efforts and reminders you are not dedicatedly working hard.
11/10/22, 01:44 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609: I will try my best starting today ma'am
12/10/22, 18:09 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609: Good morning ma'am I am a proud edofian
12/10/22, 18:09 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609: Sometimes not getting  in reach with you is because of data problems and sometimes l will be in an exam
13/10/22, 12:08 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609: Morning ma'am , I am a proud edofian

How are you?
14/10/22, 23:25 - Saloni Rastogi: I would like to correct you here.
It is 'edoofian' not 'edofian'.
Please see to it.
14/10/22, 23:26 - Saloni Rastogi: In case you have your exams then I can give you an option to put your EWYL Program on hold for some time.
What do you think about it?
14/10/22, 23:28 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609: I'm good and you ma'am
15/10/22, 03:27 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609: Thank you

16/10/22, 23:44 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

How's your day going?
21/07/22, 22:37 - Unknown: I have not received your response yet to the weekend activity Tinashe, may I know why?
In case you are facing any challenges, please let me know, I am there to help you out.
21/07/22, 22:37 - Unknown: Along with this, let's move on with our session.
Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our WEDNESDAY Wisdom was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
3. your pending response to the weekend activity
22/07/22, 05:57 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609: You didn't send my weekend task to me yet ma'am
22/07/22, 05:59 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609: I have learnt that blaiming the world won't make a change but making a change for yourself will change the world .In times of failure , we should focus on ammending our does to settle our own achievements
22/07/22, 17:34 - Unknown: Good morning Tinashe!
How did your day go?
22/07/22, 17:35 - Unknown: I read your response Tinashe and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.

25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
