25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:07 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

19/08/22, 19:54 - Unknown: Proud Edoofian, I must say that these past 2-3 weeks has taught me different aspects of life.
19/08/22, 19:55 - Unknown: It started with the arrival of around 100 energetic Edoofians who came from different parts of Africa. I loved how each student brought along a different story and a different experience. 

After spending almost 3 long weeks, Meeting our Edoofians, I must say that I have made lots of friends and in someway I am also motivated to see the potential these students have brought along.
19/08/22, 19:55 - Unknown: I now feel that it is my responsible to harness this potential in the right direction.
It is now my mission to make sure that our students are able to self fund their studies here and become employement ready✨.
