23/08/22, 00:36 - Gerald EWYL22E0508: Good evening, my name is Talent and my mentor is Mr. Anshul.
23/08/22, 00:47 - Unknown: There are obviously two educations. One should teach us how to make a living and the other how to live.  Truslow Adams

How are you my proud edoofian?
23/08/22, 03:19 - Gerald EWYL22E0508: I am fine sir and how are you?
23/08/22, 18:09 - Unknown: I am well Talent.
23/08/22, 18:51 - Unknown: Talent i wanted to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times pere week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"
23/08/22, 18:51 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian” 

This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
25/08/22, 00:14 - Unknown: Hello talent, how are you doing?
26/08/22, 00:11 - Gerald EWYL22E0508: Good evening sir, I am a proud Edoofian.
Below is my response to the Wednesday Wisdom lesson.
26/08/22, 00:11 - Gerald EWYL22E0508: I believe what drove these three particular individuals to success was tenacity in the face of hardship. They chose not to let their past and current circumstances hinder them and instead strived and yearned for a better tomorrow. These characteristics including a hard-work oriented mentality and a goal-getting mindset eventually allowed them to see their dreams come into fruition. This is something that should be instilled in today's youth so that they come to realise that the right attitude, mindset and mentality can go a long way in correlating to future success.
26/08/22, 00:13 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
26/08/22, 00:43 - Unknown: If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more, you are a leader.  Quincy Adams

Greeting of the day! Please share the \"I am a proud edoofian\" chant for the day Edoofian.
26/08/22, 00:44 - Unknown: As I shared with you yesterday, this week's Wednesday Wisdom focused on three business success stories that went from rags to riches and became epitome of motivation.
26/08/22, 00:44 - Unknown: Learning to be a good leader is something I have constantly promoted with you since I know you have it in you to lead others to success after becoming a capable individual yourself.
26/08/22, 00:47 - Gerald EWYL22E0508: Thank you for the wonderful words of wisdom, sir.
26/08/22, 00:47 - Gerald EWYL22E0508: I am a proud Edoofian.

26/08/22, 00:54 - Unknown: My aim with the projects is to teach you the basics of the needed skills so that you have the required knowledge and exposure and Ms. Davi helps us achieve this with the Wednesday lessons and Activity. This is why the working on them is crucial and even more important to practice these 21st century skills in real life with the help of your EWYL projects.
26/08/22, 02:21 - Gerald EWYL22E0508: I understand, sir. Thank you for the information.
