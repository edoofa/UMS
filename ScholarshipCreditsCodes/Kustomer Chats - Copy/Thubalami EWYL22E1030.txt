27/06/23, 11:06 - Thubalami EWYL22E1030: Two traits of Ellen Johnson which resonate with me are, perseverance and adaptability. Perseverance gives a person the ability to stand against anything with a smile on their face. It has been one of my strengths since Alevel. When having career goals and long term plans, the one with perseverance is able to continue focusing on the goal, even if things tend to go south. However Adaptibility is also a key trait as it allows one to be able to also adjust themselves to match the traits required for the goal set. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is a very perfect role model, when it comes to personal development as from her life, we are able to also learn to develop resilience and Visionary leadership.

 *Action plan* :

28/06/23, 21:41 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

29/06/23, 13:41 - Thubalami EWYL22E1030: Good morning ma'am, thank you for the Wednesday wisdom, am truly learning a lot
29/06/23, 14:03 - Thubalami EWYL22E1030: Our Wednesday lesson was about a student named Alex, who lived in Successvile. Alex had a  burning desire to achieve great things like most of us although he was only an average student. After he encountered a book about "the power of identity based habits" in the park his life changed. From reading the book, he got something that l also hadn't learnt before. He found the key to his long desired goal, that is to align one's habits with their desired identity. From the story l find that, it's not just  only about achieving goals  but also about the person you would have become in the process. If you achieve your heartily desired goal but you find out that at that time, you did not grow to become the best version of yourself, you won't get that full satisfaction that you've done it. I also learn that, if l want to achieve great goals, l have to find ways to enjoy the process that leads me to getting there. As l begin enjoying the process, and having the vision of becoming the best version of myself , l begin to attract  others who have the same goals and l am also able to influence others to work on unleashing their true potential also. It's not about what l will accomplish but it's also about who l would have become in the process.

 *Application of the Wednesday lesson*
~ developing a habit of enjoying every process that leads to my goal
~point 1 leads to me, gaining resilience and endurance against any circumstance
~developing habits that can make me the best version of myself, for example, beign a good listener.
