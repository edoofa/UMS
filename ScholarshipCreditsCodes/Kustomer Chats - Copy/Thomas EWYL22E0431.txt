13/12/22, 22:07 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings of the day!
How are you?
13/12/22, 22:08 - Jasmine Kaur: May I please know your EWYL Group name and mentor name?
13/12/22, 23:58 - Thomas EWYL22E0431: My EWYL name is Thomas Kazonda and my mentor's name is Ms.Riva
14/12/22, 19:12 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings my proud edoofian,
How are you doing today?

I hope you know that you will be getting your *Wednesday lesson* today, BE READY!
Also, I would like to take an update on your progress in the projects!

As you have seen that I am putting consistent efforts so that you guys can learn and earn, I would like you to tell me about the efforts you have made so far for us to be successful as a team!
14/12/22, 19:15 - Thomas EWYL22E0431: Yes indeed you are putting a lot of effort for my success.Thank you very much.
14/12/22, 19:17 - Jasmine Kaur: Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say
14/12/22, 19:24 - Thomas EWYL22E0431: I'm proud to be a part of the Edoofa community.
I will text you first thing in the morning .
14/12/22, 20:28 - Jasmine Kaur: Today I wanted to discuss the recent message I shared with you. The message that we want to be our daily habit, our words of connecting and experiencing a sense of belonging, We all at team Edoofa are very thrilled as we personally are undertaking the same activity. May I know what have you understood from this message, what is the intention behind the same?
15/12/22, 01:02 - Thomas EWYL22E0431: Every morning I should text “I am a proud Edoofian ” this is acknowledging that I am part of a community whose sole purpose is everyone's success.Being an Edoofian means that I am a strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader of tomorrow.
15/12/22, 01:03 - Jasmine Kaur: - That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!

- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.

- How do you intend to broaden this student community? In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.","transform":"

I hope you are having a good day!


Here is the quote for today:

 I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. –Michael Jordan
22/12/22, 16:44 - Thomas EWYL22E0431: I am a proud Edoofian
22/12/22, 16:46 - Jasmine Kaur: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals towards achieving this goal. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

I would appreciate you sharing your learnings from today’s lesson. 

Happy learning!

17/01/23, 20:05 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my lovely edoofians, hope you are doing well.

I have some amazing news and an opportunity to share with you. But first, do you know, A 2018 report by WaterAid India and Menstrual Hygiene Alliance India (MHAI) states that there are 336 million menstruating women in India, out of which only 121 million use sanitary pads. Assuming that these women use eight sanitary pads for one cycle (conservatively), a simple calculation reveals that almost one billion sanitary pads are used and disposed of every year.  The primary component in all disposable sanitary napkins is plastic. This takes approximately 500-800 years to fully disintegrate after disposal. Assuming one billion DSNs are disposed of every year, handling menstrual waste becomes a mammoth task.

And the solution to this problem is Sustainable menstruation!

Wondering what it is :

* Sustainable menstruation refers to the use of alternative products during one’s menstrual cycle for the benefit of the body and the earth.
* Sustainable menstruation is being mindful of the negative effects disposable sanitary products have on our environment in an effort to reduce the plastic waste ending up in our oceans or landfills.

I would like to invite you to our webinar on Sustainable menstruation tomorrow I.e. 18th January 2023, wherein we will be joined by Dr.Aarushi Kehar Malhotra. She will be helping us understand it better and how can each one of us be the solution to this problem.

Don’t forget to join by 5:45 PM IST, the webinar will start exactly at 6:00 PM [2:30 PM: Zimbabwean time] . Don’t be late for this webinar. Come prepared with the questions that you might have!

02/02/23, 00:29 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

Happy Learning!

This is good.

How is your morning, how is the weather there?
03/02/23, 21:27 - Thomas EWYL22E0431: Im fine thank you.
03/02/23, 21:28 - Thomas EWYL22E0431: the weather is perfect thank you for asking
03/02/23, 22:26 - Jasmine Kaur: There is something that I would like to discuss with you today, it is regarding the responses you have been receiving from our end whenever you greet me by saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian”. Did you notice that these are the same text every day?
03/02/23, 22:31 - Thomas EWYL22E0431: Yes I have noticed
03/02/23, 22:41 - Jasmine Kaur: I would like to inform you that these are automated messages that you receive. Automated text messaging is one of the easiest ways to stay connected with our large student community and acts as an affirmation of our identity as proud Edoofian. Isn’t it?
03/02/23, 22:42 - Thomas EWYL22E0431: Yes
03/02/23, 22:44 - Jasmine Kaur: You would also agree that time is important to everyone, and we realised that close to 70% of discussions had fallouts due to slow responses. Since I have more than 100 students who I am mentoring at the moment, I like to be personally invested in each one’s growth. I was facing a challenge in addressing each and everyone timely. But I wanted to make sure at least each one receive a reiteration of our proud identity from my end as well. Therefore, It was strategically decided to use technology to help us in maintaining our sense of community, keeping our spirits high, and also ensuring I have a maximum time in my day to focus on your skill development and sessions. So we thought of using technology for assistance and hence the idea of using automated responses.
03/02/23, 23:20 - Thomas EWYL22E0431: yes I understand
04/02/23, 00:30 - Jasmine Kaur: May I know how you felt the moment you received a message from my end, which was a sincere response to your greetings?

Ready??                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
