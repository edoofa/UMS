I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.
Our sessions are on Tuesday and Friday from 12:00 PM to 1:30 PM.

To help you make the most of all the projects available, I have devised a target table that has proven to be successful for many of my students. By following this target, you can contribute your time in a smart way and earn many credits along the way.
30/05/23, 17:53 - Prince EWYL22E1219: Following

30/05/23, 18:18 - Ananya: Today we're going to talk about how to find student-centric SMEs in Africa using Google and LinkedIn. Are you familiar with these tools?
30/05/23, 18:19 - Prince EWYL22E1219: Yes
30/05/23, 18:20 - Ananya: That is great,Let's start with Google. When you're searching for student-centric SMEs in Africa, what keywords do you think you should use?
30/05/23, 18:24 - Prince EWYL22E1219: Recently funded start ups in Zimbabwe/ Ghana etc
30/05/23, 18:28 - Ananya: I can see that you have a golden personality, and interestingly, when I took the personality test, it also revealed that I have a golden personality.
30/05/23, 18:30 - Prince EWYL22E1219: Really ?
That's amazing and thank you 😊
30/05/23, 18:31 - Ananya: Yes, That's a good start. You could also try "student-centered SMEs in Africa" or "African startups focused on education". Once you have a list of relevant startups, the next step is to find the company officials on LinkedIn. Have you used LinkedIn before?
30/05/23, 18:32 - Prince EWYL22E1219: No
30/05/23, 18:34 - Ananya: That's okay. LinkedIn is a professional networking platform where you can connect with people in your industry. First, you'll need to create a profile if you haven't already. Then, you can search for the company you're interested in by typing the name of the company into the search bar.
30/05/23, 18:35 - Prince EWYL22E1219: Oky , I have to download the application first, right?
30/05/23, 18:39 - Ananya: Yes, now before finalizing the company kindly read the guide for searching the companies document and consider the following points:
30/05/23, 18:39 - Ananya: 1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.​
30/05/23, 18:40 - Prince EWYL22E1219: Oky noted .
30/05/23, 18:46 - Ananya: Now I want you to search for at least five companies, and share a list with  me in your next session.
30/05/23, 18:48 - Prince EWYL22E1219: Oky noted 
Will I be searching only , nothing more ?
30/05/23, 18:51 - Ananya: First search the companies, after that i will guide you to fill the form.

06/06/23, 18:15 - Prince EWYL22E1219: I am a problem trying access people's profiles
06/06/23, 18:24 - Ananya: It typically means that the profile owner has restricted their visibility settings. In order to rectify this and expand your network on LinkedIn, you can follow these suggestions:
Personalize connection requests: When sending connection requests, include a personalized message explaining why you want to connect. This can increase the likelihood of your request being accepted.
Engage with shared connections: If you have shared connections with the desired profile, consider reaching out to those connections and asking for an introduction. Mutual connections can provide valuable introductions and help you expand your network.
Join relevant LinkedIn groups: Joining and actively participating in industry-specific or professional groups can help you connect with like-minded professionals and potentially expand your network.
Attend networking events: Look for virtual or in-person networking events related to your industry or interests. Engaging in conversations and making connections during such events can help grow your network.
Utilize advanced search filters: Use LinkedIn's advanced search feature to narrow down your search and find individuals who align with your professional interests. This can help you find and connect with people outside your immediate network.
06/06/23, 18:29 - Prince EWYL22E1219: Oky noted .
06/06/23, 18:30 - Ananya: So, primarily you have to expand your network!

06/06/23, 18:33 - Prince EWYL22E1219: Most of the companies I found are e- learning companies , they do satisfy all the conditions we discussed right ?
06/06/23, 18:36 - Ananya: Yes, they do.
06/06/23, 18:42 - Prince EWYL22E1219: Oky that's great . And if it is a Gaming , Skincare , Haircare company etc , it has to be student centric .
06/06/23, 18:44 - Ananya: No, it is not compulsory to have a student-centric company!
06/06/23, 18:47 - Prince EWYL22E1219: Alright I understand , now it very clear .
06/06/23, 18:48 - Prince EWYL22E1219: I thought all the companies has to be student- centric

09/06/23, 18:29 - Prince EWYL22E1219: I learnt that, since we are in a changing world , one must continuesly learn and read to strengthen and acquire new skills inorder to complete with the changing world .
We must also treat our career as in work in progress inorder to improve ourselves other than waiting for perfection. 
We must build a strong Alliance with our colleagues , mentors and advisors for personal growth  and also we must learn to adapt in case of unexpected opportunities and also unexpected changes that may not be according to our plan .
