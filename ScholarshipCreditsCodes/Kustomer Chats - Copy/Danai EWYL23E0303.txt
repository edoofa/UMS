21/07/23, 13:40 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
21/07/23, 13:40 - Danai EWYL23E0303: Greeting,I'm fine
21/07/23, 13:41 - Ananya: So Danai, would you like to tell me about your favorite project?
21/07/23, 13:46 - Danai EWYL23E0303: My favourite project is the African schools Education Reform Mission where I would go to different schools and talk with the headmasters about Edoofa sholarships program how I get enrolled and the visions that Edoofa has for it's students and convince them to have an online meeting with the Edoofa program director
21/07/23, 13:49 - Ananya: Really? That's absolutely fantastic! I'm thrilled to hear that! Since I want you to dive into your work with enthusiasm and excitement, let's start by focusing on your favorite project first. How does this sound?
21/07/23, 13:50 - Danai EWYL23E0303: It sounds great
21/07/23, 13:53 - Ananya: Wonderful! May I ask if you were able to find contacts for any school head?

21/07/23, 13:55 - Ananya: That would be awesome! Also, may I ask if you have some schools nearby?

21/07/23, 14:06 - Ananya: That's amazing! So let me share something with you!
21/07/23, 14:06 - Ananya: This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success
‚ñ™Ô∏èVisiting schools physically can put a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, leadership quality, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear to present himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.
