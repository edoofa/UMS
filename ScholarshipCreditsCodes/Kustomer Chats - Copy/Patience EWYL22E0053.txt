19/05/23, 15:55 - Patience EWYL22E0053: I got to understand   the kind  leadership style that is serving leadership  whereby we serve   the people and the characteristics of a servant leader  and that servant leaders  use persuasion  than authority   to encourage people to take action
19/05/23, 17:11 - Ananya: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the Wednesday lesson. It is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.

20/05/23, 16:13 - Ananya: Let's start with Google. When you're searching for student-centric SMEs in Africa, what keywords do you think you should use?
20/05/23, 16:34 - Patience EWYL22E0053: Search for ed tech platforms  ,  sudent  focused organisations
20/05/23, 16:41 - Ananya: Yes, That's a good start. You could also try "student-centered SMEs in Africa" or "African startups focused on education". However while searching do not forget to consider the following points:
20/05/23, 16:41 - Ananya: Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies.
The company can be African or Indian. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
The target audience of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
The company should not belong to these particular sectors:
Manufacturing
Finance
Real Estate/Construction
Energy Solutions
Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.​

23/05/23, 19:37 - Patience EWYL22E0053: Prentice defined leadership as “the accomplishment of a goal through the direction of human assistants” and a successful leader as one who can understand people’s motivations and enlist employee participation in a way that marries individual needs and interests to the group’s purpose. Leadership being natural attribute it remains one of the most critical ability to be prepared for one`s career pathway .
Once identified , it is like a plant which needs to be constantly watched over and natured with utmost care and attention because it serves a  profound role in the success of individual in the job and career market .
Edoofa has however made it possible for students like us through the EWYL program to mould and nature leaders  from early ages .The EWYL are not only significant in self financing but there are more to them such as time management , networking , communication and engagement to prepare leaders of tomorrow .
And all these are critical attributes to make up a good leader 
The community building project as it allows to meet and engage with people from different places , understanding, opinions and all and this goes a long way in helping me to engage with for example clients , investors etc 
The project also helps in networking , advanced networking and communication which are necessities for successful leaders
