12/01/24, 12:55 - Kudzai EWYL23E1041: 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am Kudzai Samantha Ndongwe and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Kudzai EWYL23E1041. I am a proudly Edoofian
16/01/24, 13:16 - Kudzai EWYL23E1041: Morning my mentor, I am a proudly Edoofian
16/01/24, 13:19 - Ananya: Good morning, Kudzai!
I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:
Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! ðŸ˜„
16/01/24, 13:23 - Kudzai EWYL23E1041: ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…Thus awesome
16/01/24, 13:28 - Ananya: For today, I have planned something special! Do you know about a resume or a CV?
16/01/24, 13:29 - Kudzai EWYL23E1041: I know a CV
16/01/24, 13:34 - Ananya: Great! You know, a resume is like a super important paper for students. It shows all the cool things you've done in school and outside. When you want to get into a good school or get a job, you give them your resume so they can see how awesome you are. It's like your personal advertisement that says, 'Hey, I'm really good at these things, and I can do great stuff for you!' So, having a good resume helps you stand out and get cool opportunities.
16/01/24, 13:36 - Kudzai EWYL23E1041: Oky understood
16/01/24, 13:37 - Kudzai EWYL23E1041: Wow it seems interesting
16/01/24, 13:37 - Ananya: Well, yesterday I was updating my little brother's resume and took help from this video. I thought to share this with you as well, as he is suggesting some really good things!

16/01/24, 13:48 - Kudzai EWYL23E1041: Oky
16/01/24, 13:50 - Ananya: By the way, have I shared the pictures with you from the SLICE-CON?
16/01/24, 13:56 - Kudzai EWYL23E1041: No u didn't
16/01/24, 13:56 - Kudzai EWYL23E1041: No you didn't
16/01/24, 13:58 - Ananya: I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.
Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

16/01/24, 14:03 - Kudzai EWYL23E1041: This is awesome
16/01/24, 14:05 - Ananya: Now moving ahead I want to discuss something significant with you. You know, seeing over 400 students in this event has motivated me to work for my students even harder. I want you to be here in India and pay your fee all by yourself. For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed with a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?
16/01/24, 14:10 - Kudzai EWYL23E1041: Okay ,,,,,oooh yes I did
