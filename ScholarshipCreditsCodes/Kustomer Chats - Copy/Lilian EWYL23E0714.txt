[12/26, 2:00 PM] Jasmine@mentor: That is great to know. You know this year, I spent a quiet and reflective time with my family, cherishing the festive spirit. We gathered for a festive meal, exchanged heartfelt gifts, and shared stories.

[12/26, 2:01 PM] 🦋Social✨ Butterfly 🦋: That was interesting indeed

[12/26, 2:52 PM] 🦋Social✨ Butterfly 🦋: Noted
[12/26, 2:58 PM] Jasmine@mentor: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
[12/26, 3:00 PM] 🦋Social✨ Butterfly 🦋: Noted thank you mentor
[12/26, 3:01 PM] Jasmine@mentor: Now you can text on the Line and I will get back to you there in a while.

Whether your goals are related to academics, personal development, extracurricular activities, or any other aspect of your life, we want to hear about them! This is a wonderful opportunity for us to inspire and support one another as a community.

Please take a moment to jot down your goals and be prepared to share them during our Saturday activity. It could be something as simple as improving your study habits, achieving a certain grade, learning a new skill, or even fostering better connections with your peers.✨

_Welcome to the first activity of the year!_
As part of today's Saturday activity, we invite you to share your personal experiences from any event you have attended, whether it be a seminar, workshop, or any other gathering. Our Wednesday lesson already highlighted the skills and experiences we can gain by our active participation in events that are aimed at sharing the Industry experience with young students.

Please take a moment to reflect on the event you attended, and share the key learnings, observations, and any memorable moments. Feel free to include pictures that capture the essence of the event.

For those who haven't had the chance to attend any events yet, don't worry! We encourage you to share your expectations from such gatherings. What do you hope to gain? What are your goals and aspirations when attending future events? This is a chance for you to articulate your thoughts and set intentions for your learning journey.

Remember, everyone's perspective is valuable, and by sharing our experiences, we create a supportive community that thrives on collaboration and shared knowledge. Let's make this Saturday activity a meaningful and insightful exchange of experiences and expectations. Thank you for your active participation!

Best regards,

Team EWYL
