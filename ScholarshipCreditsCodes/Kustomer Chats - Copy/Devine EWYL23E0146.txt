19/09/23, 13:23 - Devine EWYL23E0146: That's an amazing job from Edoofa
19/09/23, 13:23 - Ananya: Indeed. Now I believe we should start something that aligns with your interest. So may I ask which one is your favorite project? Community building or the School reform project?
19/09/23, 13:24 - Devine EWYL23E0146: I prefer community building
19/09/23, 13:25 - Ananya: Wow, that's amazing! So may I ask what are your plans for working in the second project?
19/09/23, 13:27 - Devine EWYL23E0146: I would love to upgrade my community
19/09/23, 13:28 - Ananya: Yes, how would you do it? Do you have any plans?
19/09/23, 13:32 - Devine EWYL23E0146: Right now l want everyone in my community to have access to education, so am encouraging them to do projects such as rabbit keeping and poultry production to pay for their school fees. I am also educating them to abstain from drug and substance abuse.
19/09/23, 13:36 - Ananya: Great! So do you have a group for this?
19/09/23, 13:50 - Devine EWYL23E0146: Not yet l came from a poor community and very few have cellphones and few of them have smartphones but we have a Facebook page called For Our Children (FOC) which is being run by an NGO called For Our Children
19/09/23, 13:54 - Ananya: I understand, however what you can do is :

Go to Facebook and search for "Student Communities in Zimbabwe/ Ghana"
Join a relevant group from the appeared results.
Share information about Edoofa and include the WhatsApp group link.
Interested individuals can join the group and connect with you.
Communicate with them and provide further details about Edoofa.
19/09/23, 14:20 - Devine EWYL23E0146: Okay
19/09/23, 14:21 - Ananya: So for community building:
1) Keep the group updated DAILY.
2) Try reaching out to students from different schools
3) Try reaching out to teachers from your school or others and ask them to share the link to your WhatsApp group with other school teachers from different schools
4) In the group just:
-please give 'only admins' access
-just ask the students/participants to DM you to know about Edoofa and to get the form
-once they DM you, share about Edoofa with them
-Before sharing the form, ask them to get you added to their school groups
-once they do that, then only share the form with them.‚Äã
19/09/23, 14:30 - Devine EWYL23E0146: Okay
19/09/23, 14:30 - Ananya: Great! Now, in order to ensure a minimum amount of credits in your account I will be giving you some targets every week. May I ask if you re up for it?
19/09/23, 14:34 - Devine EWYL23E0146: Yes let's do it
19/09/23, 14:35 - Ananya: Great! So this week you have to submit 2 community building forms with me. Is that alright?
