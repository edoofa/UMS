02/08/23, 18:41 - Munyaradzi EWYL23E0172: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <shumbaMunyaradzi> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'EWYL23E0172
02/08/23, 18:43 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.

There was a boy namely  Wesley  . He grew up in high density  area know as ghetto  or lower class areas .He was not  intelligent and clever enough in doing his things. Meaning he was a slow learner  .He went to school  everyday ,attending all lessons  but at the end of term he failed  .Sometimes  he even cried and other laughed  at him but he keeps persisting  in doing his school  work .At his final year at school he read his  books hardly to the extent  that he knows everything  . He don't share knowledge  to other because  of racism among  learner . The exams days were nearer and he wrote the exams  . Unexpectedly  he passed with flying colors.
