14/10/22, 23:50 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Am A Proud Edoofian
01/11/22, 18:38 - Unknown: Greetings, Proud Edoofian
I hope that you are doing well

Here is a motivational quote for you:
“A little progress each day adds up to big results.”
– Satya Nani
01/11/22, 18:38 - Lacious EWYL21E0558: Yes noted sir
01/11/22, 18:38 - Unknown: \"A goal is not always meant to be reached; it often serves simply as something to aim at.\" –Bruce Lee

The above quote more or less means True success is all about working towards meaningful goals and dreams.

And this was somewhat the idea we learned and discussed in our Wednesday Lesson as well, the mindset of a winner and the habits that lead to it.

In this week's activity, you shall be putting this to use in your own working zone, by creating a list of targets\/goals, that you shall aim to achieve in a week. For a suggestion, you can start by setting up a number of Schools you would try connecting to in a week, the number of companies you shall reach out to, or the number of fellow community mates you would tell about edoofa.

This list, you shall share this with your mentors, and they would also keep a note of it. At the end of the week, you shall discuss with them, whether or not were you able to achieve the target, and what kind of mindset change did this activity lead you to.

Please make the submission using this form:
Project Chosen:
Target:

I hope you all will try to push your limits and aim at the sky always. This activity should be a part of habit building, which would make you a better and more organized individual and professional.

25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:06 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off
