I am happy to see the updates that you have shared with me. This week and our upcoming weeks are all about achieving our targets for the projects. Some students achieved it, and some are still working. I want that you take a moment to realize that only if you *work on the project--->*then only you will earn credits--->then only you will be able to financially assist yourself and your family while paying your college fees*.
We have to think big, and work really hard.

Let's connect in your scheduled session next, till then:
1) Follow the daily ritual
2) Share your pending lessons+weekend activity understanding

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

It's a single, actionable metric that aligns all efforts towards achieving long-term growth. Let us learn about in greater detail, read the lesson carefully and we will connect in our upcoming scheduled session.
