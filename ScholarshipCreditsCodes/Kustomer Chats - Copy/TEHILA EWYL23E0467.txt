EWYL23E0467
07/12/23, 15:49 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: I'm an Edoofian
07/12/23, 15:49 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
07/12/23, 15:53 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Thank you .
07/12/23, 15:55 - Ananya: Well, I believe we should begin with something that aligns with your interests. So, may I know which one is your favorite project: the community-building project or the school connect project?
07/12/23, 15:57 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: The school connect project .
07/12/23, 15:59 - Ananya: That's great! So, may I ask about your progress in the project so far?
07/12/23, 16:01 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: I'm till trying to connect more people around me with the program
07/12/23, 16:10 - Ananya: Alright, may I ask if you were able to find the contact number if your school head?
07/12/23, 16:11 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Yes I was able to
07/12/23, 16:12 - Ananya: Now that you have the School Headâ€™s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
07/12/23, 16:12 - Ananya: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
07/12/23, 16:13 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Ok and I promise will understand
07/12/23, 16:14 - Ananya: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Before diving into today's session, I want to share a few highlights with you from the recent webinar that took place for our students here in India!ðŸŒŸ

https://www.instagram.com/p/C0jSIPrvg_1/
11/12/23, 15:48 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Oh okay
11/12/23, 15:56 - Ananya: Tehila, may I ask why didn't you follow your EWYL ritual on saturday?
11/12/23, 15:58 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Yes I did but no one has said anything back to me
11/12/23, 15:58 - Ananya: Where, Tehila? As I can see you have not shared any message on Saturday!
11/12/23, 16:00 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: I was supposed to send it to you
11/12/23, 16:04 - Ananya: You have to follow your EWYL ritual here on your EWYL line.
11/12/23, 16:05 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Like that ?
11/12/23, 16:08 - Ananya: "I am a proud Edoofian"
11/12/23, 16:09 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: My bad sorry I didn't do that
11/12/23, 16:10 - Ananya: That's alright, Tehila! Make sure to do it from next time.
11/12/23, 16:10 - Ananya: You know, 2023 is wrapping up. Don't you think we should kick off the new year with something big? How about committing to earning a specific amount of scholarship credits?
After all, you wouldn't want to head to India empty-handed.

I'm saying this from my own experience â€“ having some credits before you arrive in India isn't just a benefit for you; it's a help for your parents too. Not only this, we often pick students for internships and personal training based on their credits and regularity in the EWYL journey.
Believe me, you've got plenty of time right now being in your home country, so don;t you think we should utilize this time with our utmost dedication?
11/12/23, 16:10 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Yes I promise
11/12/23, 16:11 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Yes we should .
11/12/23, 16:12 - Ananya: I've finalized a few students for a 30-day challenge, and I want you to be a part of it. I need you to attend the sessions dedicatedly and put in the hard work for your EWYL projects.
Moreover, I'll set specific targets for you, and I want your commitment to work diligently to achieve them. As your mentor, I'll be there to guide and support you every step of the way. Is that alright with you?
11/12/23, 16:14 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Yes it is thank you .
11/12/23, 16:15 - Ananya: Amazing! Let's set a new target for you. For the first 10 days out of the 30, I want you to focus on connecting with two schools and getting eight students to submit their offline application forms.
If you encounter any challenges during this time, reach out to me immediately because we need to achieve this target. I expect you to give it your best effort.
11/12/23, 16:16 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Okay I will give in my level best
11/12/23, 16:20 - Ananya: Now, I want to understand how you will try to achieve these targets. Do you have something in your mind?
11/12/23, 16:22 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Well there is a local secondary school few meters away from my house so I will try going to meet the head teacher tomorrow
11/12/23, 16:23 - Ananya: That's great, is that a high school?
11/12/23, 16:23 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Yes it is
11/12/23, 16:24 - Ananya: Can I know the name of the school?
11/12/23, 16:25 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Itawa secondary school
11/12/23, 16:27 - Ananya: Well, that's great! Since this school is not connected with us, you can connect with them tomorrow!
11/12/23, 16:28 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Okay I will
11/12/23, 16:29 - Ananya: Now, can I know if you have a community building group or not?
11/12/23, 16:31 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: No we don't
11/12/23, 16:31 - Ananya: Can I know why?
11/12/23, 16:31 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: I really don't know
11/12/23, 16:32 - Ananya: Do you know about the community building group?
11/12/23, 16:32 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: No .
11/12/23, 16:33 - Ananya: Well, we must have discussed this in our EWYL group, do you remember that?
11/12/23, 16:34 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Yes I do
11/12/23, 16:38 - Ananya: Alright, so my first suggestion would be to create a group for yourself. Now, before that, would you like to share where you can find the potential students?
11/12/23, 16:39 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Firstly at my church because I'm in the youth group so I can start from there
11/12/23, 16:44 - Ananya: That's a good idea, apart from the church where do you find other students?
11/12/23, 16:46 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Around my area
11/12/23, 16:47 - Ananya: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:
11/12/23, 16:47 - Ananya: *Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
11/12/23, 16:48 - Ananya: *Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
11/12/23, 16:48 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Okay
11/12/23, 16:48 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: Okay

18/12/23, 16:04 - Ananya: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!ðŸŽ‰
18/12/23, 16:04 - Ananya: Edoofa is a *social-for-profit organization* that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunitiesâœ¨.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!
18/12/23, 16:05 - TEHILA EWYL23E0467: That's going to help me
18/12/23, 16:05 - Ananya: Edoofa scholarship program is currently helping over *100 schools in Africa*, and over *3000 African students* are benefiting from our scholarship program. The school principals and teachers who are playing a significant role in our program are enjoying exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Now, to help the students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation, Edoofa has its own Earn While You Learn Program, which helps the students to learn skills and earn money in the form of scholarship credits to reduce their expenses.ðŸ™Œ
18/12/23, 16:05 - Ananya: _Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that todayâ€™s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as countryâ€™s development/growth._
18/12/23, 16:05 - Ananya: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year.
