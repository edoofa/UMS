Just the act of committing to the effort makes us feel connected to everything and can help heal isolation, loneliness, and helplessness.
Hence in edoofa you can show your commitment and efforts by working on the projects we have, also *as a mentor I understand that projects have a dependency on others for example if some school head is responding or not, whether a company is interested or not etc but for activities and lessons you should keep the focus on top to shine in the community*
