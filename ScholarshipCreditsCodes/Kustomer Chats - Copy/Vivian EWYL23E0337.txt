27/07/23, 15:37 - Tenzin: Let us start our session with an inspiring story.
Embrace learning like Rahul, a poor but determined boy. Passing a library every day, he couldn't resist its allure. With borrowed books, he studied relentlessly, earning a scholarship to a prestigious school. Hard work won him a scholarship to a renowned university. But Rahul's journey didn't end there. He built libraries in his village, offering free education to underprivileged children. Let his story inspire you to never stop pursuing knowledge. Education is a powerful tool to transform your life and help others. Believe in yourself, embrace every opportunity to learn, and make today a day of growth.
