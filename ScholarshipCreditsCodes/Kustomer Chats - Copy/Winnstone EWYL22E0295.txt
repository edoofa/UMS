14/07/22, 18:27 - Winnstone EWYL22E0295: How are you sir ?
14/07/22, 18:27 - Winnstone EWYL22E0295: From yesterday's lesson, l was wowed by how Patrice turned his passion for mining into a very successful business. As mentioned that eagerness and zealousness and how it guided him in making choices which later led him to great success. I was also inspired by the hard work, perseverence and  determination he had when he was working on his dream. I also loved how he did not let his surroundings get the better of him but rather harness and take advantage of it. Growing up at in an environment like that can lead many astray but he used it to learn more about mining instead. Not giving up and being self made. We all know why we desire to be but we are afraid to try it which is what we all should try and fix and dare to give everything a try. I also admired how he grasped opportunities and made full use of them. Opportunity knocks only once in a lifetime and when they do we must make sure to take advantage of then like how Patrice did. I also learn that not having large business means success but even small businesses managing their finances well can be successful as well. Lastly l leant to be determined, have belief in myself and to strive towards my goals

20/07/22, 05:24 - Winnstone EWYL22E0295: Zimbabwe's economy is Agrarian based. Agriculture is one of if not the fastest growing sector in the country. Economic analysis states that there was an increase of more than 0.4% on the country's GDP due to an exceptionally good agriculture season in 2020. The strengths of Agriculture in Zimbabwe is mainly coupled by availability of fertile lands together with good climatic conditions for farming. Agriculture is also supported by the government through program like Command Agriculture in Zimbabwe. Manpower for caring out tasks is also available.  Agriculture boosts the GDP of the country, it creates a favourable BOP since other produce are exported and it also helping to reduce poverty, inflation and unemployment. However Agriculture has some weaknesses. Agriculture is in the primary sector and it's produce are cheaper than it's final products which the country will be exporting. Agriculture can be affected by weather especially during this climate change and it causes temporary unemployment during non-farming seasons. Agriculture is expected to reduce poverty in the future. Its also will reduce unemployment as people will be employed in farms. Its also going to increase the GDP of the country as well as aid in creating a favourable BOP. The main Agriculture is likely to be facing is climate change which hinders good agricultural progress. Labour will also be expensive this coming years. Land fertility will also decline and needs for improvising will arise

20/07/22, 21:45 - Unknown: Let me first help you understand what SWOT Analysis is.

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment.This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organisations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
