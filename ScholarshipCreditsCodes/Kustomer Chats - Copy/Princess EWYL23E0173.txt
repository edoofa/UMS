This individual has consistently demonstrated their dedication, determination, and unwavering commitment, becoming a true source of inspiration for you.

In your essay, please explore the key aspects of their life, experiences, and actions that exemplify their consistent nature. Describe how their consistent approach has positively influenced and impacted not only their own life but also the lives of those around them. Reflect on specific instances or situations where their consistent behavior or mindset has motivated you to strive for excellence or overcome challenges in your own life.

Feel free to include personal anecdotes, observations, or conversations that highlight the impact this person's consistency has had on your growth and development.

14/07/23, 15:48 - Ananya: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

Have you heard of the place where it rains throughout the year!!

Link: https://www.instagram.com/p/CupIRNzJuGk/

Check out this amazing fact for Factual Friday and tell us if you want to visit there in the comments below!
14/07/23, 15:49 - Princess EWYL23E0173: Yes i want to visit
14/07/23, 15:54 - Ananya: Great, so Princess may I ask if you were able to connect with any school head?
14/07/23, 16:45 - Princess EWYL23E0173: 
14/07/23, 16:52 - Ananya: Can you visit this school?
14/07/23, 17:01 - Princess EWYL23E0173: 
14/07/23, 17:02 - Ananya: This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
▪️With consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success
▪️Visiting schools physically can put a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
▪️With this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, leadership quality, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear to present himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.
