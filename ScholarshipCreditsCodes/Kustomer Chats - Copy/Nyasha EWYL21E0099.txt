Due to some medical emergency, I would not be able to take your session today.
But, nothing to worry about, I will do better after some time.
And by the time we have our next scheduled session, I want you to keep following the proud edoofian ritual.
Till then, have a great day.
And yes, we have our cultural festival tomorrow, named Raksha Bandhan. I want you to search for it, and if it gains your interest, we will surely discuss it in our next session.

How's your day going?
12/08/22, 22:20 - Unknown: Thank you for the wishes Nyasha.
I am doing better now, but still more to recover.
12/08/22, 22:21 - Unknown: Nyasha when I reviewed our previous talk, I was ecstatic to see how sincerely you had been practicing the ritual for the past week of remembering what it means to be a proud Edoofian. And I'd advise you to keep up this practice and make sure you never forget to write about the wonderful community you call home.
12/08/22, 22:22 - Unknown: Everyone aspires for success but have you ever felt that it comes easier to some than to others? Perhaps it's time for a new perspective!
There were 3 mantras that Ms. Davi explored in her weekly WEDNESDAY Wisdom.
So in our session today, we would:
1. discuss your outlook on the lesson, and what do you feel about it.
2. Choose a project of your choice and work on it in this month.
12/08/22, 22:22 - Unknown: You know from this month onwards, actually from this week, I and Ms. Davi, both were planning to award someone with 'BEST RESPONSE OF THE LESSON\/ACTIVITY'.
I specially recommended your name to her because I feel your understandings and outlook to these activities and lessons can change my mind, then it will definitely inspire others to change and change for good.
What do you think about it?
Do you think your response is good enough to bring you this title?

Keep working hard Nyasha.

How are you doing?
23/08/22, 22:23 - Unknown: I would like to share something with you. For all my students I am maintaining a personal report card so that each week I am able to give them a reflection on how they have performed, how many sessions have they attended, and how many responses have they submitted.
Please have a look at it, go through it, and share with me what can be done about it and how should we proceed.
I hope I am clear.
I am always there for all kinds of help, but yes, we really need to work on this.

12/07/22, 21:39 - Unknown: Greetings Nyasha!
How's your day going?
12/07/22, 21:41 - Unknown: Nyasha I have seen your records along with Ms. Davi, our HEAD COACH that you did not submit your last week's response, be it the Wednesday lesson and weekend activity that highlighted our ongoing project SKOOQS. May I know why?
If you are facing any challenges please let me know.
13/07/22, 02:31 - Nyasha EWYL21E0099: I accidentally cleared up this group's chat including a few more chats. Is it okay if you resend the tasks and I do them. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I should have told you, I was quite upset because I lost a lot of important stuff.
13/07/22, 21:04 - Unknown: Good afternoon Nyasha!
Don't worry I will resend it .
13/07/22, 21:06 - Unknown: But Nyasha , you have to submit your last week's responses first then only I will share with you this week's Wednesday lesson.
You know I went through this Wednesday's lesson and it is so interesting, I am sure you will find it so much thrilling.
13/07/22, 21:09 - Unknown: *WEDNESDAY LESSON  we have another dose of Wednesday wisdom on our most loved topic of Entrepreneurship. Yes, today’s lesson is going to talk about a sincere and passionate young female entrepreneur who has made her mark on the African Start up ecosystem. She is an award-winning UI\/UX Designer with seven years of experience working in the technology environment. We are talking about Oluwadamilola Soyombo, the founder of Skooqs. Today’s lesson will take us through the incident when Skooqs was born. I am sure a very valuable lesson is there for all of us to learn from. \u2028\u2028Also, I would like to highlight that Skooqs has partnered with Edoofa and will be working closely on providing our students with projects to work on and gain experience.  The first batch is already assigned the project. \u2028\u2028Go through the audio and pdf carefully and let me know if you have any concerns.
13/07/22, 21:13 - Unknown: *WEEKEND ACTIVITY- 09\/07\/2022*
\u2028\u2028You must have learned how critical it is to take advantage of every opportunity. In our Wednesday Wisdom this week, we discussed a profitable business- Skooqs. Do you know that Skooqs was developed in just five days!! Thanks to Oluwadamilola Soyombo's (Founder of Skooqs), diligence and use of the opportunity. The use of the opportunity at the right time with the right skills is currently creating a significant impact on the African entrepreneurial ecosystem.  And well some of you, because of your consistency, diligence, willingness to show up for your sessions, and performance in your weekly activities have gotten this opportunity to work on a project with Skooqs. 

You are probably aware of the possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. This week, I want you to think of a few skills or practices that a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits. 
Please list the skills that are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring in a lot of learning.
25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
