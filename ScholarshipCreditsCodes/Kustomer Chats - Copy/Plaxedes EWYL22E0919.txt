_Welcome to the first activity of the year!_
As part of today's Saturday activity, we invite you to share your personal experiences from any event you have attended, whether it be a seminar, workshop, or any other gathering. Our Wednesday lesson already highlighted the skills and experiences we can gain by our active participation in events that are aimed at sharing the Industry experience with young students.

Please take a moment to reflect on the event you attended, and share the key learnings, observations, and any memorable moments. Feel free to include pictures that capture the essence of the event.

For those who haven't had the chance to attend any events yet, don't worry! We encourage you to share your expectations from such gatherings. What do you hope to gain? What are your goals and aspirations when attending future events? This is a chance for you to articulate your thoughts and set intentions for your learning journey.

Remember, everyone's perspective is valuable, and by sharing our experiences, we create a supportive community that thrives on collaboration and shared knowledge. Let's make this Saturday activity a meaningful and insightful exchange of experiences and expectations. Thank you for your active participation!

Best regards,

Team EWYL
