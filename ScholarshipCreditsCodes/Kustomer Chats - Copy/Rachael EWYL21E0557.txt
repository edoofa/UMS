12/07/22, 18:49 - Unknown: Good Morning, Rachael
I hope that you are in good health and spirits
12/07/22, 18:49 - Unknown: I hope that you are aware about the Project 3?
12/07/22, 18:49 - Unknown: Also, While going through our conversation, I noticed that you haven't submitted the *Saturday's Lesson* yet.
The deadline to make the submission is *Tuesday* *3 PM*. Please make sure that you submit your response before that because the *Academic Board* keeps a very strict check on these things.

Our aim of this activity is to nurture and highlights the skills that are necessary for your career development and also for your enhanced performance in the EWYL Projects.

12/07/22, 18:55 - Rachael EWYL21E0557: No I'm not
12/07/22, 18:56 - Rachael EWYL21E0557: Ok

12/07/22, 19:07 - Unknown: May I know when will you be submitting it, Rachael?

12/07/22, 20:11 - Unknown: Let us start with our project discussion now, okay?
12/07/22, 20:11 - Unknown: So, May I know if you are aware about Project 3?
12/07/22, 22:01 - Rachael EWYL21E0557: Skills that are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring in a lot of learning.
 Students have to be able to think broadly and outside the box to be able to get projects that are challenging. Students also must be disciplined to be able to get such tasks. A student to get such tasks must be passionate about research and must also have development skills.  The student must be a responsible person, one who is able to undergo any challenge and most  of all, the student must  be goal oriented and goal driven person. Students must acquire certain skills such as punctuality and must be tasked.
The student must also have have interests to be able to get challenging projects.
12/07/22, 22:01 - Rachael EWYL21E0557: No I'm not aware
12/07/22, 22:19 - Unknown: Rachael, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.
This way you will always be recognized by the Academics Board for new projects.
12/07/22, 22:19 - Unknown: Let me help you with that.

25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:07 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:33 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

19/08/22, 19:35 - Unknown: Proud Edoofian, I must say that these past 2-3 weeks has taught me different aspects of life.

19/08/22, 19:35 - Unknown: It started with the arrival of around 100 energetic Edoofians who came from different parts of Africa. I loved how each student brought along a different story and a different experience. 

After spending almost 3 long weeks, Meeting our Edoofians, I must say that I have made lots of friends and in someway I am also motivated to see the potential these students have brought along.
19/08/22, 19:35 - Unknown: I hope that you will be with me on every step of this journey.
