04/10/22, 18:05 - Unknown: Hello, my dear Proud Edoofians,

This week we took a step back and reflected upon the objective of the EWYL program. We collectively reflected on why we should be regular with our projects, what these projects will help us earn, and how all of this will result in our individual financial independence.

Today, let's work on the next step which is to plan how to be financially independent by utilizing your time with the right projects. As an activity for this week, I want you to draft a document mentioning:

a)Target- no. of credits you want to earn in the month of October
b)How many projects can you work upon
c)Number of hours that you can devote to your projects
d)Name of the projects that you want to be a part of
e)Plan of action with your mentors

Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!

12/10/22, 18:18 - Unknown: Hello Proud Edoofian! I hope you are doing well.
13/10/22, 01:55 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.

Hope you are doing well. This week we learned about one of the most popular yet grounded people who used social media as a tool to become an educator and give back to the community and still become an entrepreneur.
This week I want you to reflect on what your strengths and skills are to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 

These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content etc.
Please share these skills and instances where you were able to showcase these skills in your next session.
Till then 
Happy Learning!

We were just told
03/11/22, 18:58 - Unknown: Hello Proud Edoofian! I hope you are doing well. Please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian'.
03/11/22, 19:55 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We all have come across the quote, \"Quitters Never Win, and Winners Never Quit\", and we also must have experienced this in our lives, directly or indirectly.

If last week's lesson, taught you the mindset of a winner, this week's lesson is going to teach you the true nature of a winner. Someone, who never gives up, or quits on the dream they see and really want to fulfill, no matter what. Moving through scorching heat, drenching rains, and heavy snow, they reach their destination and complete their journey. In this lesson, you will also learn, what happens when an entire community inherits this trait and keeps working on it. How recognition is earned and respect is gained through time, patience, and endless efforts.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

05/11/22, 17:11 - Unknown: Hello Proud Edoofian! I hope you are doing well.
05/11/22, 17:37 - Mungazi Alvin: Mr Siddi was hungry for knowledge and that made him willing to learn new things leading to success
05/11/22, 17:37 - Mungazi Alvin: I am proud Edoofian
05/11/22, 17:38 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
05/11/22, 18:16 - Unknown: Good to see you following ritual daily
