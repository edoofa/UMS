18/11/23, 16:17 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!

 Chandrayan-3 is the third Indian lunar exploration mission under the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chandrayaan program.

It was launched on 14 july, 2023, making India the first country to successfully land a spacecraft near the lunar south pole.
28/08/23, 13:09 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: Wow that is truly amazing. Congratulations to India as a country for the huge achievement.
28/08/23, 13:14 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: I have viewed the video.
28/08/23, 13:28 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: Hello
28/08/23, 13:29 - Ananya: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!
How are you doing?
28/08/23, 13:29 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: I am doing well and you.
28/08/23, 13:30 - Ananya: I am doing great! How was your weekend?
28/08/23, 13:31 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: The weekend was okay and you‚Äôre.
28/08/23, 13:31 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: *Yours
28/08/23, 13:32 - Ananya: Mine was also very beautiful! I had a lot of food.

Aug 28, 1:23 PM
28/08/23, 13:33 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: That‚Äôs splendid
28/08/23, 13:34 - Ananya: Now, I believe it is important to understand your priorities and interests. Therefore, I want to begin by asking which of those three EWYL projects, you liked the most?
28/08/23, 13:38 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: The project I liked the most was that of approaching schools and giving them intel on Edoofa and also approaching the students.
28/08/23, 13:41 - Ananya: That's lovely! So may I ask if you have any plans for doing your favorite project?
28/08/23, 13:42 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: Yes I do.
28/08/23, 13:45 - Ananya: That's amazing! Would you like to share it with me?
28/08/23, 13:48 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: Yes I would.


Well seeing that we are about to end our winter break and resume with school, I found that it would be easier to connect with the school heads and students when they are all at school rather than when they home and probably busy. By approaching them at school I am able to schedule meetings between the school head and tell them of how I have been helped by Edoofa and how it can also help other students in taking their education higher.
28/08/23, 13:50 - Ananya: That's amazing Takunda!
-Let me share with you how our star performer for the last week-Loice did complete her targets.
She shared three schools and you know she got to know about them through Google.
She simply searched on Google like 'School nearby'/'School in Harare'/'School in Manicaland' and so on. She was able to yield results.
So even without physically visiting them, she got to know about them through Google, got their contact details, and after that got in touch with them Via WhatsApp.
3)  please reach out to all your friends, peers, cousins, neighbors, school mates, to get their School Head's contact details.
4)  visit schools in your province, physical visits can add another touch to the conversations and make them a lot more impactful.
28/08/23, 13:52 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: That is truly amazing and helpful. Thank you for the helping hand.
28/08/23, 13:54 - Ananya: This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success
‚ñ™Ô∏èVisiting schools physically can put a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, leadership quality, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear to present himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.
28/08/23, 13:55 - Ananya: .
28/08/23, 13:56 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: Wow truly amazing, this is inspiring
28/08/23, 14:03 - Ananya: Now, Blessing, in order to maintain a specific credit balance in your account and ensure your active participation, I will create a personalized target table for you. Before doing that, I need to evaluate your performance. To accomplish this, I'm assigning you a small target, and I hope you will be able to excel at it. Are you up for this?
28/08/23, 14:04 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: It‚Äôs Takunda and yes I am up for it.
28/08/23, 14:09 - Ananya: Kindly excuse me for the same, You have to submit 1 school form by connecting with a school by Thursday, is that alright?
28/08/23, 14:10 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: When you say school form what do you mean

31/08/23, 13:14 - Ananya: I am good. So may I ask if you were able to read the newsletter?
31/08/23, 13:35 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: Yes I was

31/08/23, 13:45 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: I learnt that the 3 quotes motivate one not to be limited by way they can‚Äôt do but to strive to be the best and to exceed their limits and expectations. I also understood that sincerity is a quality that reflects honesty and truthfulness in one‚Äôs thoughts and actions. I learnt that sincere people are genuine. I learnt sincerity is valued in relationships , communication, leadership, personal growth and professionalism.
31/08/23, 13:57 - Ananya: Amazing, so may I ask if you were able to connect with any school?
31/08/23, 14:01 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: No I wasn‚Äôt, the schools I got in touch with said they were busy preparing for the opening of schools on Monday hence they said I should pay them a visit on Tuesday after they have opened schools
31/08/23, 14:04 - Ananya: Alright, that's great! 
You know, recently we had a meeting with Angad Sir, and as a whole team, we were planning to introduce some external projects! I'm sharing this information with my students early because these external projects will be considered as valuable experience when they pursue their future dream jobs!
These projects will only be offered to students who have excelled in the EWYL journey and previous projects, as they demonstrate dedication and consistency. So, I think it's essential for us to start preparing as soon as possible. Together, we will brainstorm creative ways to maintain our positive reputation and excellent record. What are your thoughts on this?
31/08/23, 14:20 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: This is truly amazing for me and my other fellow edoofians
31/08/23, 14:20 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: It is a way to showcase hardworking students
31/08/23, 14:21 - Ananya: Indeed, last year when students came to India, only well-performing students were offered some amazing projects and had the opportunity to work with renowned brands like Sirona!
Therefore, I want you to be proactive and consistent with your EWYL projects so that you can uphold your reputation in the EWYL department. This way, when an external project comes up, your name will immediately come to mind as a top candidate. Keep up the hard work, and you'll create more opportunities for yourself in the future!
31/08/23, 14:22 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: Will definitely do so
31/08/23, 14:23 - Ananya: Now, get ready because our next session is going to be super exciting! We'll dive deeper into this topic and explore some fantastic ideas on how you can maintain unwavering consistency in your projects. It's crucial that we collaborate and devise a new plan of action to achieve our goals together! So, gear up and bring your creativity and enthusiasm to the table because we're going to make amazing progress! Get pumped! üöÄ
31/08/23, 14:23 - Takunda EWYL23E0258: Will bring my A game
