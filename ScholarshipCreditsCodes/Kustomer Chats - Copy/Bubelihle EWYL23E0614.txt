So, are you ready to start our session?
28/09/23, 13:10 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: Yes, l am.
28/09/23, 13:12 - Aditi Kapoor: Let's begin by exploring your understanding of the lesson on Wednesday.
28/09/23, 13:20 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: On Wednesday lesson, l learnt that the lesson is designed for students to learn new skills and experiences which help students become more creative and discover their true selves. I learnt about importance of time management during exam season. That as students if we are time conscious, we maximize productivity by accomplishing a lot of things and it also helps reduce stress and anxiety, as if me as a student l don't manage time accordingly, l will end up procrastinating, this hindering my performance. 
I also learnt about how to manage time through creating efficient study schedule, allocating specific time slots for the modules l want to study on that particular date, and by including breaks as they help rejuvenate my mind. I learnt to manage time by setting clear goals of what l want to do as they help me stay focused and motivated,  also clear goals help me stay organized.
28/09/23, 13:24 - Aditi Kapoor: It's great to hear your reflections from Wednesday's lesson. Understanding the importance of time management is a crucial skill, not only during the exam season but throughout life. I'm pleased to see that you're already recognizing the benefits it can bring to your productivity and overall well-being as a student.
28/09/23, 13:25 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: Yes,  it is important to manage time , especially if one wants to excel.
28/09/23, 13:26 - Aditi Kapoor: That is true!
28/09/23, 13:30 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: Yes, it is.
28/09/23, 13:36 - Aditi Kapoor: Alright, so now let's have a discussion on your project's.
28/09/23, 13:36 - Aditi Kapoor: Please brief me about the same.
28/09/23, 13:40 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: Okay.
28/09/23, 13:42 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, I am waiting for your response.
28/09/23, 13:46 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: EWYL projects assigned to me by the help of my mentor are not that hard but  creating a community of students seems to be taking  longer than l expected cause most rely on their parents response first, however l will be patient . Then about the one of connecting with school heads, l have selected a few schools whose fees are above $100, one of the school is Sobukhazi High School were l was learning. I'm still waiting for the response from the school head .
28/09/23, 13:47 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: Then for live and real time projects, l am waiting for guidance from my mentor on how l do it.
28/09/23, 13:49 - Aditi Kapoor: Amazing Bubelihle!
So can you please share the screenshots of the conversation with the school headmaster whom you reached out to.
28/09/23, 13:55 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: Sorry, l didn't communicate with him through WhatsApp l visited the school since it was near my home area. For he said he will get back to me .
28/09/23, 13:56 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: Also l have created the group , were l will be interacting with the students.
28/09/23, 13:57 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, just one suggestion make sure that you have some conversation done on WhatsApp as proof regarding the projects, otherwise it would be difficult for me to track your progress and guide you.
28/09/23, 13:58 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: Yes, will do so . Will communicate with him through WhatsApp. Thank you for the guidance
28/09/23, 13:59 - Aditi Kapoor: Bubelihle, I am actually impressed that you visited the school I am just telling you to at least have some conversation on WhatsApp.
28/09/23, 14:00 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: Well noted

04/10/23, 13:51 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofians,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning

05/10/23, 13:14 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: Good morning, yes  l am.
05/10/23, 13:16 - Aditi Kapoor: Superb!
05/10/23, 13:16 - Aditi Kapoor: So I hope you have had the chance to understand the Wednesday Lesson, and I am intrigued to know what mental changes will you make so that you may control your circumstances rather than letting them control you.
05/10/23, 13:21 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: Yes, l did go through the Newsletter and Wednesday lesson. I learnt that as a student when you are in the right direction, you have opportunities which others cannot even imagine, hence as students we must master our circumstances rather than to be ruled by them. I also got inspiration from Swarna AKhter story who is a proud EDOOFIAN and one of the few Bangladesh to be part of the prestigious scholarship, as l learnt that anything is possible.

05/10/23, 13:24 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: Also l learnt that sense of belongingness is essential to one's success as it provides motivation, great support system, wisdom, accountability, this helping students to achieve their goals effectively,making them vibrant and dynamic in student community.
05/10/23, 13:28 - Aditi Kapoor: I'm glad to hear that you've gone through the Newsletter and the Wednesday lesson. It's excellent that you've drawn valuable insights from them. Your observation about the importance of a sense of belongingness is insightful. It truly can provide motivation, support, wisdom, and accountability, fostering a vibrant and dynamic student community. Keep up the positive mindset!
05/10/23, 13:30 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: Thank you.
05/10/23, 13:32 - Aditi Kapoor: So may I know the update on the Schools project were you able to get the form filled by the School Head?
05/10/23, 13:41 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: Some of the schools l selected around my area are government schools and their fees structure is not above 100$,  l wanted to go to Pumula High and l heard their fees is 80$ , Entumbane High is also less . Will select other schools which are located in the low density suburbs as their fees cost above 250$ going  upwards but it's going to be a little bit hard to reach out to the principals there.
05/10/23, 13:46 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: Ms Aditi, how do l do the live and real time projects.
05/10/23, 13:56 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, I really appreciate that!
But before moving forward may I know if you were able to get a response from your school head?
As about the other schools whose fees is near $100 you can connect with the headmaster and make a group and ask them to find students who would be interested in pursuing their education in India.
05/10/23, 13:58 - Aditi Kapoor: And Bubelihle, if you can reach out to the schools whose fees is around $250, then it would be superb for you, if reaching out to the school headmaster is difficult try reaching out to the teachers or an in-charge of the school who can connect the headmaster with you.
05/10/23, 14:00 - Bubelihle EWYL23E0614: Thanks ma'am, will try connecting with the teachers
