Journal Day 1
First day of journalling. I'm excited to start this journey because I believe it'll make me a better person. Learning to express my plans, feelings, ideas, and emotions through the art of writing everything in my mind.

at this point, i feel like I'm on the right track. I had a long phase of depression that had me by the neck. funny I'm feeling better already. depression taught me so much, and as much as i was about to give up, my life turned around. i landed a scholarship with edoofa, an Indian education board, I got a job and I passed my exams and graduated with an advanced diploma.

everything seems to be working out. I'm feeling happier, more open to new journeys and friendships, my family is in the right place. i just love how life is going right now.
08/11/23, 14:21 - Aditi Kapoor: Can you explain as you have to carry out the community building project on Whatsapp only right?
08/11/23, 14:22 - Sandra EWYL23E0767: Ok ok.... You mean this one where I have to create a group and add students...I did create it maam
08/11/23, 14:25 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, great!
Any progress on that?
08/11/23, 14:26 - Sandra EWYL23E0767: Yes I have some students who filled the forms have been wanting to ask...where do I submit the forms
08/11/23, 14:27 - Aditi Kapoor: You shall submit them on the EWYL Group to me.
08/11/23, 14:30 - Sandra EWYL23E0767: First day of journaling

It's been a tough week for me. Spending the whole day sleeping with nothing to do but I am happy a friend's birthday is coming up I will get something that will occupy me and free me from deep thinking. I am really looking  to being happy on that  day.

Despite me spending the whole day sleeping I'm excited about one thing it keeps me away from trouble or doing any activity that is illegal. Sometimes I wish I was in school already cause sleeping the whole day is really boring but however I am content that it is God's plan. Everything happens for a reason
08/11/23, 14:30 - Sandra EWYL23E0767: Noted
08/11/23, 14:32 - Aditi Kapoor: Sandra, your journal entry captures a desire for more activity and engagement, with anticipation for an upcoming friend's birthday to provide a welcome change. Despite days of rest, the writer recognizes that everything happens for a reason, embracing this time for introspection and growth.
08/11/23, 14:33 - Sandra EWYL23E0767: Yes
08/11/23, 14:34 - Aditi Kapoor: I saw the forms on the group, good work.

08/11/23, 14:35 - Aditi Kapoor: Concluding our session, I want to express how delightful our conversation has been and now I am sharing this week's Wednesday lesson with you.
08/11/23, 14:35 - Aditi Kapoor: Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.
