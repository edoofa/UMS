He is someone who is eager to learn more and more and with a I can do anything Spirit that motivates him to always work hard. Patrice is someone who never quits even when things seem to be tough, he was able to make very tough and difficult decisions. Decision making skills that were used by him at the start of his business shows that he was confident in himself and this confidence is really needed in business.

19/07/22, 19:50 - JOSEPH EWYL22E0067: Weekend Response 

The real estate industry is finding its way back to being a very profitable business in Zimbabwe. The economy of Zimbabwe is now rising and this rise in the economy is giving a very big boost to this business sector, the introduction of the Zimbabwe dollar as the main legal tender for transactions caused a depreciation in the business since before houses were being sold in USD. The buying and selling of properties is coming back to its height in Zimbabwe and obviously now it will be very profitable since more upgraded properties are now being made and also people will always be building and be in need of some property. Real estate investors make money in numerous ways e.g through rental income, appreciation and profits generated from the business activities. Cash flow is the net income from a real estate investment after mortgage payments and operating expenses have been made , cash flow strengthens over time. In real estate sector money flows in the business since investors can take advantage of tax breaks and deductions that can save money at tax time, real estate investors make money through rental payment and appreciation, since modest houses are fast emerging in Zimbabwe the cost of rent is increasing meaning to say more money can be made from rental payments. In the real estate business as an agent one should make use of the following strengths so that business can grow e,g market knowledge, market enterprise,community connection and also making a good name in the business so that customers can always trust you with their properties. Positive online reviews and testimonials will increase the customer rate in an estate business and will also make people to simply try your business. If you are to make a name in the real estate sector you should make customers needs your first priority, making use of good marketing skills and the positive reviews from customers. 

This sector cannot be profitable especially if one has a small sph

19/07/22, 20:55 - Tenzin: Amazing to read your response for the weekend activity. I like how you chose this particular industry and how you have explained about it's growth in the time to come.
19/07/22, 20:55 - Tenzin: Let me first help you understand what SWOT Analysis is.

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment.This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organisations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
19/07/22, 21:16 - JOSEPH EWYL22E0067: Okay sir I understand
19/07/22, 21:48 - Tenzin: Joseph,As seen above, SWOT is an acronym of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. However, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym:

1 Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
2 Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
3 Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
4 Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by
19/07/22, 21:49 - JOSEPH EWYL22E0067: Okay sir
19/07/22, 22:14 - Tenzin: You know why SWOT Analysis is important? It can help you to challenge risky assumptions and to uncover dangerous blindspots about your organization's performance. If you use it carefully and collaboratively, it can deliver new insights on where your business currently is, and help you to develop exactly the right strategy for any situation.
19/07/22, 22:14 - Tenzin: For example, you may be well aware of some of your organization's strengths, but until you record them alongside weaknesses and threats you might not realize how unreliable those strengths actually are.

Equally, you likely have reasonable concerns about some of your business weaknesses but, by going through the analysis systematically, you could find an opportunity, previously overlooked, that could more than compensate.
19/07/22, 22:35 - JOSEPH EWYL22E0067: Yes that’s very true
19/07/22, 23:14 - Tenzin: Now, What Are the Biggest SWOT Analysis Mistakes that people make?
19/07/22, 23:26 - JOSEPH EWYL22E0067: Please tell me sir
19/07/22, 23:58 - Tenzin: joseph, I believe that people make the following mistakes:
1 Making your lists too long. Ask yourself if your ideas are feasible as you go along.
2 Being vague. Be specific to provide more focus for later discussions.
3. Not seeing weaknesses. Be sure to ask customers and colleagues what they experience in real life.
4. Not thinking ahead. It's easy to come up with nice ideas without taking them through to their logical conclusion. Always consider their practical impact.
5 Being unrealistic. Don't plan in detail for opportunities that don't exist yet.
19/07/22, 23:59 - JOSEPH EWYL22E0067: Yes that’s true
20/07/22, 00:13 - Tenzin: Joseph, Here is a video that teaches you how you can implement SWOT Analysis in your work, business and career.

21/07/22, 18:52 - JOSEPH EWYL22E0067: Wednesday Response 

Success is driven by the willingness to be successful, you cannot be successful if you are not willing to work hard for that success. As a person one should make an effort to try rather than to quit before losing, many people do not want to fail they tend to forget that in order for a person to do right he has to learn from the mistakes he made. The difference between a successful person and an unsuccessful person is that successful people take responsibility whereas other people want to blame others for their mistakes. Have a mindset of a winner half a loaf is better than nothing don’t be scared of losing .

21/07/22, 20:39 - Tenzin: Good to read your response on this lesson Joseph! I am glad that you were able to understand the crux of that which is that successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it.
