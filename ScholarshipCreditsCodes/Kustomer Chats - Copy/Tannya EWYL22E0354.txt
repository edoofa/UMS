How are you?
07/10/22, 21:57 - Saloni Rastogi: As students, we constantly learn and expose ourselves to situations that help us learn anything and everything, but we must remember that each of us has the same number of hours in a day. Hence we must treat it important that we treat our Time as the currency of life. *Time Management* is essentially Priority Management.

In our session today on the *EWYL Line*, we will discuss:
1. How managing time is necessary
2. pending discussion on the weekend activity
07/10/22, 21:58 - Saloni Rastogi: You said in your weekend activity response that you want to earn more than $100 for this month, may I know how are you planning to do that?
07/10/22, 21:59 - Tannya EWYL22E0354: Oky

How are you?
12/10/22, 01:42 - Saloni Rastogi: In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. 
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic *\" Study In India\"*
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. Those unfamiliar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
In today's session on the EWYL Line, we will discuss:
1. your video
2.  project analysis

Please excuse me for the delay caused in the session, I was got occupied with some personal engagements.
I hope we can continue now.
12/10/22, 01:43 - Saloni Rastogi: The video has one thing that caught my attention, and that was your constant smile and happiness I guess it's the topic that touched everyone and students are speaking from their hearts about how beautiful this journey can be and how impatiently everyone is waiting to come here. A similar thing is also reflected in your video as well.
12/10/22, 14:43 - Tannya EWYL22E0354: Good morning
12/10/22, 14:43 - Tannya EWYL22E0354: I am good and you

12/10/22, 14:44 - Tannya EWYL22E0354: ? thank you
14/10/22, 01:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Tannya!
How are you?
14/10/22, 01:28 - Saloni Rastogi: We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In the session on the EWYL Line, we will:
1) discuss on the Wednesday lesson
14/10/22, 01:28 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, I have an amazing opportunity for you, but I will share with you only when you will share with me what you have learned from the Wednesday lesson.
I have this opportunity reserved just for you, exclusively for my bright students.
14/10/22, 03:00 - Tannya EWYL22E0354: Greetings
14/10/22, 03:00 - Tannya EWYL22E0354: Sorry for replying late

How are you?
20/10/22, 21:45 - Saloni Rastogi: I am happy to tell you that this weekend we are having our great Indian festival, Deepawali and you know this festival holds a special place in the hearts of all Indian families. So yesterday, everyone in our office wore Ethnic dresses and celebrate Deepawali's party where we exchanged gifts and lit up the office with diyas and candles.
Due to this, there was a delay in sending you the Wednesday lesson for this week.
Please see to it and we will have a session tomorrow on the same because I want to give you time to ponder and work on it.
20/10/22, 21:45 - Saloni Rastogi: In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.
21/10/22, 22:08 - Tannya EWYL22E0354: Greetings

I am excited to discuss both things with you!

How did your weekend go?

This weekend's activity gave you a first-hand experience to fit yourselves in a small part of the leadership shoes. I wanted you to create a newsletter of your own. Similar to the ones you have enjoyed reading every Sunday from the founder's office.

In our session, we will discuss:
1) the newsletter that you have designed for the weekend activity
07/11/22, 21:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, I hope you remember that:
