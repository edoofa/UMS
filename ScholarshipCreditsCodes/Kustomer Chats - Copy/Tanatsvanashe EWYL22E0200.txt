18/07/22, 19:18 - Tanatsvanashe EWYL22E0200: Wednesday Wisdom 6th July.  

    Well,Oluwadamilola Soyombo has become my role model from this day going onwards,how incredible that she developed Skooqs in five days. This lady has highlighted to us that,diligence along with utilisation of an opportunity can make one's dream and vision come true or turn into reality. Not only these factors, but hardwork, passion and dedication can make our dreams possible. 

Her story just quenched my thirsty and answered some wonderous questions that were bombarding in my head.The fact that she is a lady, gives me strength, Courage and hope that anyone is capable of achieving what he or she needs as long as dedicated, passionate and making use of the opportunity at the right time with the right skills and knowledge.

Skills that are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring a lot of learning include:
1)Communication skills-where one must be good in communication and is able to understand what he or she is supposed to do at the right time using right skills,right resources and  knowledge.
2)Entrepreneurial skills and knowledge- where one should be aware of types of industries that are flourishing or declining, reasons behind, type of services they offer and other things of significance offered by those businesses
18/07/22, 19:21 - Tanatsvanashe EWYL22E0200: Morever one should be aware of the skills and knowledge on the background of the business, it's intention of existing and any other. Also,one should be digitally and technologically skilled so that he\/she is ready to face any business pending tasks since our world is dynamic and the technology is advancing,hence one should be geared.

19/07/22, 00:00 - Unknown: Please share the response Tanatsvanashe.
19/07/22, 00:56 - Tanatsvanashe EWYL22E0200: ?? I sent this and Iam working on the Saturday activity that I will be soon sharing with you sir.
19/07/22, 00:56 - Tanatsvanashe EWYL22E0200: Due to its conducive, rich and favourable geological conditions as well as generally well-qualified and skilled labour, in combination with a well reasonably well developed infrastructure and it's central location in Africa,Zimbabwe is an attractive destination for all entrepreneurs, especially in Mining,which is the fastest  growing industry\/sector in Zimbabwe.

Mining contributes to about 60% of exports since past years comparative to other sectors such as agricultural sector which was once the leading when Zimbabwe was referred to as\"bread basket\" of Southern Africa.

Mining contributes to foreign exchange through exportation of raw materials and semi-finished mined goods where foreign currency is generated, GDP is increased as the government raises revenue which can be used in infrastructure development such as schools, hospitals and public facilities which are utilised and are of beneficial to locals hence improving their standards of living.

Furthermore,mining provides raw materials to industries thus industries grow as they process raw materials into finished or semi-finished goods for customers. In Zimbabwe, mining has opened doors for anyone that is more job opportunities are being created and employment is created.
Market for selling minerals is available and foreign currency is being made.Moreover,loyal customers who are willing to buy minerals or processed foods from Zimbabwe are readily available.

However, mining incorporates and take into account so many risks,threats and weakness. Initially, mining imposes negative impact on the environment such as land degradation which leaves permanent scars on the natural landscapes.Externalities such as pollution affect locals .The  environment becomes an eyesore if the industries dumps chemical waste,dumped heaps,unclosed pits and trenches which can cost lives.Lives are lost if there is an earth tremor or earth movement due to mining.

Also,due to stiff competition on the market from co

19/07/22, 01:07 - Unknown: Amazing to read your response for the weekend activity. I like how you chose this particular industry and how you have explained about it's growth in the time to come. Keep it up.
19/07/22, 01:07 - Unknown: Also Tanatsvanashe, Let me first help you understand what SWOT Analysis is.

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment.This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organisations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
19/07/22, 01:07 - Tanatsvanashe EWYL22E0200: Thank you,sir.
19/07/22, 01:07 - Tanatsvanashe EWYL22E0200: I am a proud Edoofian.
19/07/22, 01:09 - Tanatsvanashe EWYL22E0200: Noted ,sir.
19/07/22, 01:09 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

19/07/22, 01:13 - Unknown: As seen above, SWOT is an acronym of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. However, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym:

1 Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
2 Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
3 Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
4 Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by
19/07/22, 01:13 - Tanatsvanashe EWYL22E0200: Noted
19/07/22, 01:18 - Unknown: You know why SWOT Analysis is important? It can help you to challenge risky assumptions and to uncover dangerous blindspots about your organization's performance. If you use it carefully and collaboratively, it can deliver new insights on where your business currently is, and help you to develop exactly the right strategy for any situation.
19/07/22, 01:18 - Unknown: For example, you may be well aware of some of your organization's strengths, but until you record them alongside weaknesses and threats you might not realize how unreliable those strengths actually are.

Equally, you likely have reasonable concerns about some of your business weaknesses but, by going through the analysis systematically, you could find an opportunity, previously overlooked, that could more than compensate.
