12/07/22, 21:15 - Unknown: Can you please share the conversation that you had with them?
12/07/22, 21:56 - Unknown: Also, While going through our conversation, I noticed that you haven't submitted the Saturday's Lesson yet.
The deadline to make the submission is Tuesday 3 PM. Please make sure that you submit your response before that because the Academic Board keeps a very strict check on these things.

Our aim of this activity is to nurture and highlights the skills that are necessary for your career development and also for your enhanced performance in the EWYL Projects.
12/07/22, 22:25 - Patrick EWYL21E0734: Sir may I have extension please
12/07/22, 22:32 - Unknown: Sure, Patrick.
When do you want to make the submission?
12/07/22, 23:18 - Patrick EWYL21E0734: I got busy so I haven't read it yet
12/07/22, 23:19 - Patrick EWYL21E0734: Let me do that tomorrow
13/07/22, 09:55 - Patrick EWYL21E0734: Skills needed by students are
1)critical thinking and problem solving skills - these skills can be developed by seeing problems from different angles and formulating their own solutions, regardless of the field they choose to enter their career,the ability to think and act quickly is an indispensable tool for the future
2)Accessing and analysing information - students have access to unimaginable amounts of information today. The Internet provides an incredible research tool that can be their best friend or worste enemy. Accessing information tends to be easy but more complicated, they need to know the difference between factual information and factual sounding options.
3)curiosity and imagination - students are naturally curious about their world and wanting to explore it. Their imaginations are vast and untamed, creating endless amounts of practical and impractical things.
4)Agility and adaptability - students need to be comfortable with the idea of change and be willing to adapt to the changes around them.
5)Written communication - students need to know the difference between formal and informal writing as it is quite important for the students to learn and start applying
6)Collaboration across network and leading influences - understanding that not every person is born a natural leader. However the ability to lead others can definitely help a person to advance and become successful in their chosen career. Also finding a job where you don't need to be able to work closely and harmoniously with others can be quite a difficult task
13/07/22, 09:56 - Patrick EWYL21E0734: Good morning I am a proud edoofian
13/07/22, 09:57 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
13/07/22, 16:36 - Unknown: Good Morning, Patrick
I hope that you are doing well
13/07/22, 16:37 - Unknown: Patrick, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.
This way you will always be recognized by the Academics Board for new projects.

15/07/22, 21:30 - Unknown: That's Great!
May I know how are you doing that?
This way I would be able to share some insights with you.
15/07/22, 21:30 - Patrick EWYL21E0734: What I have learned and understood from Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe success story:1)He keept moving forward and continued to fantasise - because he realised that business was his true calling. The essential thing is to keep moving, working and expanding rather than standing stagnant
2)He followed his dream and money followed - what is far more important is that you persue your aspirations and hobbies. Mr Motsepe did things that thrilled him and he was incredibly successful because he combined them with hard effort and sacrifice. He concentrated on what he was most passionate about and endured in the face of adversity.
3)he believed in his business idea and persevered because he focused and did things he was most passionate about and he loved the most and did not get discouraged. Persevere and believe in the viability and long term success of the business you want to start
15/07/22, 21:31 - Patrick EWYL21E0734: I am looking for students at Facebook and also asking my friends and relatives if they have some who are interested
15/07/22, 21:34 - Unknown: I am very happy after going through your response. ?
Proud Edoofians, These are the footsteps that we have to follow. The traits that he gained and possessed are not something that could be taught in schools\/ universities. That is why our head coach, Ms. Davi, tries that through every lesson you are able to get one step closer towards gaining these traits and making your career sucessful.
15/07/22, 21:34 - Unknown: This is the right approach.
Please tell me if you require any help from my side, okay?
15/07/22, 21:35 - Unknown: Should we move to Project 3 now?
15/07/22, 21:35 - Patrick EWYL21E0734: Ok
15/07/22, 21:35 - Unknown: Also, Patrick, My system shows that you haven't performed in the EWYL Projects since May 2022.
Is this information right?
