"Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life." - Steve Jobs

Steve Jobs' quote emphasizes the preciousness of time and encourages us to live authentically. It reminds us to prioritize our own passions and pursuits rather than conforming to external expectations.

"Your present circumstances don't determine where you can go; they merely determine where you start." - Nido Qubein

This profound quote encourages us to see our current situation as a starting point, not a limitation. It emphasizes the limitless potential for growth, learning, and transformation, regardless of our current circumstances.

09/12/23, 16:27 - Malvin EWYL23E0604: SATURDAY ACTIVITY
09/12/23, 18:40 - Unknown: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!
12/12/23, 15:55 - Malvin EWYL23E0604: Hello Ms Sharda
12/12/23, 15:57 - Unknown: Good afternoon Malvin

Let's kick off today's session with a quote from the tech maestro, Sundar Pichai:
"Success is not about the destination. It's about the journey."

🌟 What it Means:
Imagine your favorite video game. Sure, finishing a level is awesome, but the real joy? It's in navigating the challenges, learning new skills, and enjoying the process.
12/12/23, 15:58 - Unknown: I hope you are aware that you are very late for the session. From next time please ensure you are joining the session well within time. You joining in late restricts our learning.
12/12/23, 15:58 - Malvin EWYL23E0604: Okay sorry for that
12/12/23, 16:11 - Unknown: It is alright. Please do not repeat this.
12/12/23, 16:11 - Unknown: *Before we move forward, I would like you to submit your response of the Saturday Activity  that was shared with you on saturday*
12/12/23, 16:29 - Malvin EWYL23E0604: Understood
12/12/23, 16:43 - Unknown: Where is your response to the Saturday Activity?
12/12/23, 16:43 - Unknown: Let us now shift our attention, give me an honest update on the project work.
Have you started to work on both the Community Building and African School Reforms Project. ?

How many students have you interacted with so far? How are you planning to increase the number of students and the student application forms?


Answer the question explaining the progress of each project one by one.
12/12/23, 16:44 - Unknown: Malvin, I am still waiting for your response.
12/12/23, 17:02 - Unknown: I would now like to end our session, since the time is already over.
Here is a target for you for the community Building Project.
You have to connect with at least 20-25 students and submit 15 student application forms before our next session.
Kindly try connecting with at least 5 schools and submit at least 2-3 school forms.

If the target is not reached, I would be more than happy to understand the possible reasons but you have to work on the projects.
12/12/23, 20:55 - Malvin EWYL23E0604: Sorry the network from my side is bad as soon as I get to good network I'll forward
20/12/23, 15:19 - Malvin EWYL23E0604: Good morning

16/01/24, 16:55 - Unknown: Malvin, please be punctual in your sessions from next time. You are just a few months away from coming to India and if you will not be regular in your EWYL sessions, you will also miss out on your earning and learning opportunities. Please understand that if you will be committed to work on your project during your time here in Africa, in no time you will be able to have enough scholarship credits that you can very well utilize in your first year's fee.
16/01/24, 16:55 - Unknown: Our session is wrapped up for today. I wish you a wonderful day ahead. Please start maintaining your enthusiasm and eagerness to learn as we progress on this transformative path.

Have a lovely day!
