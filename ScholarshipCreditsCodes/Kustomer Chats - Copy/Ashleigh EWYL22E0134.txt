I will send you the *newsletter* so that you can go through it by the next session which is on *Friday*.

3 things to make a mental note  sure you send  am a proud edoofian everyday*
I will take an update on the project *Community building*
Make sure you collect your *weekly lesson\/task*
12/07/22, 18:32 - Unknown: Your sessions are on Tuesday's and Friday's [ not Thursday's ]
12/07/22, 23:05 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: Alright understood
12/07/22, 23:08 - Unknown: I will just share the newsletter with you
12/07/22, 23:21 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: Noted 
I will peruse it through
12/07/22, 23:25 - Unknown: Ashleigh, did you work on the community building project?
12/07/22, 23:26 - Unknown: I informed you of a strategy as well.
12/07/22, 23:45 - Unknown: So, you created this with the help of a school?
12/07/22, 23:56 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: Yes. 
After a while the school then informed me that Edoofa has approached them directly and Mr Shubham was then added to the group
13/07/22, 15:07 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: Good morning ma'am I am a proud Edoofian
13/07/22, 15:08 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Let us start our day with a quote  is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence*
14/07/22, 00:45 - Unknown: It's time for Wednesday Wisdom, and this week we're going to learn how the son of a former teacher in an African school made over $1 billion dollars. You did read it correctly.
When I read the lesson, I personally learned a lot. In the lecture, some of the top success secrets are revealed.

Be sure to thoroughly read the PDF document, and if you choose, you can note down things that you liked or were inspired by and we can discuss them in our session on *Thursday- 10 AM*

Happy studying!
14/07/22, 03:03 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: What is not attainable?
14/07/22, 03:03 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: Received

14/07/22, 18:39 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian,
Please give me update on the Weekly activity edoofian,

Rest of the things we will discuss during your session.
14/07/22, 19:17 - Unknown: We have your slot today at *12:00 PM [ Zimbabwe time ]*.

I will tell you about the *4 points of contacts*  we have an EWYL week.


Also, we will discuss your missed Wednesday lesson!
14/07/22, 21:06 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: Good afternoon ma'am.
14/07/22, 21:07 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: I have been pre occupied since to read your messages.
Which activity are you referring to?
14/07/22, 21:10 - Unknown: The Wednesday Wisdom I sent you yesterday.
14/07/22, 21:15 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: Yes i went through it. One of many inspiring stories of people of color doing quite well in a predominantly white society
14/07/22, 22:23 - Unknown: I am glad the lesson was able to inspire you. Could you please share a bit of your understanding for this?
14/07/22, 22:26 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: I understand that opportunities and inspirations are found in the  least expected ways and places. It also goes on to speak to how most people simply give up just because they do not belong but in this case indifference was the key to succeeding  of course together with hard work and correct strategies.
14/07/22, 22:29 - Unknown: Right, also it mentions that you do not always need a teacher to succeed but you already have one so why not gauge that opportunity Ashleigh!
14/07/22, 22:32 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: I'm always greatful for having opportunities and do my best to live up to standard
14/07/22, 22:37 - Unknown: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e, you will be having 2 sessions on selected days. On Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
Sounds interesting, right?
14/07/22, 22:38 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: Very eventful  but definitely interesting

Let us start our day with this beautiful quote  got to get up every morning with determination if you’re going to go to bed with satisfaction.” – George Lorimer
18/07/22, 18:50 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: Noted ✅
18/07/22, 18:50 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: In Zimbabwe, as much as we would like to believe that beauty is skin deep, it is inevitable that in the last 3 to 4 years beauty industry has grown immensely. There  new and various ways ways of making women feel beautiful.The lost is endless ranging from wigs, braids, eyeshadow pallets, lip glosses, lashes, concealers i could go on an on not forgetting the numerous ways one can have their nails done.

 The beauty Industry has been fast growing cause everwhere you turn the nearest saloon is only a step away. I can not begin to mention the number of Avon agents I know personally as friends and family. There are various options to chose from including the new Fenti shop I am yet to check out. 

The strength of these business is that more youths are being trained for beauty courses at Community innovation hubs so the beauty salons always have enough manpower to handle any number of customers. It is very accessible to anyone who is interested as the government has had a huge hand to play in financing such enterprises which could also be its biggest weakness as these funds are limited and will depend on the owner in order for the business to grow making it its biggest weakness apart from the fact that there is competition everywhrre and the likeness of these business to expand is slim to none but yet still very dominant.
 Opportunities have risen from the numbers of youths inspired to do the same.This ensures that the business is still very much leaning into our future and provides security to the business owners.

 The business are in aim of supporting each other but is most commonly viewed as a threat because of the overwhelming competition around making them malfunctional as they would bearly live up to their margings in terms of profit. This is because each salon will have to prove itself and this means more money will be spent on advertisements. In the end all is fair in this industry and in my point would be the fastest growing industry in Zimbabw

Can you please answer this for me in a detailed manner , I would love to know that!

Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.

How was your church festival?
25/07/22, 22:41 - Unknown: Also, before we start our session.
First of all, the newsletter for today is very interesting and impressive.
There are 2 questions in it, you must answer them now.
 I am waiting for your answer and then I will share my understanding \/ opinion about them.
25/07/22, 22:44 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: It was great
25/07/22, 22:44 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: Okay
25/07/22, 22:45 - Unknown: Check the questions Ashleigh!
25/07/22, 23:02 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: I have just finished reading the pdf. 
I would need time to carefully articulate my responses to both questions 
I am working on it now
25/07/22, 23:34 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: 1. For Edoofa to reach greater heights as a community it need to have people. This  has been my most enjoyed project yet. I believe that the community has to grow in order to glow and speaking numbers, the more people to join Edoofa the greater its height. The pressure is now there on maintaining this standard of not only having Edoofa as a community with many people, but that with morals and beliefs that inspire nations at large. 

2. A sense of oneness is the most crucial part of a successful community because through individuality comes new ideas and innovations. As a student leader being more open to the idea that everyone is different is the first step. Then comes being transparent and motivating the different ideas of every individual
26/07/22, 00:21 - Unknown: Great Ashleigh,
I would like to add to your understanding.
Actions that are based on the principles of Oneness are rewarding in the sense that they fill us with happiness and joy, whether or not you get your desired results. Just the act of committing to the effort makes us feel connected to everything and can help heal isolation, loneliness, and helplessness.
26/07/22, 00:26 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: I agree
26/07/22, 00:27 - Unknown: Hence in edoofa you can show your commitment and efforts by working on the projects we have, also *as a mentor I understand that projects have a dependency on others for example if some school head is responding or not, whether a company is interested or not etc but for activities and lessons you should keep the focus on top to shine in the community*
26/07/22, 00:28 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: Yes ma'am
26/07/22, 00:34 - Unknown: Being your mentor as we grow in this relationship I am trying to understand your obstacles\/issues and on the same lines I expect that you also make consistent efforts by ensuring *A1 attendance* in sessions so that you prove to be one of my best students!
26/07/22, 00:37 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: I'm making my best efforts to attend online sessions. There are challenges this side of loadshedding and network and sometimes other immediate commitments tie me down 
But im finding my balance
26/07/22, 15:07 - Ashleigh EWYL22E0134: Good morning ma'am I am a proud Edoofian
