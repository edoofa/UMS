10/11/22, 22:35 - Praise EWYL22E0567: good afternoon
15/11/22, 17:47 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr

19/11/22, 21:33 - Unknown: Good day edoofian ,
Hope everything is well at your end!
I would like to share a brief message about the importance of planning in our lives and as an organization as well!
Planning is definitely significant as it directs us where to go, it furnishes direction and decreases the danger of risk by making predictions. The significant advantages of planning are provided below:
Planning provides directions: Planning assures that the objectives are certainly asserted so that they serve as a model for determining what action should be taken and in which direction. If objects are well established, employees are informed of what the company has to do and what they need do to accomplish those purposes.
Planning decreases the chances of risk: Planning is an activity which permits a manager to look forward and predict changes. By determining in prior the tasks to be completed, planning notes the way to deal with changes and unpredictable effects.
Planning decreases overlapping and wasteful activities: Planning works as the foundation of organising the activities and purposes of distinct branches, departments, and people. It assists in avoiding chaos and confusion. Since planning guarantees precision in understanding and action, work is conducted on easily without delays.
19/11/22, 22:37 - Praise EWYL22E0567: Understood
20/11/22, 19:31 - Unknown: Greetings Praise,
Now, please let me know what did you understand from the above text and how should we execute the same?
Which EWYL project are you currently working on and how will you use the planning function  in that?
13/12/22, 19:10 - Unknown: True, we must always accept the challenges and be upfront for fighting with them.
A never give up attitude would make a person successful and god helps the one who helps themselves.
13/12/22, 20:34 - Praise EWYL22E0567: Thats true
14/12/22, 19:23 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian,

16/12/22, 20:24 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Let us start your session.
I have a simple riddle for you to start with:
You can see it every day, but you cannot touch it. What is it?

17/12/22, 00:32 - Unknown: Effective and timely feedback is a crucial part of a successful performance, as I discussed with you in our Saturday activity.I wanted to get in touch with you to share your EWYL report card and ask you to evaluate your performance by responding to the following questions:
1. How would you rate your performance from 1-10, 10 being the highest score?
2. What is your goal- in terms of skills and amount of scholarship credits that you want to earn?
3. What is your plan- how will you achieve the above mentioned goal?
The answers you give here will be evaluated by Ms Deepali and Ms Davi. So take you time and share your responses here in the group itself before our session.

17/12/22, 18:50 - Unknown: Good day my proud edoofian!
Let us continue our discussion for the day!

Also, you will be getting your Saturday activity today!
17/12/22, 18:51 - Unknown: I will help you with some tips:
1. Have a plan
Set goals at the beginning of the project and note the date. Have a deadline for it as well, it is good to manage the goals. Decide at the beginning how often you are going to work on the project.

2. Listen and listen
Listening in my opinion is more important than saying anything. Listen to the other person's problems and just by being there you might help the other person to think out loud and share their thoughts with you [ in reference to school headmasters and other students ].
17/12/22, 22:46 - Praise EWYL22E0567: Okay
