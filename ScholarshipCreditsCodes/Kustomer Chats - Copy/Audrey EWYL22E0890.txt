21/09/23, 16:46 - Audrey EWYL22E0890: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Audrey Bvekwa and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is EWYL22E0890
21/09/23, 16:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Audrey!
How are you?
21/09/23, 16:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Before we begin, as we have come on the EWYL Line, you have already completed some basic formalities. Now, I would want that we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.

I kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let me know.
21/09/23, 17:35 - Audrey EWYL22E0890: I'm okay how are you
21/09/23, 17:36 - Audrey EWYL22E0890: We can continue with the program
22/09/23, 14:35 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
How are you doing?

Before beginning with the session may I know if I am currently in touch with Audrey or parent to Audrey?
22/09/23, 17:14 - Audrey EWYL22E0890: You're with Audrey
