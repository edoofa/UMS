24/11/23, 15:14 - Kudzi EWYL23E0850: Indeed the power of competitive spirit is a catalyst for growth and success, I've learned that a competitive spirit is made up of various things such as *The competitive Edge* where a competitive spirit instills a drive  to excel, pushing individuals and organisations to continually improve and innovate, and through having positive mind to outperform, it creates a culture of excellence that permeates every aspect of one's work.

Moreso, through fostering innovations, competition breeds innovations, as a desire to stay ahead compels individuals and organisations to think outside the box like Elon Musk the owner of Tesla company is a good example we can mention who introduced electric vehicles with cutting edge technology.

In addition, Economic growth of a country shows how competitive the country is, on a macroeconomic level, nations that embrace a competitive spirit like China experience a sustained growth and development. China transformed itself from a primarily agrarian society into the world's second largest economy, and lastly when ever someone has a competitive spirit, you should be able to overcome challenges because a competitive spirit equips individuals and organisations with the resilience to overcome challenges.

"Your present circumstances don't determine where you can go; they merely determine where you start." - Nido Qubein
This profound quote encourages us to see our current situation as a starting point, not a limitation. It emphasizes the limitless potential for growth, learning, and transformation, regardless of our current circumstances.
Before we delve into our session's agenda, I'd love to hear how you're doing. Your well-being is important, and I'm here to support you on your journey.
01/12/23, 13:12 - Unknown: I understand the frustration of receiving messages late. Let's  troubleshoot this together. First, try restarting your phone to ensure  it's not a temporary glitch. Check if your phone has the latest software  updates, as outdated software can sometimes cause communication issues.  Additionally, verify your network connection and consider switching  between Wi-Fi and mobile data to see if there's any improvement.

05/12/23, 12:34 - Kudzi EWYL23E0850: My progress on Community building project was awesome, though I encountered some challenges, I could not manage to get in touch with the schools around my homestead because they were having their end of year exam, and also some of the parents were very tough due to previous incidents they encountered, though to some  I managed to settle with them and having clear discussion, and so far I have about 20 students and I have grouped them  each group containing 5 students. The reason behind this idea of grouping students was inorder to have a clear discussion, a question and answer session so that everyone gets equiped with the correct knowledge, and as for my next project I'd like to improve my communication skills and to be brave enough and  also try to work extra harder inorder to attain best results, thank you.

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental.

We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

19/12/23, 13:54 - Unknown: Good Morning Kudzi

I hope you are doing well
'Tis the season of joy and inspiration! 🎄✨ As we kick off our session, let's unwrap the motivation that Christmas brings – a time of giving, warmth, and endless possibilities.
Here's a festive riddle to spark curiosity: What do you get if you cross a snowman and a vampire?
Excited to reveal the answer and dive into our discussion!
19/12/23, 13:54 - Unknown: I am doing good, thank you so much for asking.
19/12/23, 14:05 - Unknown: Thank you for sharing the student application form, I have taken a note of the same.

19/12/23, 14:13 - Unknown: The answer to the festive riddle, "What do you get if you cross a snowman and a vampire?" is "Frostbite!" 🧛‍♂️❄️
So, when you combine the chilly aura of a snowman with the fang-tastic presence of a vampire, you get the playfully frosty term "Frostbite." It's a fun twist that blends the elements of winter and a bit of cheeky vampire humor. Hope this brings a smile to your face! 😄🎄
