13/07/22, 02:43 - Saloni Rastogi: Good Nontokozo, however, let me share the activity that you had to work on this week.
13/07/22, 02:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my proud Edoofians hope you are doing well. \u2028\u2028You must have learned how critical it is to take advantage of every opportunity. In our Wednesday Wisdom this week, we discussed a profitable business- Skooqs. Do you know that Skooqs was developed in just five days!! Thanks to Oluwadamilola Soyombo's (Founder of Skooqs), diligence and use of the opportunity. The use of the opportunity at the right time with the right skills is currently creating a significant impact on the African entrepreneurial ecosystem.  And well some of you, because of your consistency, diligence, willingness to show up for your sessions, and performance in your weekly activities have gotten this opportunity to work on a project with Skooqs.
13/07/22, 02:44 - Saloni Rastogi: You are probably aware of the possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. This week, I want you to think of a few skills or practices that a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits. 
Please list the skills that are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring in a lot of learning.

You are required to share your response in 150 to 200 words over the dedicated EWYL line by Monday 9 AM.
13/07/22, 02:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, I have an exciting video for you to go through, I sure was overwhelmed to see the love all of you shared. As I shared that the founders of the Edoofa program Mr. Angad and Mr. Avreen were traveling across Africa the whole of last month, I have some exciting highlights to share with you from the same. So, please watch the following video of the same and we will discuss it in our next session.

14/07/22, 03:28 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: Yes i did its this one
14/07/22, 03:40 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: Today' s lesson was interesting as i got to understand that one can be successful only if he or she believes in his\/herself.
Despite the background one needs to believe that what he whats he will get.

Just like Pantice Mostepe it is never too late to rise. I also wish that someday i could be like him.
14/07/22, 21:44 - Saloni Rastogi: \"Success is Not Final, Failure is Not Fatal: it is the Courage to Continue that Counts\"- Winston Churchill 

Greeting of the day my proud Edoofian! How are you doing?
14/07/22, 21:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Amazing work on the Lesson task. I saw that Patrice had the wisdom to recognize and grab the opportunities that time brought for him and that is what set him apart from others and made him who he is.

Do you agree on this Edoofian?
14/07/22, 22:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Please respond to the message Nontokozo.
15/07/22, 00:02 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: Yes i do

15/07/22, 00:25 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: Yes i agree
15/07/22, 01:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Now recognizing and grabbing the opportunities that come at hand is crucial. Do you believe you do that as well?

15/07/22, 01:49 - Saloni Rastogi: So, do you believe you are able to utilize the opportunity that the EWYL program creates for you? Are you able to fully leverage your opportunity to self fund your higher education?

20/07/22, 02:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Did you work on the  very interesting Weekend activity? 

I personally enjoyed learning about SWOT analysis and implementing it for my self. I hope you did too.
20/07/22, 02:42 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: I did not get the weekend activity my whatsapp expired.
20/07/22, 17:09 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: I am a Proud Edoofian
20/07/22, 17:10 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
20/07/22, 17:12 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: Thank you very much for such a title
20/07/22, 21:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Nontokozo, let me share thew activity again with you, please work on it and share the response here now.
20/07/22, 21:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Its that time of the week, when you are required to wear your thinking caps and get your tools ready to research and learn! From our Wednesday Wisdom, we learnt how Patrice Motsepe, became successful by making the best of the opportunity very few could see, the strong potential in the mining industry. As part of your Saturday Activity you are required to share a detailed submission on the fast growing industry\/sector\/business in your country. Don’t forget to add a SWOT analysis and the predictions on the future performance of the same.

Word limit- 250-500 words. \u2028Use of internet is allowed but do not copy the entire submission from internet. You have to write it in your own words.
21/07/22, 19:48 - Saloni Rastogi: \"Challenges are what make life interesting. Overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.”  Marine

Greeting of the day, my proud Edoofian! How are you doing?
21/07/22, 19:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share your response in the text here Nontokozo?
21/07/22, 23:55 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: Am a Proud Edoofian
21/07/22, 23:55 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: The fastest growing sector in Zimbabwe is the mining sector. Zimbabwe is rich in many minerals i.e. gold, diamond, tin, copper, platinum and other metallic and nonmetallic ores. The mining sector also contributes about 16% of GDP.  Mining industry has high values and bestowed with significant mineral resources available on the earth to go for. However, its overbearingly negative environmental impacts outweigh the socioeconomic benefits. Air pollution, water pollution and land degradation are common in areas where such mining is carried out. Mined materials are needed to construct roads and hospitals, to build automobiles and houses, to make computers and satellites, to generate electricity, and to provide the many other goods and services that consumers enjoy. In addition, mining is economically important to producing regions and countries. In a world of deeper mines, more complex ore bodies, rising energy costs, social and geopolitical risks, infrastructure shortages and resource nationalism, mining companies remain under exceptional pressure to control costs, heighten efficiency and improve safety performance.
21/07/22, 23:57 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation.

23/07/22, 00:07 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: My takeaway is that one should not blame other people for his failure but rather take every mistake as a lesson to achieve anything.
23/07/22, 01:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Good to read your response on this lesson Nontokozo! I am glad that you were able to understand the crux of that which is that successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it.

24/07/22, 22:54 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: GROWTH MINDSET OF SUCCESSFULL PEOPLE

People who possess growth mindsets are more likely to be successful. 
In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work-brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.
Successful people have a growth mindset and they're happy to keep trying until they get what they want. They're willing to try all kinds of strategies and techniques because they know they'll eventually get them where they want to go And they're right. 
The growth mindset stimulates one's drive, willingness, and overall foundation of belief to achieve bigger and better outcomes. 
   Having a growth mindset is also important because it can help you overcome obstacles you may face when learning something new or developing a new skill. Growth mindsets understand the importance of persistence and determination. By changing the way you think, you can change the way you learn.

To make sure i have the same mindset i believe i should tell my self that am successful and believe in my self that 1 day i would climb the ladder of success with the same mindset.

25/07/22, 03:18 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

19/01/23, 18:17 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
19/01/23, 18:18 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing good, thank you.
19/01/23, 18:18 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: That's good to know
19/01/23, 18:19 - Saloni Rastogi: I know we have both been connected in the EWYL Journey for a long time now and I very well know how dedicatedly and consistently you work and make every session's discussion very productive and interactive. 
This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday. 

1) Your sessions will be held on the *EWYL Line.*
2) In a session, we discuss:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Along with this, I would like to inform you that the _purpose of EWYL Group is for tracking your progress and important notifications, not for response submissions._
4) *Every day you must come on the EWYL Line and follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'*.?️
5) In cases where you are not able to attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
19/01/23, 18:19 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: Okay
19/01/23, 18:22 - Saloni Rastogi: I am sharing this week's Wednesday lesson with you. I hope you have a look at it and share your views on it.
19/01/23, 18:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian!

Hope you are doing well.  Time for our Wednesday wisdom, let us dive deep into the art of asking good questions. While listening is an important skill, the art of asking questions is equally, if not more, important when it comes to learning more about your work tasks, unlocking hidden opportunities, delivering better results, and mitigating unforeseen risks. Read the PDF carefully and share your learnings with me in our upcoming session. 

Happy learning!
19/01/23, 18:23 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: Thanks
02/02/23, 05:02 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: Good day

How are you?
02/02/23, 17:09 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for the late reply. By the time you texted, it was quite late in India. Let me highlight the time difference here in India, it is 03:30 hours. My working hours are:
07:30 AM-04:30 PM Zimbabwean Time I Monday-Friday
07:30 AM-01:30 PM Zimbabwean Time I Saturday
The organization remains closed on Sundays.
02/02/23, 17:09 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: Am good and you
02/02/23, 17:10 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing good, thank you.
02/02/23, 17:10 - Saloni Rastogi: I would like to congratulate you for clearing all your A-Level subjects and getting these good grades, surely your hard work paid off. 

I'm sure the family must also be very proud of your efforts and the results. 

I would encourage you to share these results in your admission group as well so that your admissions officer can connect with you to discuss the next step in your admission process. 

Please be patient and I would like to share that the only mode of communication should be sending your result slips on your admissions group, texting your Admission officer personally might delay your conversation.
02/02/23, 17:10 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: Okay we will meet then
02/02/23, 17:11 - Nontokozo EWYL22E0324: Okay thanks
