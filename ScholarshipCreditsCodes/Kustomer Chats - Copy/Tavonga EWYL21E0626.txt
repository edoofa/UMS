12/07/22, 18:56 - Tavonga EWYL21E0626: SKILLS THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR SOMEONE TO GET PROJECTS THAT ARE CHALLENGING:
1.Social media literacy - as most companies are now technologically driven nowadays, there is need for students to acquire and master how to use social media platforms like Instagram to facilitate business activities.

2.Communication Skills - I think in order to get more challenging tasks, a student should have   good communication skills that will enable him\/ her to be able to communicate effectively with other people which will aid in prosperity of the projects.

3.Decision making - I think decision making is so important as it is the knack of making the right moves at the right time.This will enable a student to be able to tackle difficult projects like these.

4. Dedication - I think students should also have full dedication in order to be able to take on and complete these projects.The desire and passion to work hard will always give someone that extra push and confidence to succeed.

How are you?
14/07/22, 02:13 - Saloni Rastogi: I am really glad to hear your understanding of the activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY* . They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost up, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.
14/07/22, 02:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Also I am very happy to see your dedication to following the daily ritual of 'I am proud edoofian'.

14/07/22, 19:28 - Tavonga EWYL21E0626: Yesterday's Wednesday lesson was about Patrice Motsepe who went on to make billions of dollars despite his father being a teacher once.Through his father's small store where mine workers came to buy liquor, Patrice got his first exposure to the mining business.He then met several mining organisations while he was a visiting attorney to McGuire Woods law firm in 1991,3 years after getting his LLB in 1988.He was very enthused and attracted by the business.This exposure sparked Patrice's  determination and he started to read books,articles and he did almost,if not everything he could so that he could get a full understanding about the mining business.Patrice was then appointed as Bowman Gilfillan law firm's first black partner in 1994.He then started to specialise in mining and business law and his exposure to the firm helped him to start his his own mining firm by the name Future Mining.He also went on to establish the African Rainbow Minerals and acquired Anglo Gold's mine shafts with the help of Bobby Godsell who was now the Chief Executive Officer of Anglo's gold and uranium department.After succeeding in turning the mining business around,he then partnered with Anglo Platinum,the world's largest platinum producer.He also partnered with South Africa's gold producer called Harmony.By 2017,Patrice had amassed a net worth of about $1.6 billion.From Patrice's story, l learnt that hard work and determination can lead a person to achieve all the set targets in his\/ her life.l also learnt that you have to take some risks along the way in order to succeed as Patrice risked acquiring the mine shafts and he also had his requests for loans from banks rejected but he never gave up and that is why never giving up is another lesson l also learnt.

Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a way. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. With can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard.

The digital gaming sector has really climbed the ladder over the last few years in Zimbabwe.Many businesspeople have found a way of attracting a lot of young people and grown ups as well by establishing cafes and halls that are specifically for gaming.Popular games like Fifa, San Andres,PES and Need For Speed are played for a certain charge per hour and this makes the business so successful (profitable) as many youngings are interested in these digital games.This also makes it esy to identify target markets.TNT in Mutare,Zimbabwe is a good example of how the sector is succeeding and gaining popularity among the people especially the youths as people flood the palace everyday with only one purpose,to get their hands on the play stations and play games.Queues are seen outside TNT and this was a sign of how profitable the business really is and many gaming centres like Zee Games were established in Mutare leading to the growth of the sector.

21/07/22, 20:46 - Tavonga EWYL21E0626: Yesterday's Wednesday Lesson was about mastering the right attitude.I learnt that failure is often caused by putting blame on others instead of just accepting personal responsiblity.When people choose to blame,it only serves as a reason to give up and stop trying in challenging situations.Conversely, successful people do not cat blame but instead they accept personal responsibility,learn from their mistakes and rise up to the challenge in order to achieve success.In this lesson,I've learnt to not blame others for my failure as losers do but to accept responsibility,learn from my mistakes, to always have the right attitude and to mind how I approach and talk to other people.

How are you doing today?
21/07/22, 22:48 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your response Tavonga and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
21/07/22, 22:49 - Saloni Rastogi: So in today's session, we will:
