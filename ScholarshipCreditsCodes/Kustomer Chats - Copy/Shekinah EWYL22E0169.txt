12/07/22, 16:34 - Jasmine Kaur: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

21/07/22, 19:18 - Shekinah EWYL22E0169: Key concepts I learnt from today’s lesson is that as an individual I should always bear in mind that success is not an overnight thing, it takes time, patience, learning from our mistakes and perseverance
21/07/22, 21:14 - Jasmine Kaur: Let us talk about your Wednesday lesson now,
It actually taught me a lesson that *Blaming others does not yield any fruitful outcome.*
21/07/22, 22:37 - Shekinah EWYL22E0169: Yes that’s very true, you’ll never reach your full potential too because you don’t take time to do self introspection
21/07/22, 22:49 - Jasmine Kaur: Can you please give me a detailed understanding Shekinah?
22/07/22, 02:11 - Shekinah EWYL22E0169: When you develop a culture of blaming others you lose self confidence . For example if you had a group project you won’t contribute because you’re afraid that if the project fails you’re going to be blamed. In other words you now believe that everyone is like you who blames others. 
But if you develop a culture of taking the blame to yourself you’re going to put your best efforts towards every task you’re given and if you happen to fail that task you won’t give up because you understand that failure is part of success
22/07/22, 17:36 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings my proud edoofian,

25/07/22, 03:17 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
