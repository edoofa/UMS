03/02/23, 01:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Tinotenda!
How are you?
03/02/23, 01:20 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
03/02/23, 01:20 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
03/02/23, 01:21 - Saloni Rastogi: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
03/02/23, 01:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
03/02/23, 01:31 - Tinotenda EWYL22E1096: Yes I'm very ready

With this, have a great day and please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'.
03/02/23, 01:36 - Tinotenda EWYL22E1096: Noted !
03/02/23, 01:37 - Tinotenda EWYL22E1096: Can l ask if there is a specific time l need to send the message
03/02/23, 20:25 - Tinotenda EWYL22E1096: *I am a proud Edoofian*
03/02/23, 20:26 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily
03/02/23, 23:53 - Tinotenda EWYL22E1096: OK, Noted .
04/02/23, 00:20 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Tinotenda!
How are you?
04/02/23, 00:21 - Saloni Rastogi: For the daily ritual, you have to do that everyday.
04/02/23, 00:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
04/02/23, 00:22 - Tinotenda EWYL22E1096: I'm great , How are you too
04/02/23, 00:22 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing good, thank you.
04/02/23, 00:22 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
04/02/23, 00:23 - Tinotenda EWYL22E1096: I'm great , How are you too
04/02/23, 00:23 - Tinotenda EWYL22E1096: OK . Thank you very much
04/02/23, 00:28 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing good, thank you.
04/02/23, 01:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, by the time we connect tomorrow, may I know which project which project will you be working on in the month of February?
04/02/23, 01:10 - Tinotenda EWYL22E1096: I will be doing Corporate Alliances
04/02/23, 01:10 - Tinotenda EWYL22E1096: At what time are we connecting tomorrow
04/02/23, 21:05 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Tinotenda!

04/02/23, 21:05 - Saloni Rastogi: I am glad to hear that you are opting for the corporate alliances project.
04/02/23, 21:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you listen to this, share your concerns with me.

04/02/23, 23:08 - Tinotenda EWYL22E1096: *I am a Proud Edoofian*
04/02/23, 23:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily
04/02/23, 23:35 - Tinotenda EWYL22E1096: Understood , everything is quite clear
05/02/23, 15:49 - Tinotenda EWYL22E1096: *I am a Proud Edoofian*

06/02/23, 14:56 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian, Let me share a small story with you!                                                                                                                                                                                       Ready??                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

How are you?
I am happy to see the updates that you have shared with me. This week and our upcoming weeks are all about achieving our targets for the projects. Some students achieved it, and some are still working. I want that you take a moment to realize that only if you *work on the project--->*then only you will earn credits--->then only you will be able to financially assist yourself and your family while paying your college fees*.
We have to think big, and work really hard.

Let's connect in your scheduled session next, till then:
1) Follow the daily ritual
2) Share your pending lessons+weekend activity understanding
3) Projects Update

06/03/23, 15:50 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

How are you?

In today's session, we will discuss:
1) Weekend activity
2) Projects
06/03/23, 21:25 - Saloni Rastogi: I completely agree with you on Wednesday lesson understandingand I believe experiences make us feel alive: there are times when we live our lives and slowly let them pass us by. This can happen when you stick to the same routine day and night without doing anything new. Going through life in the same 'state' can be tedious, but an unforgettable experience will awaken your mind and soul.
