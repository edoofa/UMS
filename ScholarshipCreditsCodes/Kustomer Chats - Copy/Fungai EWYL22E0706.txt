15/11/22, 21:02 - Fungai EWYL22E0706: Thank you so much
16/11/22, 00:20 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings of the day!
How are you?
16/11/22, 00:21 - Jasmine Kaur: May I please know your EWYL Group and mentor name?
16/11/22, 00:30 - Fungai EWYL22E0706: Fungai EWYL22E0706 group name

16/11/22, 03:53 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr

17/11/22, 17:38 - Fungai EWYL22E0706: I am  a proud edoofian
17/11/22, 17:39 - Jasmine Kaur: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

19/11/22, 22:36 - Jasmine Kaur: Good day edoofian ,
Hope everything is well at your end!
I would like to share a brief message about the importance of planning in our lives and as an organization as well!
Planning is definitely significant as it directs us where to go, it furnishes direction and decreases the danger of risk by making predictions. The significant advantages of planning are provided below:
Planning provides directions: Planning assures that the objectives are certainly asserted so that they serve as a model for determining what action should be taken and in which direction. If objects are well established, employees are informed of what the company has to do and what they need do to accomplish those purposes.
Planning decreases the chances of risk: Planning is an activity which permits a manager to look forward and predict changes. By determining in prior the tasks to be completed, planning notes the way to deal with changes and unpredictable effects.
Planning decreases overlapping and wasteful activities: Planning works as the foundation of organising the activities and purposes of distinct branches, departments, and people. It assists in avoiding chaos and confusion. Since planning guarantees precision in understanding and action, work is conducted on easily without delays.
19/11/22, 22:57 - Fungai EWYL22E0706: Yes I understand
20/11/22, 19:13 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings Fungai,
Now, please let me know what did you understand from the above text and how should we execute the same?

During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages. Let us get a better understanding of the three stages!

14/12/22, 21:25 - Jasmine Kaur: Use the text given below:
14/12/22, 21:25 - Jasmine Kaur: What is Edoofa Program:

Make sure your applicants know what is Edoofa Program all about, brief introduction to Edoofa should be shared by you to the applicant so that the applicant can have clarity while filling out the form. 

(Logic:- You tend to ask the applicants just to fill out the application form, but when the applicant asks about the program you share that the counselor will brief them about the same. Due to this, students who might be looking for a scholarship in their home country also tend to apply. You should share about the Edoofa Program and brief the applicant on a few key details so that the counselor can cross-question them during counseling.) 

The following text can be edited and used by the you to ensure every Student is aware of the program Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 5 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 3000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains! Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. They are associated with more than 90 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Their associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated

Edoofian, at Edoofa each one of us believes in nurturing the best In order to achieve the best. I know you have the same goal and I am sure about other people joining us along with you. But I personally feel that ‘just’ getting the right course should not be our sole aim. I, as your mentor, am very much amazed by your activities and sessions’ interactions and I feel you have the potential to do more wonders. So along with aiming for your course, you can gift yourself some added benefits and I know you are very well aware about how to achieve it, that is through projects.


So quickly, give me updates on community building and  school connect projects as I have to give a weekly report at the end of this week to Ms.Deepali.

24/12/22, 00:56 - Jasmine Kaur: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
24/12/22, 00:56 - Fungai EWYL22E0706: Good day to you
24/12/22, 18:37 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings Proud Edoofians,

The holiday season is upon us and it’s time to light up the Christmas trees and indulge ourselves in the festivities. I assume due to the Christmas and New year seasons everyone is in a buoyant mood?

 Well, then I implore you to avail this time to spend with your family and friends. We are announcing holidays from tomorrow, 24th December 2022 to till 1st January 2023. You are required to report on 2nd January 2023.
Go out with friends to parties, eat with no concern, go to a church or set up Christmas at your home. Have a Christmas and New Year of your desire. Then come back with much more energy as your EWYL team has planned a very fruitful year ahead of you.

Many more projects, more skills to master, more exposure to new companies, more knowledge, and more surprises.

 Are you excited? Well, let the passion in you burn as we are waiting for you to come back stronger. Let’s make a new resolution to new ventures with discoveries that are waiting to happen.

 Happy Holidays,

26/12/22, 19:46 - Jasmine Kaur: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
I hope you had fun on Christmas and you got a lot of presents but in my opinion people who give actual presents are gifts for us!

11/01/23, 01:43 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings my proud edoofian,
I am apologetic for the delayed response; I was spending quality time with my family!
I asked you to report on 2nd January but, because I was not in town I could not reply in time.

I hope you enjoyed New Year,
I am really excited to know what you did on the NYE!!

I went for a staycation with my family at one of the very beautiful properties in Chandigarh ( a city ).
*Let’s exchange our experience and then we will start with our learnings and curriculum.*
