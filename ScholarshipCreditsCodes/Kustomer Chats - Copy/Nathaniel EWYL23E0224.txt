02/08/23, 17:34 - Nathaniel EWYL23E0224: Ok
02/08/23, 17:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Nathaniel!
How are you?
02/08/23, 17:49 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
02/08/23, 17:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - “I am a proud Edoofian”
02/08/23, 17:50 - Saloni Rastogi: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
02/08/23, 17:50 - Nathaniel EWYL23E0224: Im fine mam
02/08/23, 17:51 - Saloni Rastogi: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
02/08/23, 17:53 - Nathaniel EWYL23E0224: Ok mam lm with you mam

03/08/23, 13:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Good morning!
How are you doing?

In our session today we will discuss how adaptability can be mind-boggling and how necessary it is for all of us>

So in our session please share your *views on the same* and *updates on the projects.*
03/08/23, 13:21 - Nathaniel EWYL23E0224: Ok
03/08/23, 13:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share what all you understood about adaptability?
03/08/23, 14:13 - Nathaniel EWYL23E0224: Mam currently on the closing speeche but l will definitely answer that on 12:00
03/08/23, 14:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Sure Nathaniel, you can do that.
03/08/23, 16:32 - Nathaniel EWYL23E0224: Adoptability is the ability to adjust to new circumstances, environments and culture. It is an essential skill that fosters resilience, open mindedness and sympathy.

Therefore for to be adoptable lhave to cultivate my mind.
The following are saome of the points that need to be considered for Adoptability
1) before my trips , l have to invest time in researching Indian customs and traditions. For example religion, cuisine, festivals and more . Alsaso learning some crutial phrases of the language as greetings
2)Developing empathy and respect where empathy is the ability to share feelings with others and to understand them 
3) adopting in social norms as lndia have diverse culture and it is essential to observe them . Respect personal space and avoid sensitive talks like politics
Embracing lndian cuisine, food is an integral part of Indian culture and exploring different food cuisine may be a delightful experience. Be willing to try dishes even if they seem to be unfamiliar to me 

5) handling culture shocks , it is natural to experience culture shocks when stepping into new  environment. Acknowledging my feelings is better knowing that is jusst a temporary adjustment therefore it is good to mantain possative mindset and seek support from fellow travellers and locals 

I *think this is the summary concerning adoptability*

Hope you are well.

Through this lesson, I learned that Video blogging, or vlogging, has transformed how we share stories and insights. With just a camera and a creative mind, individuals can transport audiences into their world, adding a visual and personal touch to their narratives. Vlogging blends entertainment, education, and authenticity, allowing creators to connect with viewers on a deeper level. From travel escapades to cooking tutorials, vlogging's dynamic nature captures attention, fostering a sense of community and fostering a global conversation through the power of visual storytelling.

In this session, I want to learn what all you grasped about **VIDEO BLOGGING** and yes, **PROJECT UPDATES**
10/08/23, 13:25 - Nathaniel EWYL23E0224: Greetings mam.... We can proceed with our session

10/08/23, 14:18 - Nathaniel EWYL23E0224: Furthermore
10/08/23, 14:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Absolutely, you've grasped the essence of vlogging! It's wonderful to see your enthusiasm for exploring creative avenues and potentially turning your passion into a profitable venture. By sharing your experiences through short videos, you're not only expressing yourself but also connecting with a global audience. Keep in mind that successful vlogging requires consistency, authenticity, and a deep understanding of your target audience. Engage with your viewers, respond to their feedback, and continually refine your content.
10/08/23, 14:34 - Nathaniel EWYL23E0224: There are some steps which are taken which are in summary:
1choosing my niche.  
I have to choose a theme in which l have to use For example it can be of traveling or of beauty

2) Planning my content: outlining the ideas on the content even the use of a calender where you can plan your events
