It was a great learning experience for me as well.


Below mentioned are my personal notes from the session yesterday


Lack of Industry Ready Youth
-Nowadays, Our Youth has the required degrees but no application of knowledge.
-Yasmin here highlighted the importance of the EWYL Program where edoofians are getting a chance to apply the knowledge through various projects and are also earning side by side.


Importance of Work Experience 
-Carrying forward the point, She explained the importance of work experience. The Earlier you get involved, The better. 

Strive to be a great communicator
-Emphasised being progressive. 
-Highlighted the importance of a united Africa
-The video shared above is one of the best bits from the Webinar

Global Exposure
-Global Exposure is the KEY. The more exposure, The more valuable you become.

Be a Problem Solver
-Employer wants solution-orientated people.
-Every challenge should be seen as an opportunity to innovate, be creative, and develop something.

Be an excellent Time Manager

Embrace Long Life Learning
-Learning never stops. It is a continuous process.
-The more skills you acquire, the more valuable you become
-Youtube: Best University to acquire knowledge for FREE

Commitment
-Show the hunger to learn. Don’t complain, Always be ready to do it.

Be Nice
-What you don’t do in the daylight, Don’t do in the dark
-Believe in Integrity and Trust

Know the Industry, Know the Brand
-Research before you approach
01/10/22, 17:22 - Asher EWYL22E0064: Thank you very much,sir. It was a golden opportunity to be part of the webinar. 

To add on , she also discussed about being financial literacy at the young age , time management and to apply the knowledge we learn from the EWYL.
01/10/22, 17:22 - Asher EWYL22E0064: I am fine , thank you for asking. I hope you are also fine.
01/10/22, 17:23 - Asher EWYL22E0064: Did Nigel reached you yesterday? I reminded him again.

02/10/22, 23:09 - Asher EWYL22E0064: Greetings, sir. I have opened the images. 

They are emphasizing on not taking short cuts in life.The main disadvantage of shortcuts is that they create risk. You first have the risk of never being able to come back in track. By stopping the original task and starting another one to reach the same goal, you may spread yourself too thin and lose track of where you are and how far you've gone.So the images you have sent are telling me to work *harder* so that l will be financially stable.

10/10/22, 19:05 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!
11/10/22, 00:42 - Unknown: Asher, I hope that you have gone through the activity given above?
11/10/22, 00:50 - Unknown: Asher, I must say that you truly are a inspiration to all those students who wants to study abroad and steer ahead towards a successful career. I wanted to inform you that our counselors happened to have a conversation with your school and they both agreed that a student like you can motivate your juniors who are studying at your school.
That is why, I gave them an idea that I previously shared with one of our students Hazel. She made a video which was later shown in her school back in Africa. I want you to create a similar video like that so that it can be used as a sense of motivation to your juniors.
11/10/22, 00:51 - Unknown: I am sharing the sample video in your EWYL Group.
Please have a look at that and feel free to ask any doubts.

Our aim of this activity is to nurture and highlights the skills that are necessary for your career development and also for your enhanced performance in the EWYL Projects.
13/07/22, 05:56 - Asher EWYL22E0064: *Saturday activity* 

 *Skills for challenging projects* 

You need a variety of both hard and soft skills to be a successful project manager.

The soft skills are those you can develop through any education or work experience, and they help you shape the right temperament for project management. The hard skills are those you need to learn specifically for this role, and you can learn them through formal project management training or on the job as a project manager . 

Good communication is one of the soft skills. You should feel confident interpreting the needs of one group or department and explaining them to another.You’ll likely also mediate conflicts among stakeholders and handle negotiations about time, cost and scope. You have to be able to understand everyone’s role and perspective while diplomatically communicating them across the project.

Project managers should be masters of written, verbal and visual communication. 

Key for any management role, critical thinking will come into play daily in project management. You have to be able to make quick decisions within a set of constraints, foreseeing the potential implications for the future of a project.

Critical thinking in project management supports your ability to analyze the data and information you’re given to make decisions in the planning stage then carry that knowledge throughout the project as conditions change. It helps you make calls as needed to negotiate constraints and hold stakeholders
 accountable.

Time management is also important . You should be able to work under pressure since you will be given may task so you have to create your own timetable.
13/07/22, 16:50 - Unknown: Good Morning, Asher ?
I hope that you are good health and spirits
13/07/22, 16:50 - Unknown: Asher, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.
This way you will always be recognized by the Academics Board for new projects.

15/07/22, 17:41 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
15/07/22, 17:42 - Asher EWYL22E0064: Thank you very much,sir.
15/07/22, 18:12 - Unknown: Good Morning, Proud Edoofian
I hope that you are in good health and spirits.

While going through our conversation, I noticed that you haven't submitted *Wednesday's Lesson* yet.
The deadline to make the submission is *Thursday* *6 PM*. Please make sure that you submit your response before that because the *Academic Board* keeps a very strict check on these things. 
 
The aim of this activity is to make you aware of the life journey of Patrice Motsepe and how you can inculcate his traits in your daily life.
15/07/22, 18:12 - Unknown: After you have gone through the above messave regarding the Wednesday Lesson, Let us start with our previous discussion on your scholarship credits.
15/07/22, 18:20 - Asher EWYL22E0064: Good morning,sir. I hope you are doing well. May l kindly know the Wednesday activity you are taking about because as much as l know l have written all the assignments , l am only left out with the one you sent yesterday.
15/07/22, 18:22 - Asher EWYL22E0064: Hello sir?
15/07/22, 19:01 - Unknown: Good Morning, Asher ?
I hope that you are good health and spirits
15/07/22, 19:02 - Unknown: I am talking about the activiry that I shared with you yesterday in the batch group
15/07/22, 19:22 - Asher EWYL22E0064: *What Mr Patrice Mastepe inspired me* 

Mr Patrice Mastepe inspired me that as an entrepreneur , l should​ not be discouraged by failing. He failed many times but he had self-confidence that he can make it . He grabbed all the golden opportunities that came on his way , failure made him to look for another opportunities.

He also inspired me to surround myself with brighter people. As an entrepreneur l should not stop learning. I should surround myself with smartest people who l can exchange business ideas and plans with. 

Moving on, Mr Patrice Mastepe inspired me to keep on moving , keep on dreaming. His parents were in business and they used to close their shop  at midnight . Staying behind the shop counter taught him what profitability is all about. Later in life he became a lawyer because it was his dream. He realised that he strength was in business when he was already a lawyer ,so whatever stage you are now you can change your decision and have a better goal.

You have to do a research on project that you what to do . You don't have to just keep a conclusion of your project without making a thorough research . This will reduces​ some unnecessary expenses and mistakes .

Money is important , yes! But having money does not equate for happiness. It is significantly more important in pursuing the dream and interest that you have, do the right thing and that will make you happy.

Work harder , do some sacrifices and focus this will make you successful.Do not listen to people who discourages you . When starting a business some people will say that the business will not succeed .Be innovative.Live life to the fullest of your potential. Keep on going and going!
15/07/22, 19:26 - Asher EWYL22E0064: I hope we can continue, sir.
