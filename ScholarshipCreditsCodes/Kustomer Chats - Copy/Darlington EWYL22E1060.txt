18/08/23, 13:32 - Darlington EWYL22E1060: Ok l will explain to them
18/08/23, 13:35 - Jasmine Kaur: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!üéâ
18/08/23, 13:36 - Darlington EWYL22E1060: Ok
18/08/23, 13:38 - Jasmine Kaur: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countriesüìç
18/08/23, 13:39 - Darlington EWYL22E1060: Ok
18/08/23, 13:40 - Jasmine Kaur: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
18/08/23, 13:45 - Darlington EWYL22E1060: Ok
18/08/23, 13:48 - Jasmine Kaur: Photo

19/08/23, 12:09 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

Get ready to embark on a journey of creativity as for today's Saturday Activity you have the opportunity to craft a short story based on one of the following three values:

1. Perseverance:
Write about a character who faces obstacles and perseveres to achieve success. Show their journey as they conquer adversity and emerge stronger.

2. Diversity and Inclusion:
Feature characters from different backgrounds, initially in conflict due to their differences. Show how their relationships evolve as they learn to value and celebrate each other's perspectives.

3. Gratitude:
Follow a character who learns to appreciate life's beauty and express gratitude for the people and experiences that enrich their life. Explore their growth as they foster appreciation and inspire others.

Choose a value that resonates with you. Your words can evoke emotions and leave a lasting impression. We eagerly await your creative stories that reflect the values shaping our lives.

Happy writing!

29/08/23, 19:21 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

Hope you are doing well, I would like to announce that tomorrow is a holiday on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan which is an auspicious Indian Festival so I am sharing the lesson with you today!

So for this week's Wednesday lesson,  I have an exciting topic to delve into: Hidden Talent.
We'll dive into the captivating story of Samuel, a character whose seemingly ordinary life takes a fascinating turn when his secret talent comes to light. Through his story, we'll discover the power of talents that lie beneath the surface, waiting for the perfect moment to shine.
So, bring your curiosity and imagination as we delve into Samuel's tale and discuss the significance of hidden talents in our own lives. You might even find yourself reflecting on your own unique abilities that are yet to be revealed.

In our upcoming session I would like to know if you have a hidden talent that you're particularly good at or passionate about? It could be anything ‚Äì from artistic pursuits to something more unexpected.

Get ready to be inspired, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together!
