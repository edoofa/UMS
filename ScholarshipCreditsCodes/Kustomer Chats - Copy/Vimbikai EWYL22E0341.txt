Below is your weekend task!

I will take an update on Monday *10 AM*
Hello my dear Edoofians
Hope you are doing well. This week we learned about one of the most popular yet grounded people who used social media as a tool to become an educator and give back to the community and still become an entrepreneur.
This week I want you to reflect on what your strengths and skills are to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 

These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content etc.
Please share these skills and instances where you were able to showcase these skills on Monday
Till then 
Happy Learning!
16/10/22, 19:57 - Vimbikai EWYL22E0341: Ok thank you ma'am

20/10/22, 02:54 - Vimbikai EWYL22E0341: I have a lot of friends who I talked to about edoofa and they are really interested in joining the scholarship program, yes they can afford the 200 enrollment fee,700 registration fee but for the tution fees on indian universities they will only have to rely on EWYLP because of financial instability at home .Is it possible to rely on the EWYLPS ......I'm also concerned about this as a proud edoofian. When doing my community building project I discovered that there are some bad romours about the Edoofa scholarship program which I don't actually believe so we're facing some challenges when talking to headmasters and students as well. I wanted to address that on the call but I failed to connect due to network problems. As one of the proud edoofians I thought of telling you so that we could work best on stopping those false romours so that this program keep on helping many students to achieve their dreams. I have two students who I talked to and they said they once did the counseling and couldn't proceed because of those false romours but I talked to them and reconnected them to my counselor.

How are you?
20/10/22, 21:24 - Unknown: Yes, very happy that you analyzed this problem and took a step ahead to solve it, proud of you.
Can we get on a call tomorrow and come to ways that can help in solving the situation?
I can be available from 2-3 PM IST or 7-8 PM IST.
Let me know.
20/10/22, 21:25 - Unknown: I am happy to tell you that this weekend we are having our great Indian festival, Deepawali and you know this festival holds a special place in the hearts of all Indian families. So yesterday, everyone in our office wore Ethnic dresses and celebrate Deepawali's party where we exchanged gifts and lit up the office with diyas and candles.
Due to this, there was a delay in sending you the Wednesday lesson for this week.
Please see to it and we will have a session tomorrow on the same because I want to give you time to ponder and work on it.
20/10/22, 21:25 - Unknown: In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

What do you think?
09/08/22, 21:54 - Vimbikai EWYL22E0341: Yah that's great
09/08/22, 22:53 - Unknown: ou were probably encouraged by this week's featured entrepreneur, Gilbert Eugune Peters, to keep seeking any chance to further your goals, develop yourself, and get ready for a better future. When he was just 19 years old, he launched his first business. Continuous learning is a must, and the industry leaders are a great source to learn from. You must unravel the secrets of Gilbert's success and identify the traits that made him the successful star he is today as part of your Saturday Submission.

You can use the internet for assistance. You must share the submission over a designated EWYL line in your Batch as discussed, and the word count for it must be between 150 and 200 words.

20/08/22, 18:20 - Vimbikai EWYL22E0341: Gilbert Eugune Peters was just 19 when he launched his first business. From what I have read I have seen that he was passionate about graphic design. Some people, friends and other close relatives of course had different views towards his dream but he didn't turn back he remained focused. He fist worked as an Internet cafe assistant and at the same time he hustlesd as a satellite dish installer . This is where he got $300 to start his career journey . He just rented at first but now he has managed to establish very great and wonderful buildings 
*Traits toward his success
Gilbert managed to mantain his confidence despite all the discouragements . He became very successful because he did what he was passionate at . If he focused on engineering maybe he wouldn't have reached where he is right now . So doing what you're good at and what you enjoy brings success.
The other reason why he became successful is because he partnered with the right people. If he focused with those who had different views towards his dream he wouldn't have made this far he would have changed and do something else . He also surrounded himself with people who encouraged and saw the in him like her girlfriend because at one point she even secrificed her salary so that he would pay his rentals . It was just $160 but it helped a lot. That support helped him to reach his dream

24/08/22, 22:39 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

25/08/22, 04:18 - Vimbikai EWYL22E0341: Identification of skills that make us successful . I have learnt a great lesson today.Its very little things that bring out very great things like what happened to cde Modi who started with 2 pairs of clothes and $50 in his pocket but he built 11 supermarkets out of it though it was a long journey . They were ups and downs throughout the way like when he was ineed of $30 but his boss failed to help him .He ended up quiting the job and working somewhere else . After reading this I have also learnt that sometimes you need to put yourself at risk so that you can be successful like what he did  .if he kept holding on that job he wouldn't have made this far maybe. From Dr Chiyangwa's story I also learned very useful skills of life. Being business minded helped him to reach where he is right now. He started as a vendor first , going to fields buying vegetables and selling . He got employed at New York house.He first introduced himself to the business environment and that way he made it to the end . lessons learned
Nomatter what it is you have to try by all means to do business and make money out of it. By selling vegetables I guess Mr Chiyangwa also gained skills to interact with successful people which was also useful to his business project 
.Even if we look at cde muhambi he started his business in high school by selling one cell phone but it took him somewhere
.
25/08/22, 04:18 - Vimbikai EWYL22E0341: From all the stories I have just learnt that the sky is the limit , there are a lot of things we can we can start business from
02/10/22, 04:14 - Vimbikai EWYL22E0341: Greetings ma'am

So I was telling him about Edoofa scholarship program and he appreciated that it is a really great program I gave that form that headmasters fill but he suggested to have an online meeting with you without filling the form.
