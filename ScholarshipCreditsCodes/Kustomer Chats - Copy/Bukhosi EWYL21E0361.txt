12/07/22, 21:23 - Tenzin: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

09/08/22, 05:54 - Bukhosi EWYL21E0361: Greetings.

I am responding to the weekend assignment which is unravel the secrets of Gilbert’s  Eugene Peter’s success and identifying the traitss that made him the successful star he is today.


Firstly,confidence,Gilbert mentions that if one is willing to be successful he or she has to be confident,that is to ignore it all and focus om the dream, on the victory that will come.

Gilbert believed that when one steps into his or her purpose,there are people that are put in their paths by God to help them along the journey.

Also one has to believe in oneself when no one else does,again that sometimes when an idea is at birth ,not many will see it the way you do believe in it yourself .

Gilbert mentions about keeping a wonderful self discipline,everyone procrastinates and everyone has a vice or two ,however minor .But those who care continually  never let discractions to overtake them. instead,they have discipline to force themselves to keep at it ,even when feeling the urge to do something less important.

Lastly,passion ,which  can be energizing ,and can help one through difficult moments.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off
