19/07/22, 21:19 - Lisben EWYL22E0052: I am lisben and my mentor is Mr Anshul
19/07/22, 23:38 - Unknown: Hello Lisben, how are you doing? I am Mr. Anshul, and you will now reach out to me here to connect with me.
19/07/22, 23:38 - Unknown: Lisben, Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"
19/07/22, 23:38 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
19/07/22, 23:38 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves
19/07/22, 23:51 - Lisben EWYL22E0052: OK sir
19/07/22, 23:57 - Unknown: Great that you have understood this. So what message do you have to send me here on a daily basis.
20/07/22, 00:02 - Lisben EWYL22E0052: I have to sent a message saying \" I am a proud Edoofian\"
20/07/22, 00:04 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

20/07/22, 01:14 - Unknown: i am really glad that you are able to understand this.
20/07/22, 01:14 - Unknown: Now let me also share with you the weekend activity with you to work on and submit.
20/07/22, 01:14 - Unknown: Its that time of the week, when you are required to wear your thinking caps and get your tools ready to research and learn! From our Wednesday Wisdom, we learnt how Patrice Motsepe, became successful by making the best of the opportunity very few could see, the strong potential in the mining industry. As part of your Saturday Activity you are required to share a detailed submission on the fast growing industry\/sector\/business in your country. Don’t forget to add a SWOT analysis and the predictions on the future performance of the same.

Word limit- 250-500 words. \u2028Use of internet is allowed but do not copy the entire submission from internet. You have to write it in your own words.

22/07/22, 17:11 - Lisben EWYL22E0052: From the Wednesday wisdom I learnt that success comes through hard work and sacrifice. Being able to have a positive mind towards your future, it enables you to be triumphant in life and be able to fulfill your dreams. Amongst that also one should not be able to say, \"I can't do this, its too difficult\", by saying this you will be accepting failure in life. Thus that's what I captured from the lesson.

A well-constructed timetable establishes a natural rhythm and routine, which can be comforting students as well as their mentors. Having a plan as a learner is very important as it helps you maximize and prioritize on the things that are of urgency or importance. Most students do not have an organized study plan and if they do, they fail to follow the plan drawn. As the Wednesday Wisdom offered advice on how to use our time wisely. You must share your daily schedules with your mentors as part of your Saturday activity in the format that has been provided to you. I've given you the image of a timetable; you can draw it on paper and show it to your mentors. Do not forget to provide the scheduled time for your EWYL programme.

Happy learning and growing!

And while we wish you all the luck for it, we don't want you to miss out on your learning and skill building. In today's lesson, we will discuss how to build our capacity to multitask, manage our time and prioritize our daily tasks in order to have it all. 

Let's dig right in, and understand how if you follow these steps, you will be able to manage your exams, assignments, extra curriculars, and your EWYL projects all at one go. After going through this, you must discuss the plan of action to execute these steps with your mentors.

Happy Learning!

08/10/22, 18:56 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!

13/10/22, 01:19 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.

20/10/22, 01:04 - Unknown: Hello, My Proud Edoofian.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

28/10/22, 19:00 - Unknown: Hello, My Dear Proud Edoofian.

We all know that \"History is Written by Winners\", but not everybody knows the discipline, dedication, sacrifices, time, and efforts put behind it.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the kind of mindset a winner possesses, and about the person who carved his way from the bottom to the top, and even beyond. The story of a basketball player turning into a lethal black mamba on the court, the habits he formed, and the mindset he forged, to turn into a winner, is inspirational and the most practical way to better oneself every single day. You will learn a lot of different things from this lesson, about the attitude, instinct, and character of a true all-round winner.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

I hope you are doing well.

\"A goal is not always meant to be reached; it often serves simply as something to aim at.\" –Bruce Lee

The above quote more or less means True success is all about working towards meaningful goals and dreams.

And this was somewhat the idea we learned and discussed in our Wednesday Lesson as well, the mindset of a winner and the habits that lead to it.

In this week's activity, you shall be putting this to use in your working zone, by creating a list of targets\/goals, that you shall aim to achieve in a week. For a suggestion, you can start by setting up several Schools you would try connecting to in a week, the number of companies you shall reach out to, or the number of fellow community mates you would tell about the roof.

This list, you shall share this with your mentors, and they will also keep a note of it. At the end of the week, you shall discuss with them, whether or not you were able to achieve the target, and what kind of mindset change did this activity lead you to.

I hope you all will try to push your limits and aim at the sky always. This activity should be a part of habit-building, making you a better and more organized individual and professional.

Happy Learning, and Blessed Weekend.
