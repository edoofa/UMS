20/01/24, 20:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings on this beautiful dayâœ¨

Hello My Proud Edoofian,

Hope this message finds you well! This Saturday's activity is an exciting opportunity to delve deeper into the principles of the book 'Think and Grow Rich" by Napoleon Hill ' discussed in our Wednesday lesson. Each of you is required to elaborate on one of the seven principles shared in the Wednesday Lesson. Provide a detailed explanation, and don't forget to include examples to illustrate the practical application of the chosen principle.

This task is crucial as it will not only reinforce your understanding but also prepare you for our upcoming session with mentors. Remember, the more detailed and insightful your submission, the more enriching the discussion will be.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarification. Looking forward to your insightful contributions!

Best,
Team EWYL
