I also understood that there is one powerful tool  that can guide me which is goal setting. If I have goal settings,I can provide my direction and purpose. 

It also embrace learning  and skill development by identify areas where I can expand my knowledge and commit to lifelong learning. It also promote a Healthy Work-Life balance through ensuring a balance between work, personal life and self care. 

Through goal settings I can enhance Goal clarity and planning where by I can breakdown larger goals into manageable tasks  and create a road map for achievement.
