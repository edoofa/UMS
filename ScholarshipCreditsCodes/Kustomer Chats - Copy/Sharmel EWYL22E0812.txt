16/12/22, 21:37 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

17/12/22, 18:46 - Unknown: A very good morning Sharmel!
17/12/22, 20:16 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!
17/12/22, 20:37 - Sharmel EWYL22E0812: Morning sir
17/12/22, 20:37 - Sharmel EWYL22E0812: I am a proud Edoofian
17/12/22, 20:38 - Unknown: - That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!

17/12/22, 20:39 - Sharmel EWYL22E0812: Okay sir
18/12/22, 20:54 - Sharmel EWYL22E0812: Good morning  Mr Maurice
18/12/22, 20:54 - Sharmel EWYL22E0812: Christmas is a widely celebrated festival commemorating birth of Jesus Christ. It is a special day celebrated on the 25th day of December. It is where people gather as family, friends or even neighbors just yo celebrate,  or share stories. It is more special when people give or receive gifts even the smallest one still counts, or a song, a poet designed with love. I want to be my aunt's secret Santa this Christmas. I want to buy her a necklace that has a picture of her specially made for, because ever since my mother died she has been my pillar of strength. There were times I would breakdown, fail or think I am all alone in this world but she was there to comfort me, give me the kind of affection I needed, provided me with anything I wanted. With all that,  she is a mother figure,  she gives me mother's love and I don't feel left out. 
Moreover,  I want to be my bestfriend Amanda' s secret Santa because she understands me more than anything, she knows what to do if I am all quiet and sad at the same time. She always makes me laugh even when I am in pain. I would like to print her a t-shirt with her face on it because she deserves it. I am so greatful with the kind of people I have in my life.
19/12/22, 18:20 - Unknown: A very good morning Sharmel!
19/12/22, 18:20 - Unknown: Very beautifully explained! Very sweet of you to be your aunt's secret santa!

The feedback we have received from some of you on this week’s Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.
As part of this week’s Saturday Activity, you are required to share your written submission on : 
What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?
There is no word limit, so feel free to express your understanding in detail. The second answer requires some mental work, so sit with yourself, introspect, and share your honest answer with your mentor. 
Let this activity play an important role in your personal goal setting. We will connect soon in our upcoming session. 
Till then, happy learning and happy growing!","transform":"
