12/07/22, 21:56 - Unknown: Why is that Mthulisi? You know I suggest that you should and that too with a short message so people can watch the video take your help to apply for the program.
12/07/22, 22:26 - Memory EWYL20E0154: I will sir
12/07/22, 23:17 - Unknown: Great, so I suggest that you draft the message and share with me so I can help you make it better?
13/07/22, 01:09 - Unknown: Please excuse me for using the incorrect name Memory.  May I ask how your internship work is going on? How does it feel to interact with others in the work environment?
13/07/22, 17:06 - Unknown: Hello Memory! How are you doing?
13/07/22, 18:29 - Memory EWYL20E0154: I am a proud Edoofian
13/07/22, 18:29 - Memory EWYL20E0154: Good morning Sir, how are you?
13/07/22, 18:30 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

14/07/22, 21:42 - Unknown: \"Success is Not Final, Failure is Not Fatal: it is the Courage to Continue that Counts\"- Winston Churchill 

Greeting of the day my proud Edoofian! How are you doing?
14/07/22, 22:10 - Unknown: Did you work on the Wednesday wisdom task I shared with you yesterday Memory?

Personally I found it very interesting as it discussed the life and struggles of Patrice, an African Billionaire and I believe my students should take inspiration from him.
15/07/22, 19:57 - Unknown: Hello Memory!
25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off
