29/05/23, 15:24 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
29/05/23, 15:26 - Tapiwanashe EWYL23E0031: 4. All of the above
29/05/23, 16:04 - Ananya: Hi Tapiwanashe!
29/05/23, 16:06 - Tapiwanashe EWYL23E0031: How are you doing today Sir
29/05/23, 16:06 - Ananya: I am doing well! Are you ready for your session? I have an interesting activity for you!
29/05/23, 16:09 - Tapiwanashe EWYL23E0031: Yes sir I am more than ready
29/05/23, 16:12 - Ananya: Great!
Greetings My Dear Proud Edoofian!

""Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it."" ~ Bruce Lee

In this week's Wednesday lesson, you learned about the different sorts of personalities a person carries, but only a true leader is one who understands their personality and can do wonders with its power. In today's activity, I want you to dig deeper into your own consciousness and learn more about the kind of personality you are. As I believe, the more you know yourself, the clearer your vision of the world and your mind gets. Below is a link to a personality test, which you shall be taking up this week, and then would be sharing the results via a screenshot to your mentors by Monday. You can then read and understand more about your results by discussing them with your Mentor.

Link to the Test: -
https://my-personality-test.com/true-colours

This particular exercise is going to give you an insight into the kind of person you are so that you can use your strengths to yield the maximum benefits in whatever work you take up.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own personality while performing this activity.

05/06/23, 14:59 - Ananya:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, Let me share a small story with you!
 Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came. 
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.
The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell: 

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. 
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
