12/10/22, 00:21 - Unknown: As you know, the IndianDoc project has been going on for a while now (for around 20–30 days). We would like to appreciate your efforts and input on this project. However, it did not pan out in the way we originally wanted. We have been very patient for you to perform, as Ms. Sanjana, our Career Development Coach and I, believed in your intent and competency, but it is not fair to us as a team and to you as a student to redundantly focus on input patterns that are not output driven. 
Hence, we would like to continue with our sessions, as usual, and participate well in them to ensure that this project stands as a great learning opportunity for the upcoming ones.
12/10/22, 00:23 - Natalie EWYL22E0282: Yes. Sir thank you for the opportunity

I hope that you are in good health and spirits
