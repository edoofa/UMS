28/06/23, 15:59 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

Tell us if these were helpful for you in the comments below!
30/06/23, 15:48 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello! Are you ready for the session?
30/06/23, 15:55 - Nyashadzashe EWYL23E0028: Yes
30/06/23, 16:00 - Jasmine Kaur: Pursuing dreams and ambitions in life is an important aspect of personal growth and success. The story of Alex, the average student with a burning desire to achieve great things, is quite inspiring.
Often, it's not just innate talent or intelligence that leads to extraordinary accomplishments, but rather the passion and determination to overcome challenges and work hard towards one's goals. Alex's story resonates with many students who may not consider themselves the most talented or smartest, but who possess that inner drive to make a difference in their lives.
30/06/23, 16:01 - Nyashadzashe EWYL23E0028: The moral story is about success lies not only  in the achievement of external goals but also in becoming the person you aspire to be .
30/06/23, 16:32 - Jasmine Kaur: Absolutely! The moral of the story emphasizes that success goes beyond the mere achievement of external goals. It involves the journey of personal growth and becoming the person you aspire to be. While external accomplishments are important, true success lies in the development of your character, values, and inner qualities.
30/06/23, 16:33 - Jasmine Kaur: Now have you understood the document I have shared regarding the Edoofa grant?
30/06/23, 16:42 - Nyashadzashe EWYL23E0028: As any Edoofian you have to work hard and be focused towards your goals . And also try to over come challenges that you face  that will improve your personal growth and make   choices according to ur talent so that you be come the person aspire to be .
30/06/23, 16:47 - Jasmine Kaur: Absolutely! As an Edoofian, working hard, staying focused on your goals, and overcoming challenges are essential for personal growth and success. It's important to embrace a strong work ethic and a determined mindset to make progress towards your aspirations.
30/06/23, 16:47 - Jasmine Kaur: We have been having sessions regularly however let me redefine what a session is again.
In order for us to have a successful session, I will be evaluating each session on 3 particular points to be eligible for the Grant.

1. You have to share the "Proud Edoofian" ritual before 12:00PM to mark your attendance
2. You have to share your understanding and complete the Wednesday Lesson or Saturday Activity task before your next session and submit it before the session starts.
3. Between the Community Building and the School Project, you have to choose either one of them or both for the next 21 days and we will set the targets by 1st July, which you will be completing by the end of the 21 days. 

And last but not the least, you will have to come up with something which you think will make you stand out from the rest. It will be your best skill so you can discuss with me about this today over the Session.
30/06/23, 16:51 - Nyashadzashe EWYL23E0028: Noted.. what do you mean l should come up with something wch you think you stand out from the rest .... example plzz

01/07/23, 13:58 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!
