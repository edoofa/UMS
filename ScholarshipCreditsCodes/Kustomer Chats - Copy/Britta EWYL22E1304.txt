13/03/23, 22:30 - Tenzin: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

15/03/23, 18:33 - Tenzin: Hello my Proud Edoofian,
This week's Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the topic of \"Seeking Wealth, not Money or Status.\" This is an important lesson that will provide valuable insights into the pursuit of financial stability and success. During this lesson, we will explore the concept of wealth and its importance in building a sustainable financial future. We will discuss the difference between wealth, money, and status, and how each of these concepts plays a role in our lives.
I encourage you to read the lesson in detail and take notes to fully understand the material. It is important to engage with this topic and think critically about your own financial goals and aspirations.
By understanding the importance of seeking wealth over money or status, you can develop a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial success. I look forward to exploring this topic with you in more detail during our upcoming lesson.

16/03/23, 19:59 - Britta EWYL22E1304: This document has provided me with intense wisdom that I can proudly share with others in future. I've learnt that while most people are pressurised to earn vast amounts of money, only wise people would be busy chasing after sustainable wealth! In as much as money is valuable, it should not be the main goal behind one's hard work. Money comes to pass while wealth provides a lifetime guarantee. Earning wealth can assure one with a stable and promising future for their family and offspring. On the other hand, today's generation has a tendency of wanting societal status and fame to the extent that they can risk their own happiness for it. It is true that status is a good thing to obtain but people must be careful not to prioritize it as if it is their source of income. Moreover, having a high rank in society can force one to lead a fake life all in the name of pleasing the society itself!
16/03/23, 20:01 - Tenzin: Dear Proud Edoofian,

20/03/23, 17:42 - Tenzin: Hello my proud Edoofian!

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!","transform":"

23/03/23, 22:01 - Tenzin: Great! Now can your share your understanding of the lesson with me?
23/03/23, 22:22 - Britta EWYL22E1304: Well, this document was teaching about the concept of wealth from a different angle! It was talking about earning wealth by ethical means. It clarified on the misconceptions that most people have that wealth can only be earned by unholy ways hence most people despise it. However it is a wrong belief that has been spread worldwide since one can actually obtain wealth such clean ways for example indulgence in business investments. Another important fact that I noted was that one must not pursue wealth for selfish motives but must consider the benefits of other people that are involved in obtaining that wealth too!
23/03/23, 22:38 - Tenzin: Yes, you are absolutely right. Wealth can be obtained through ethical means, such as investing in businesses or providing value to others through products or services. It's a misconception that wealth can only be earned through dishonest or immoral means.

Furthermore, it's important to consider the impact our pursuit of wealth has on others. Pursuing wealth solely for personal gain without considering the well-being of others can be harmful and unethical. Ethical wealth creation involves creating value for others in a sustainable and fair manner.
23/03/23, 22:38 - Tenzin: Thank you for sharing your insights on this topic.
