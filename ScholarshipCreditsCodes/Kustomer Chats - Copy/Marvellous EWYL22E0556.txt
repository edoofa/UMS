How are you?
07/10/22, 22:22 - Saloni Rastogi: As students, we constantly learn and expose ourselves to situations that help us learn anything and everything, but we must remember that each of us has the same number of hours in a day. Hence we must treat it important that we treat our Time as the currency of life. *Time Management* is essentially Priority Management.

In our session today on the *EWYL Line*, we will discuss:
1. How managing time is necessary
2. pending discussion on the weekend activity
07/10/22, 22:54 - Marvellous EWYL22E0556: Alright

In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. Those unfamiliar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.
Responses will be accepted on the *EWYL Line* only.

16/03/23, 04:54 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian,
This week's Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the topic of \"Seeking Wealth, not Money or Status.\" This is an important lesson that will provide valuable insights into the pursuit of financial stability and success. During this lesson, we will explore the concept of wealth and its importance in building a sustainable financial future. We will discuss the difference between wealth, money, and status, and how each of these concepts plays a role in our lives.
I encourage you to read the lesson in detail and take notes to fully understand the material. It is important to engage with this topic and think critically about your own financial goals and aspirations.
By understanding the importance of seeking wealth over money or status, you can develop a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial success. I look forward to exploring this topic with you in more detail during our upcoming lesson.

Happy learning!","transform":"

This is what have get from that
09/01/23, 22:40 - Marvellous EWYL22E0556: What are you looking for in a pen? Do you love your pens? And do you have that one go -to pen that you use on impossible occasions because you know it writes well and looks great? What do you use a pen for? Do you jot down notes during a meeting or phone call? Do you sometimes use a pen to sign important documents or contracts, or even letters or Christmas cards? And if you use a pen in front of others, do the optics matter to you? Would you prefer to use the kind of pen used by well to do people, or will just any old pen do?
Perfect. The thing about nice pens is they not only look good, but they write great. This pen right here is one of our newer models. It has some gold platting on top of sterling silver, but it's not all that heavy. And it's write like a dream. Take it, find a piece of paper on your desk and sign your name. You don't have to scribble on a piece of scratch paper first to see if the ink comes out _ I guarantee you the ink will come out.  And it's not expensive - it's valuable. You can afford this pen , and you can carry it with you everywhere. Refillable cartridges will make sure you never run out of ink. Tell you what, keep the pen a week, use it's everyday, see if it's disappoints you.

09/01/23, 22:40 - Marvellous EWYL22E0556: I am a proud edoofian
09/01/23, 22:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

How are you?

''Sell me this pen.''
It is a very prominent sales statement kept in front of various upcoming leaders.
This weekend's activity was basically asking you how would you answer the same in the most creative and unique manner.

In today's session on the EWYL Line:
1) we will discuss your pitch to sell a pen to me in the most unique and creative manner
2) progress on the project chosen
3) pending Wednesday's lesson response
10/01/23, 17:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am proud edoofian'.
10/01/23, 17:58 - Saloni Rastogi: I have received your Wednesday lesson views, please omit the third point
10/01/23, 19:36 - Marvellous EWYL22E0556: I am a proud edoofian
10/01/23, 19:37 - Saloni Rastogi: - That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!

10/01/23, 21:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Can I have your views on the weekend activity, please?
10/01/23, 21:29 - Marvellous EWYL22E0556: It's awesome for one maybe able to build a good reputation of his or her image of the consensus which are reciprocity, scarcity commitment and consistency, authority, liking and consensus or social proof.
This is what have get from that
10/01/23, 21:42 - Saloni Rastogi: The description you shared for that is amazing, the way you have presented is astonishing!
I mean the way you interpreted is beyond anyone can think of... :fireworks:
10/01/23, 21:49 - Marvellous EWYL22E0556: Thank you ma'am
10/01/23, 21:51 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know what about the company connect project?
10/01/23, 21:56 - Marvellous EWYL22E0556: Am still looking for one 
I had found but they stopped responding to me
10/01/23, 22:06 - Saloni Rastogi: I know you must have messaged so many leaders, founders, managers, associates, and many more people on their LinkedIn but haven't received any response yet I can completely understand this because most of the time these leaders are occupied in their daily routines and often do not get time to respond to messages. Since our focus has always been to earn scholarship credit, we will just wait for 1 to 2 days for their reply but in case they don't reply, I have an alternative through which you can earn scholarship credits.
10/01/23, 22:07 - Saloni Rastogi: What you can do is Google the information about the company and bring it to me through the form. For example, if there is a company named ABCD and we have sent a message to the leader of the company and he has not replied for 1 to 2 days. Don't wait any more time. We can google the name of the company, search for all the relevant information that is required in the form like the name of the company, name of the contact person, designation of the person, and so on, fill out the form and share it with me. 
After receiving the form I will ask our project head, Ms. Sanjana, to arrange a call with the concerned person and in case of a successful call, you will get $2 of scholarship credits
10/01/23, 22:08 - Marvellous EWYL22E0556: Alright ma'am
10/01/23, 22:08 - Marvellous EWYL22E0556: Okay

10/01/23, 22:29 - Saloni Rastogi: I hope you remember the three projects that I explained to you elaborately.

There are simply five notions which when are followed though roughly can create a bright future for a person. And those notions are simplicity, numerical fluency, invert, study the basics, and lastly lollapalooza effect.
These are the five notions to invert in the brain ?
16/01/23, 06:51 - Marvellous EWYL22E0556: The problem was within the family not on my own so we had to solve it as a  family. Here came my sister who's 20 years old and she's doing grade 9 the second born in our family. Suddenly she just came and said she wants to get married, us as sisters were there, shocked about her decision cause she's still in school. We tried to show her all the possible outcome of early marriage and tried to stop her from getting married, we showed her the importance of education as well but she wasn't ready to take it. It's took a while she just came and said if u guys won't allow me to get married I'll commit suicide. We had no solution solution but the only one that we had to so we can reserve the life of our sister. That's when we gave concern for her to get married despite her agement and education before her.

Moreover, you have not shared past Wednesday's lesson response as well.
17/01/23, 21:24 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, we will be moving ahead with the PeeBuddy Project Today.
17/01/23, 21:30 - Saloni Rastogi: I can very well relate to what you said about the 5 problem-solving strategies proposed by Charlie Munger.
I related most to the line, “Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Systematically you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. Nevertheless, you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts. Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day – if you live long enough – most people get what they deserve.”
17/01/23, 21:34 - Saloni Rastogi: The situation that you conquered was quite tough honestly and one wrong decision could have resulted in devastating results. How is she doing now?
17/01/23, 23:04 - Marvellous EWYL22E0556: This project is set for youths who has a great version , motivated and has the zeal to create a strong phase for his or her future.
