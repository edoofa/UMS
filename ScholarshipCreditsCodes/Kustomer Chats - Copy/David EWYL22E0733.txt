19/09/23, 17:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings David!
How are you?
19/09/23, 17:47 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
19/09/23, 17:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - “I am a proud Edoofian”
19/09/23, 17:48 - Saloni Rastogi: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter

3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
19/09/23, 17:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *09:30-11:00 AM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
19/09/23, 18:08 - David EWYL22E0733: Am fine thanks how are you

04/10/23, 15:04 - David EWYL22E0733: My weekend was great and a time to interact with my friends,  I also shared something about the Edoofa programme to two colleagues.  I was also discussing with my parents if I could subscribe for reading in the library in Lilongwe, Malawi. I was involved in drawing cartoons 
I also had a walk to the our trading centre to buy something for the family. But largely,  I was also reading and started communicating with Dad in French. 
This is what happened.
04/10/23, 15:51 - Saloni Rastogi: This is great David, can you share something about your drawing piece?
04/10/23, 16:05 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofians,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning

04/10/23, 16:06 - Saloni Rastogi: This is our Wednesday lesson, you need to share what has been asked in the lesson in your session along with the project discussion that we will be doing. I hope you have understood now.
04/10/23, 16:21 - David EWYL22E0733: Yes understood 🤝
05/10/23, 13:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello David!
I hope you are doing well.

Today, we're discussing the *importance of belonging to a community in our journey towards success.*

Belonging to a community, whether it's a family, a social group, or a professional network, can be incredibly motivating. It gives us a sense of purpose and a desire to contribute and be recognized. Communities provide a support system that helps us overcome obstacles, and they are rich sources of knowledge and expertise.

As we explore the significance of belongingness, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic and any project updates you might have. Please share your views and updates here.
05/10/23, 13:19 - David EWYL22E0733: Am very good and you madam Saloni . Am I waiting eagerly to know the importance of belonging to a community. 🤝
05/10/23, 13:22 - Saloni Rastogi: In every session David, you have to share what you have understood after going through the lesson/activity and then we will discuss on it.
05/10/23, 13:22 - Saloni Rastogi: So now can you share what you have understood from the lesson?
05/10/23, 15:55 - David EWYL22E0733: What u have learnt from the lesson is that, why is the sense of belonginess important for success: 

1. *Motivation and inspiration* . This point is trying to explain when one belongs to a family of community. One's work can be easily motivated by the members thus brings power to the doer.
2. *Support system* .  One can be easily supported by the members thus contribute to good outcomes of a project. 
3. *Knowledge sharing* . This is where most of the family members can tell you 💡 ideas on how to succeed on a certain project. 
4. *Network opportunities*. Not only being in a family makes one successful, but also makes one to connect to others .
5. *Accountability*. In this point, one van interact with peers and this helps one to have discipline and that ensuring the work is consistently towards one's goal. 
6. *Emotional well-being*. If one has a feeling of belonging to somewhere is boosts the self confidence and reduces the stress. 
7. *Diverse perspectives*. Since people have different backgrounds, they are able to explain them to their members on what's right as in a way of doing things to avoid remorse.
8. *Recognition and validation*. Success is not only achieving goals but also feeling the sense of accomplishment.😌
9. *Legacy and impact*. If one is in a community it allows you to leave a lasting legacy and make a meaningful impact. The contribution of a person cannot only help him or her but also the future generation. 🤝
05/10/23, 16:00 - David EWYL22E0733: What I have learnt from the lesson***
05/10/23, 17:32 - Saloni Rastogi: I appreciate your thoughtful insights on the importance of a sense of belonging for success. It's clear that being part of a community or group can significantly enhance motivation, support, knowledge sharing, networking, accountability, emotional well-being, diverse perspectives, recognition, and even leave a lasting legacy.
A fascinating fact about belonging to a community is that studies have shown that it can actually increase your lifespan. People with strong social connections tend to live longer, healthier lives compared to those who feel isolated. So, being part of a community not only boosts your chances of success but also contributes to a longer, more fulfilling life! 🌟🤗
