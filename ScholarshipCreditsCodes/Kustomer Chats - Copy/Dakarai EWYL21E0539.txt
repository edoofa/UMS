How's your day going?
28/07/22, 23:33 - Unknown: Time management is defined as using your time productively and efficiently—but what about when you are working as productively as possible, and you still can’t get everything done? It may be better to think about time management as a combination of working productively and prioritizing your time.

Our *Wednesday Wisdom* was all about Time Management and understanding the priority matrix to organize our tasks. 
I am really excited to hear your understanding and working on the same.
Please share it with me here.
In today's session we will talk about:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. progress on community building projects.
29/07/22, 00:57 - Dakarai EWYL21E0539: I have learnt that time management is the combination of utilising our productively and effectively. Our tasks are divided into those that are important and those that are urgent. Important tasks are those that matter and failure to do them has consequences and urgent tasks are those that demand attention but don't have consequences if they are not carried out. The Priority Matrix helps us to know which tasks to do first in their order of priority. We have to do
1) Tasks with high importance and high urgency (first)
2) Tasks with high importance and low urgency (second). Can be scheduled.
3) Tasks with high urgency and low importance ( third). Can be delegated.
4) Tasks with low importance and low urgency ( we may opt not to do them)

02/08/22, 00:18 - Unknown: I had a lovely weekend, thanks for asking.
02/08/22, 00:24 - Unknown: A timetable is a framework that lets individuals see specific activities lined up. In this framework, it shows the tie allotment among several tasks and courses. It ensures equal distribution of time among activities and subjects, creates a smooth workflow, prevents wasting of time and efforts, and aids in creating good habits.
The *weekend activity* asked you to draw a timetable for yourself and of course, have time for your scheduled sessions as well.
I am really excited to see your timetable on the EWYL Line and of course, we can discuss how we can manage our sessions accordingly.
In this session today, we will discuss:
1. your timetable (as a part of the weekend activity)
2. progress on community building projects
02/08/22, 00:24 - Unknown: You can share it with me in this format.
