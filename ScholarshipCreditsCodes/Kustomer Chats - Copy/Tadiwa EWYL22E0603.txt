07/02/23, 19:28 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr

11/02/23, 21:39 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian, first of all, I would like to congratulate you on being selected for the Social Media Project. I have been observing your active participation and interest in the EWYL program so I have chosen you to take part in a special project where you will learn how social media can benefit a company or an organization from the amount of customer engagement on their platforms, as well as positive reviews. 

From this project, you will learn how to be familiar with social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube, understand how Edoofa’s social media is built, network and build a connection with other students around the world, and much more!

The scholarship credits that you can earn from this project are a total of $20, which you will get when you complete each and every task every day successfully. In the worst-case scenario, if you are not able to complete the task given to you before the deadline due to *a genuine* reason, you will *only* be given the credits for the tasks you have accomplished, so make sure not to miss out on any task to attain the maximum credits from this project.

Duration of project: 1 month

Please let me know if you are available for a month or not?
Do you have a stable internet connection?
Also, do you have social media handles [Instagram + Facebook] ?

13/02/23, 19:17 - Jasmine Kaur: One morning, an elderly man was walking along the beach when he noticed a young boy picking something off the sand and throwing it into the sea.

As he got closer, the man realized the child was throwing stranded starfishes that had washed up on the shore back into the breaking waves.

Approaching the boy, the man asked what he was doing.

“The starfish will die if they’re still on the shore when the sun rises,” he replied.

Perplexed, the old man said, “But that’s pointless! There are countless miles of beach and thousands of starfish. It doesn’t matter how many you return to the water, you can’t make a difference.”

Unfazed, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish, and tossed it into the sea.

“It matters to this one,” he said.","transform":"

06/03/23, 21:27 - Jasmine Kaur: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”
