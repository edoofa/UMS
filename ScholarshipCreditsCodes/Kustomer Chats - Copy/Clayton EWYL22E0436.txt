07/08/22, 04:39 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.

08/08/22, 19:02 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my proud EDOOFIAN!‚≠ê
How did your weekend go?
I know we have both been connected in the EWYL Journey for a long time now and I very well know how dedicatedly and consistently you work and make every session's discussion very productive and interactive. 
This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

SESSIONS' DAYS- I know you are very well aware that your sessions are scheduled on MONDAY and THURSDAY on the EWYL Line from 01:00-02:30 PM

MISSED SESSION- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday.In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday. 
Sessions will be held only on the EWYL Line.
Keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line.
In cases where you are not able to attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
Hoping for an amazing week with you.?
08/08/22, 22:29 - Clayton EWYL22E0436: My day is going well how is yours?
08/08/22, 22:29 - Clayton EWYL22E0436: Okay I understand
08/08/22, 22:33 - Saloni Rastogi: My day is also going great, thanks for asking.
08/08/22, 22:33 - Saloni Rastogi: One can be called successful if they have achieved their desired goals. For some people, being successful means being rich. But being successful is even more than being rich. When you achieve what you want, it gives you immense pleasure, and that is incomparable with being rich. To be successful in any aspect of life, one needs to have strong dedication and work hard. 
Our WEEKEND ACTIVITY discussed the traits of a successful person.
So, in our session today, we will:
1. discuss your understanding of the weekend activity.
2. make weekly plans on achieving targets on three ongoing projects.
08/08/22, 22:37 - Clayton EWYL22E0436: Okay i understand we may proceed
08/08/22, 22:54 - Saloni Rastogi: Please share your understanding Clayton.

16/08/22, 09:05 - Clayton EWYL22E0436: Greetings, I hope you are doing well. 

1. Among the 3 mantras, the one that best suits my personality would be the first one, about forgetting luck and living by intent. The reason is that I'm a person who tries by all means to live my life according to plan. I the kind of person who plans every single step of my day, every day of the week. This helps me to manage my time well and I live with less pressure.

Secondly, a success habit I would like to develop and master is stopping fixating on failure. Taking failure as a lesson is good thing. Experience does not mean one is perfect but it is what brings perfection, so I want to learn to embrace my failures so as to learn more from them and to ensure I'll never lead myself down that same path again.

Thirdly, I have previously mentioned during my counselling sessions that my role model is my aunt who is a nurse right now. From her I have learnt a lot. The success behaviour I admire the most from her is consistence. I have learnt that focusing on my goals and always aiming at them will bring success more easily. Being consistent requires passion and intention in everything

20/08/22, 22:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Clayton!
How are you?
20/08/22, 22:19 - Saloni Rastogi: I am so happy to see you following the daily ritual with so much enthusiasm and excitement.
20/08/22, 22:21 - Saloni Rastogi: I am so happy to hear your thoughts on Wednesday's lesson and I would love to see how you implement this in your personal life.
We must know why is a Personal Brand Statement Important.
- For networking, job searches, and overall career development, having a personal brand statement provides a lot of benefits. People will search for you online and check out your reputation when they are evaluating whether to hire you or partner with you.

- Your brand statement is the first thing that people will associate with you so you want to start on the right foot.

- A strong personal brand can open up doors to speaking engagements, job interviews, promotions, client relationships, and overall business success.
20/08/22, 22:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this Clayton, I would like to share something with you. For all my students I am maintaining a personal report card so that each week I can give them a reflection on how they have performed, how many sessions have they attended, and how many responses have they submitted.
Please have a look at it, go through it, and share with me what can be done about it and how should we proceed.
I hope I am clear.
I am always there for all kinds of help, but yes, we need to work on this.
20/08/22, 22:27 - Clayton EWYL22E0436: I'm well, how are you?
20/08/22, 22:29 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing great Clayton, thanks for asking.

23/08/22, 07:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Your attendance at the webinar with Mr. Simon Maingi was greatly appreciated. You certainly had a lot of information to take in. Many kids attended, and the majority of them spoke with Mr. Simon personally to discover the value of developing a \"YOU\" brand. 

There is clearly room for improvement in terms of asking the correct questions, proper webcam etiquette, and engagement, all of which will be the subject of numerous talks going forward.

In the interim, we've provided a link to the session's feedback form. Your truthful feedback will enable us to contact the industry experts of your choosing and publish more success stories that will enable you to develop your skill set and advance your career.

The three said sharing their stories should inspire youths to work hard toward achieving their goals and shun a life of drugs.
This lesson was something that added so much to my knowledge and yes, took me one step ahead in this stage of learning:
So in our session today, we will:
1. talk about how these three brains inspired you
2. discussion on the community building project ( I will share audio and form with you, go through it, and then we will discuss)
3. sharing opinions on the weekend activity

25/08/22, 20:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, I read your form response and I am very happy to see how freely and openly you have expressed your thoughts.
25/08/22, 20:03 - Saloni Rastogi: I want to discuss a few things.
First, you said you are missing out on teamwork skills. So I want to ask have you ever worked in a team? If yes, then what was your experience?
25/08/22, 20:04 - Clayton EWYL22E0436: Thank you
25/08/22, 20:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Secondly, you wrote that 'being organized, time management, hard work, and consistency are usually the skills that get me through most obstacles.'. Can you share such instance where you have done that?
25/08/22, 20:04 - Clayton EWYL22E0436: So shall I wait on listening to the audio
25/08/22, 20:05 - Saloni Rastogi: No, listen it and then we will discuss it in our session today.
25/08/22, 20:05 - Clayton EWYL22E0436: Okay
25/08/22, 20:08 - Clayton EWYL22E0436: Yes I have worked in a team but very few times. The experience wasn't that much captivating and maybe it's because I worked with people who didn't put much effort into the work we did so I developed sort of an attitude towards working in groups.
25/08/22, 20:24 - Clayton EWYL22E0436: Such instances usually occur during exams. Like fir example last month towards exams we were also given CALAs (Continuous Assessment Learner Activities) which were also due that same time so I had to manage these extra assignments and studying for my exams.
