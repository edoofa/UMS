As we approach the upcoming exam period, it is crucial to ensure that you are well-prepared not only academically but also in terms of time management and maintaining effective communication with your mentors. To facilitate this process, we kindly request all students to submit their time management strategies and plans for maintaining constant communication with mentors during the exam period.
Your submitted strategies will not only help you stay on track during the exam period but also enable your mentors to provide you with the support and guidance you need.
We appreciate your proactive approach to effective time management and mentor communication during this crucial time. Your success is our priority, and we are here to support you every step of the way.

Best regards,

Hope you are doing well!
19/08/22, 18:06 - PATIENCE EWYL22E0439: Am doing well how are you
19/08/22, 18:26 - Jasmine Kaur: Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times pere week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you s
19/08/22, 18:48 - PATIENCE EWYL22E0439: I am a proud Edoofian
19/08/22, 18:50 - Jasmine Kaur: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

I wanted to get in touch with you to share your EWYL report card and ask you to evaluate your performance by responding to the following questions:

1. How would you rate your performance from 1-10, 10 being the highest score?
2. What is your goal- in terms of skills and amount of scholarship credits that you want to earn?
3. What is your plan- how will you achieve the above mentioned goal?

The answers you give here will be evaluated by Ms Deepali and Ms Davi. So take you time and share your responses here in the group itself.

17/12/22, 20:56 - PATIENCE EWYL22E0439: My next step is to seek assistance and advices from other people especially my elders, ad I should be confident when doing it.
17/12/22, 20:56 - PATIENCE EWYL22E0439: Good day ma'am
17/12/22, 21:16 - Jasmine Kaur: I will help you with some tips:
1. Have a plan
Set goals at the beginning of the project and note the date. Have a deadline for it as well, it is good to manage the goals. Decide at the beginning how often you are going to work on the project.

2. Listen and listen
Listening in my opinion is more important than saying anything. Listen to the other person's problems and just by being there you might help the other person to think out loud and share their thoughts with you [ in reference to school headmasters and other students ].



3. Make time
Being a hardworking person is not easy, it consumes time, not only from the meetings but you need to prepare and do some research before every meeting. Be prepared to spend some time on this.

4. Be honest
If people ask you a question and you don‚Äôt know the answer, be honest, don‚Äôt make up an answer just to show that you are never wrong.You don‚Äôt have all the answers in the world. If you don‚Äôt know the answer for a problem, look for it, or even better, look for it together with your mentor.

The holiday season is upon us and it‚Äôs time to light up the Christmas trees and indulge ourselves in the festivities. I assume due to the Christmas and New year seasons everyone is in a buoyant mood?

 Well, then I implore you to avail this time to spend with your family and friends. We are announcing holidays from tomorrow, 24th December 2022 to till 1st January 2023. You are required to report on 2nd January 2023.
Go out with friends to parties, eat with no concern, go to a church or set up Christmas at your home. Have a Christmas and New Year of your desire. Then come back with much more energy as your EWYL team has planned a very fruitful year ahead of you.

Many more projects, more skills to master, more exposure to new companies, more knowledge, and more surprises.

 Are you excited? Well, let the passion in you burn as we are waiting for you to come back stronger. Let‚Äôs make a new resolution to new ventures with discoveries that are waiting to happen.

 Happy Holidays,

08/01/23, 01:53 - Jasmine Kaur: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up.

Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

09/01/23, 19:24 - Jasmine Kaur: Good day my proud edoofian,
How are you doing today?
I am sure you had a lot of fun on NYE.

Let us start our day with a beautiful quote  need to accept that we won‚Äôt always make the right decisions, that we‚Äôll screw up royally sometimes‚Äïunderstanding that failure is not the opposite of success, it‚Äôs part of success.

I feel we have missed a lot due to the holiday season so we will be having a detailed session today, you are suggested to be *active* to avoid any delays.
09/01/23, 21:49 - PATIENCE EWYL22E0439: I'm doing well ma'am
09/01/23, 21:49 - PATIENCE EWYL22E0439: Thank you for the quote
09/01/23, 23:26 - Jasmine Kaur: Let us start with attempting your weekend Activity : 

\"Sell me this pen.\" That might just be the best sales one-liner in history.

Over the last 10 years, I've seen many sales leaders use this question as part of their interview process to whittle out the \"can-dos\" from the \"can-nots.\" 

It's a favorite amongst sales professionals, from used car salespeople to Wall Street wolves. And for good reason ‚Äî it's an exciting, accessible way to test a salesperson's fundamentals. How someone responds to those four words can tell you a lot about how ‚Äî and how well ‚Äî a candidate is going to perform in his\/her job. 

Let's try to respond to this prominent question as part of weekend submission. Your response must be shared in at least 150 words. The submission deadline for the same is *09\/01 time : till 3 pm today*.
I'm anticipating a highly original and creative response from your end.
10/01/23, 01:04 - PATIENCE EWYL22E0439: Am failing to come up with the ideas of selling it
10/01/23, 05:30 - Jasmine Kaur: You can think of them by tomorrow 10 am Patience and then I will guide you further in tomorrow's session.
10/01/23, 06:01 - PATIENCE EWYL22E0439: Okay
10/01/23, 18:33 - PATIENCE EWYL22E0439: Good morning Ms Riva
10/01/23, 18:35 - PATIENCE EWYL22E0439: Good morning Ms Riva
10/01/23, 18:35 - PATIENCE EWYL22E0439: I'm a proud Edoofian
10/01/23, 18:35 - PATIENCE EWYL22E0439: I managed to raise a few ideas on how to sell the pen
10/01/23, 18:35 - PATIENCE EWYL22E0439: When was the last time you bought a pen?
Was it for business use or personal use?
What kind of pen do you typically buy?
Do you really like nice pens?
What is the most you've ever spent on a pen? If it's less than USD$5.00 then we might have a problem because the pen that am holding cost about USD$5.00.
You might think I'm insane to charge USD$5.00 on a single pen, but you're absolutely right because most people don't understand the value of this pen. This pen was once used by one buffer to sign very important documents in his carrier. This pen is full of history. This is a pen for a man who wants to share incredible stories with his colleagues. Is that you? 
But you would spend USD$5.00 on a single pen, would you?
If you would, then the pen all yours, Congratulations.
