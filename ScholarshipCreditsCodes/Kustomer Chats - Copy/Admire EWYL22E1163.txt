Here's a festive riddle to spark curiosity: What do you get if you cross a snowman and a vampire?

Excited to reveal the answer and dive into our discussion!
19/12/23, 15:54 - Admire EWYL22E1163: üòÅüòÅI don't have any idea about that riddle
May you enlighten me
19/12/23, 15:56 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, the answer is a Frostbiteü•∂
19/12/23, 15:57 - Admire EWYL22E1163: Wow I didn't even have any idea
19/12/23, 16:03 - Aditi Kapoor: Let's begin with your wonderful story as per the Saturday Activity.
19/12/23, 16:04 - Admire EWYL22E1163: Okay let's move on
19/12/23, 16:08 - Aditi Kapoor: I am waiting for your story.
19/12/23, 16:19 - Admire EWYL22E1163: On Saturday we discussed a couple of issues which are honesty and hard work. We did not discussed anything more except their importance.
You were only commenting on me on how I understood them.
19/12/23, 16:21 - Aditi Kapoor: Please scroll up and see I shared an exciting Saturday activity
19/12/23, 16:21 - Admire EWYL22E1163: Yes this one
19/12/23, 16:23 - Aditi Kapoor: So I am waiting for your story, Admire.
19/12/23, 16:50 - Admire EWYL22E1163: Years ago in my community, there was a father of three sons who was seriously sick, who made many of us, children to be honest and try to work hard. Before his death he told  his three sons that when I built this house I had a lot of money. I dug a hole under the foundation of my house and placed a suitcase in the hole. He said the suitcase has a plenty of money in it. The father didn't live more even for a day, he died.
Just after their father's funeral they dug and destroyed the house. They then searched for the suitcase quickly. These three sons were very happy to find their suitcase.
Unfortunately, the elder son holding the suitcase he just showed some sad facial expressions. This shocked the other two. They find out that there was no money even a dollar to buy water to remove thirstüò≠. They opened it and find a short letter saying, Learn to be honesty and work hard
19/12/23, 16:54 - Aditi Kapoor: This is a profound and touching story that underscores the importance of honesty and hard work. It serves as a powerful reminder that the true wealth we inherit from our parents goes beyond material possessions. The father's message, though not accompanied by monetary riches, contained a treasure trove of values that are invaluable in life.
It's a tale of moral wealth, emphasizing that the virtues of honesty and hard work are more enduring and rewarding than any material possession. The disappointment faced by the sons becomes a poignant lesson about the true meaning of wealth and success.
In our own journeys, it's crucial to recognize that the virtues instilled in us by our parents, mentors, and communities are the real foundation for a prosperous and fulfilling life. This story beautifully encapsulates the timeless wisdom that being honest and working hard are the keys to true wealth, not just for ourselves but for the betterment of our communities and society at large.
19/12/23, 17:01 - Aditi Kapoor: We're concluding today's session, and I look forward to picking up in our next session with this fantastic energy! üöÄ
19/12/23, 17:16 - Admire EWYL22E1163: Yes hard working brings us our own wealth
19/12/23, 17:16 - Admire EWYL22E1163: Being honesty is the key to success since promotions can be attained
19/12/23, 17:17 - Admire EWYL22E1163: Thank you so much for the session
I like you. Have a great day ahead
20/12/23, 14:35 - Aditi Kapoor: Happy Wednesday‚ú®
üöÄ Brace yourself for a lesson sprinkled with knowledge and a dash of holiday cheer! üéÑüéÅ
