20/07/22, 01:34 - Aditi Kapoor: Its that time of the week, when you are required to wear your thinking caps and get your tools ready to research and learn! From our Wednesday Wisdom, we learnt how Patrice Motsepe, became successful by making the best of the opportunity very few could see, the strong potential in the mining industry. As part of your Saturday Activity you are required to share a detailed submission on the fast growing industry\/sector\/business in your country. Don’t forget to add a SWOT analysis and the predictions on the future performance of the same.

20/07/22, 01:56 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: Understood
20/07/22, 02:07 - Aditi Kapoor: SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. It is sometimes called situational assessment or situational analysis.

20/07/22, 05:22 - Aditi Kapoor: Please share your response before 12 PM tomorrow.
20/07/22, 15:34 - Aditi Kapoor: Good morning Chilongezyo!
How did your day go?
20/07/22, 15:35 - Aditi Kapoor: I am so happy that you have a good understanding of who a proud edoofian is and what it denotes.
20/07/22, 15:36 - Aditi Kapoor: In today's session we will discuss your response to the weekend activity and how we have to go about the projects that we recently finished discussing.
20/07/22, 18:17 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: I'm  doing  very fine thank you
20/07/22, 18:18 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: I'm  doing  very fine thank you
20/07/22, 18:19 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: Got it.
20/07/22, 19:39 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: The fast growing sector\/Industry\/business  in my country

It was the past, it is the present and it is still going to be the future. The agricultural  sector has been a fast growing sector in my country. Due to my country being  on the very top of the developing  countries it has been on the vague of high increase in population  hence the high demand of the growth of Agriculture. This has been highly considered  as a traditional  practice  however now it has developed  into business  itself hence the introduction  of more Agribusiness  activities. This business has the very best strength as it is a business  which is need threatened  by time as there will be it's  need nomatter the time in the future hence it's  the future.

Zimbabwe as it was under colonisation, most of the Agricultural  outputs  where produced by the foreigners  who had the ability to do the large scale type of Agriculture, however due to resettlement  there the high production decreased and the food security of the country decreased. This decrease in the food security is a guarantee  for the need of the growth of the Agricultural  sector in the country. The ability to see this  market of Agriculture  may lead to high success as said that this type of business  is thee future  agricultural  products will always be needed in the future as they are surely at our daily need or they are actually  some necessities.

There are though few weakness in this sector  however if high inspected for someone to conduct  this type of business there is the need of high amounts of capital to acquire the land, inputs and the machinery  the is used in the bussiness. It also needs time investment  into learning the type of Agriculture  to be practised. Choice is also another weakness which affect this type of industry as people tend to lack the cost benefit analysis  of choosing  the right crop or the right type of Agriculture  to be done. It is also a highly volatile business  where kne can make la
20/07/22, 20:45 - Aditi Kapoor: I read your response Chilongezyo and it made me so inquisitive to know more about agriculture in Zimbabwe look what I found  in Zimbabwe is overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture. Agriculture accounts for 18% of Zimbabwe's GDP as of 2015. Agriculture enabled people to produce surplus food. There are different crops that farmers grow and some of these include, maize, sorghum, rapoko, groundnuts, round-nuts, and beans.
Your response reflects clarity in the way you have expressed and so thoughtfully you have penned down your thoughts.
20/07/22, 20:49 - Aditi Kapoor: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader. 
Also NAME, along with the SWOT analysis of a company, I would appreciate it if you also share a SWOT analysis of yourself. I want to see how much more you have learned beyond this activity.
20/07/22, 20:55 - Aditi Kapoor: Chilongezyo*
20/07/22, 20:57 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: Thank you i have also learn to add more details  next time.
20/07/22, 21:00 - Aditi Kapoor: Please share your own SWOT Chilongezyo.
After that we will discuss about projects.
20/07/22, 21:02 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: Okay i will in a few minutes  I'm  still doing  one.
20/07/22, 21:27 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: Tanganda Tea Company located in a city known as Mutare in zimbabwe is an agricultural  company  which produces high amount of tea and coffee.This as an Agricultural  company  has confidence  in its service  that its going  to be a long lasting one due to their products which will remain  of the vital need in the this and the upcoming  generations.

Tea is in its  highest demands in Zimbabwe due to the Zimbabwe Christian  Church followers who value it as they believe it's  highly recommended  for the cleansing of the body hence this company has it's  strength in the factors  mentioned.

 However on the other hand there are a number of weaknesses  in this business  as at some point the consumption  of high caffeine  products is highly encouraged  against  by most doctors. As we approach  a world which value health their product is likely  to collapse. This business  also use large land and causes high pollution  which most Geographers are against

The companies  have identified  some opportunities  of growth of their  service as the country is still developing  hence there  are high opportunities  considering  that there is less competition  on the market and also there are opportunities  of cheap labour and higher pocketing  to the company.

The threats that  the company may likely to face is that Zimbabwe is at it's  peak of high importation  because  of expensive  production in the country hence Tanganda Tea is likely to be threatened  by the foreign market which is getting  into the country.
21/07/22, 04:57 - Aditi Kapoor: Chilongezyo you have submitted a SWOT analysis of another industry. I well appreciate your efforts and response but I asked you to submit a SWOT analysis of yourself.
21/07/22, 23:57 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: Sorry for not getting  that i will do a SWOT analysis  of myself
22/07/22, 05:20 - Aditi Kapoor: Please do that now, don't worry.
22/07/22, 20:39 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: I am a 20 year old young man. I am a well trained  public speakers  who has very have the ability  to address a large number of people. I'm  also very friendly  indeed as i easily adapt to my peer as well as being  supportive in terms  of motivational speaking.

As a human being  i have my weaknesses. One of my worst weaknesses  is failure  where it pulls me down a lot whenever  i fail  something  i really  needed. I also have some few social weaknesses  which greatly  deteriorate my posture and wellbeing.

I am someone who highly  utilizes opportunities  which come in my way by working  hard onto something  i need to achieve.

22/07/22, 23:26 - Aditi Kapoor: I am so happy to see your SWOT analysis. I am glad that you have recognized your weaknesses and are ready to work on them, that's the trait of a good leader.
23/07/22, 01:54 - Aditi Kapoor: Along with this, let's move on with our session.
Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our WEDNESDAY Wisdom was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on community building project
25/07/22, 03:18 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
25/07/22, 15:23 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: I am a proud Edoofian
25/07/22, 15:25 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride.

25/07/22, 15:34 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: Very true indeed.  They don't  blame the world they learn from their mistakes and correct  them. I can also acknowledge  those who came up with the most  admired inventories  in the world they failed a number of times and kept on correcting  their mistkes until they attained  greatness. That's  a really good lesson  for me.
26/07/22, 23:21 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

Yesterday I had an amazing day. I went to the airport to receive all my proud Edoofians and I had tears in my eyes seeing their happiness and enthusiasm. I want you to look at it and share your thoughts with me.
26/07/22, 23:23 - Aditi Kapoor: I read your response to the Wednesday wisdom Chilongezyo and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
26/07/22, 23:24 - Aditi Kapoor: Along with this, we can have our session:
''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''

The weekend activity clearly talked about what are the growing mindsets of successful people. 
I would really appreciate it if you share your understanding with me on the same and what you think can take you to the top.
26/07/22, 23:35 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: There are certain  steps  and ways that one has to follow so as to  achieve success. These are sometimes  called billionaire  mindset as they are believed to be ways which can make one have a focused  mindset that has goals and it knows it's  worth.

Successful  people are believed  to have a routine  in their life. A routine  that comprises  of their daily activities including  the little things that you can imagine. The successful  people have a scheduled  time for sleeping  and also time to wake up, exercise  to keep the best posture and to even study and read so as to learn new things in life. They are people who love interacting  with different  people learning from other's  experiences.

I have taken it a responsibility  upon myself  to act accordingly. So as to develop the same mindset i would want to be someone  who listens carefully  to what other's  say and be analytic enough with what i say. Also to develop the following  mindset one has to associate  with people who possess  it hence i am will to associate  with such.
26/07/22, 23:42 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: Wow this is so amazing
26/07/22, 23:44 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: I have shared my understanding there.
26/07/22, 23:57 - Aditi Kapoor: Indeed it was an outstanding experience.
26/07/22, 23:57 - Aditi Kapoor: I read your understanding of the weekend activity and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it’s not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you’re looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don’t do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.
27/07/22, 00:07 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: True i understand  and learn more from that
27/07/22, 05:05 - Aditi Kapoor: So Chilongezyo, I am waiting for the forms from your side under the community building project as we talked about it in the last week.
27/07/22, 16:06 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: I am a proud Edoofian
27/07/22, 16:07 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation.

Please let me know in case of any queries.
The deadline was today at 10 AM but still no acknowledgment I have received yet from your side.
29/07/22, 23:15 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: 1. Of later many  institutes  and  people have been engaging  into a number of researches on how to solve this problem of hairfall which mainly experienced by many and a small number of people. Hence this high rate of research have led to many companies  and people claiming  that they have a solution  to this problem. Yes some are so successful  in it due to their professional  research and the zeal to provide  the people with  the right product. On the other hand due to the need for money some have been supplying  some remedies which are far from being good.

I have come in contact with so far the product  i consider to of my list in terms of solving  this hair fall problem. It is a SesaCare product known as Support and Anti-Hair Fall Combo. This i assure you that it will perfectly  secure you hair and support your hair to withstand  this virtal stage at which it will be encountering.  SesaCare is a huge company  and it specialises  in the field of providing  you  with the solutions to you problem.
29/07/22, 23:16 - Chilongezyo EWYL22E0369: 2. This seems  impossible  to have your hair regrow after the hair fallout. There are many specialists in the hair products who are providing  the solutions to this. Hair falling out is when the hair cells become too old to grow. This is mainly common  in different  types of people. 

There have been some  different hair growth products which have been produced so as to renew the hair cells of some individuals. Due to this course someone who has the hair fallout  problem can take these and renew their hair cells.
