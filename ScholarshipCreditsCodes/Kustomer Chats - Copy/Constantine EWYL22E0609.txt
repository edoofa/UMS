23/12/22, 23:01 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

04/01/23, 23:08 - Unknown: *Wednesday Lesson | 4 Jan*

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy learning.

04/01/23, 23:13 - Constantine EWYL22E0609: I am going through the pdf now
04/01/23, 23:30 - Constantine EWYL22E0609: Gone through the pdf and it was highlighting the six principles of persuasion like reciprocity whereby it was mentioning how one needs to act first before the other because people tend to feel as if they owe to people when someone does something kind therefore one needs to act first....be it kindness, sharing and caring

The next one was scarcity.....the less something there is the more people tend to want it....therefore  one has to create a sense of scarcity around our own availability 

The third one was authority....building trust and creditability is very important but one can also build some sense of authority through recommendations.....

The fourth was commitment and consistency.....one has to be committed to whatever he or she is doing and there should be a consistency that creates trust with the peers around you or even external peers

The 5th one was liking....one has to simply be liked by those around you rather than those from afar....it creates a bond and it helps as a backbone


The last one was consensus whereby it was mentioning about social groups and these may help in decision making

05/01/23, 21:08 - Constantine EWYL22E0609: I am going to act first by introducing the Edoofa scholarships in schools.....for scholarships are scarce it is going to be a good offer for students who would want to look for university places after their exams and l would be committed to do the EWYL project and to truly convince others to join the Edoofa scholarships and l would look for help from my peers in terms of decision making
