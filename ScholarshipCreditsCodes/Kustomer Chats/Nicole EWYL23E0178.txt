02/12/23, 16:43 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL

Hope you are well.

Please share your understanding in the text form as it is to be submitted.
08/12/23, 00:26 - Nicole EWYL23E0178: ouky so l was saying the spirit of competition carries with it both merits and demerits but l would say it is advantageous to a greater extent for example where the spirit of competition played a pivotal role in my life is when l was in form four l had a best friend named Nokutenda who used to compete with me in my studies at first l hated it but l latter realised it was helping me as l worked hard not to be beaten by him so whenever we wrote tests l read with a motive to be above him so this competition helped as l excelled in my studies and my grades increased hence making me pass so the spirit of competition is good however to a lesser extent it is not good as it leads to jealous which is not a good thing so if competition becomes full of jealous that's where it brings demerits as jealous can make one to bad things so me l would say jealousy is good to a larger extent
08/12/23, 13:06 - Aditi Kapoor: Happy Fridayüåü
Hope you are well.

Let's begin today's amazing session!
08/12/23, 13:28 - Aditi Kapoor: Nicole, the last lesson was on Microsoft Excel and not spirit of competition.

08/12/23, 19:50 - Nicole EWYL23E0178: my understandings on excel are that Microsoft excel spreadsheet is very helpful in various areas in business or academia it increases productivity in handling large amounts of data it has also a room to creat graphs and chats for easy analisation of data and can also help enhance the presentation excel also helps one have problem solving skills and enhance also logical thinking excel has also formulas to help one when working with it
08/12/23, 19:50 - Nicole EWYL23E0178: the community building project is going well l have managed to talk to a number of schools in my sarrounding but my big challenge is the fees of the schools is less than $100
08/12/23, 20:10 - Aditi Kapoor: Your understanding of Excel is absolutely on point! Microsoft Excel indeed serves as a powerful spreadsheet tool with wide-ranging applications in both business and academia. Its ability to enhance productivity in managing substantial amounts of data is a key feature, and the capability to create graphs and charts contributes to easier data analysis and improved presentations. It's great that you highlighted how Excel goes beyond data management, fostering problem-solving skills and logical thinking, especially through its formulas.

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!
