09/05/23, 14:03 - Unknown: Once you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner.

09/05/23, 14:04 - Unknown: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

I definitely will
09/05/23, 14:09 - Unknown: So, This is what the First message should look like:

09/05/23, 14:19 - Unknown: (Over the past 5 years, after counselling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organisation wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. With the quality of education provided to the student completing high school, edoofa would want to transform your school’s every student into a person who’s so strong in the knowledge that he/she becomes better than his/her peers. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development/growth.)
