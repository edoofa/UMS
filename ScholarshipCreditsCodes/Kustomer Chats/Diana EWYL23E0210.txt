01/12/23, 15:50 - Ananya: Good morning and happy new month, Diana! üåû‚ú®

As we kick off our session today, let's start with a question: What exciting plans do you have for this month? Whether it's academic goals, personal projects, or anything else, I'm here to support you. Let's make December a month of growth and achievement! üöÄüìö
01/12/23, 15:51 - Diana EWYL23E0210: Thank you so much
01/12/23, 15:51 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
01/12/23, 15:53 - Diana EWYL23E0210: December naturally goes with a lot of plans ,l mean it's the festive season ,time for outings ,camps and vacations
01/12/23, 15:53 - Diana EWYL23E0210: Noted and l cannot wait to enjoy this journey
01/12/23, 15:54 - Ananya: Well, that's lovely! I am sure you are going to celebrate Christmas this month, right?
01/12/23, 15:55 - Diana EWYL23E0210: Yes christmas and many more
01/12/23, 15:56 - Ananya: Lovely! Now, I believe that we should start with something that aligns with your interests. So, would you like to tell me which one is your favorite project: the community building or the schools connect?
01/12/23, 15:58 - Diana EWYL23E0210: It's actually the community building project for me because l get to interact with others and show off about the edoofa programme and how it can greatly change your life ,the interactions helps to improve yourself socially as well
01/12/23, 15:59 - Ananya: Well, that's great! May I ask about your progress in that project so far?
01/12/23, 16:15 - Diana EWYL23E0210: I have given out 3 applications so far and I'm waiting for them to send back filled out
01/12/23, 16:15 - Diana EWYL23E0210: I apologize for my network is down
01/12/23, 16:15 - Ananya: Alright, should I share an incredible idea for finding more potential students?
01/12/23, 16:16 - Diana EWYL23E0210: Yes please
01/12/23, 16:17 - Ananya: You know, one of my students' friends is studying in a different school. She has actually joined their WhatsApp class groups and is now communicating with them. Not only that, since she is connected with students from various schools, she is also obtaining the contact information of school administrators. This way, she is working on two separate projects simultaneously.
Don't you think it is an amazing idea?
01/12/23, 16:21 - Diana EWYL23E0210: That is a great idea  l should try to do that also
01/12/23, 16:22 - Ananya: Absolutely, Diana! Also, in addition to the resources we already have in our EWYL group, I was thinking of sharing a few more with you. This way, you can then pass them along to your students and school heads.
01/12/23, 16:26 - Diana EWYL23E0210: Ok you can send thank you
01/12/23, 16:27 - Ananya: You can also share our Edoofa Instagram page.
Additionally, did you know that the First Lady of Zimbabwe took time during her visit to India to meet the CEO of Edoofa? How can this be a fraud?
Moreover, did you know that Edoofa was one of the official sponsors of the NSQC event this year?
01/12/23, 16:28 - Ananya: .
01/12/23, 16:28 - Ananya: .
01/12/23, 16:35 - Diana EWYL23E0210: That is a valid point

01/12/23, 16:36 - Ananya: Keeping our today's session short, let us connect in our next session. Let's end the session with a smile: Why did the bicycle fall over?

Because it was two-tired! üòÑ
01/12/23, 16:36 - Diana EWYL23E0210: üòÖ what a joke

05/12/23, 15:39 - Ananya: Good afternoon, Diana!

Here's a fun and easy fact to brighten your day: Honeybees can recognize human faces! These tiny creatures have an amazing ability to remember and distinguish between different human faces. So, the next time you see a bee buzzing around, maybe it's just saying, "Hello!"üêù

05/12/23, 15:42 - Ananya: Haha, why Diana! Do I look like a bee?üòÖ
05/12/23, 15:43 - Diana EWYL23E0210: üòÖmy apologies for any misunderstandings
05/12/23, 15:57 - Ananya: Well, you have missed your Saturday activity! I hope you understand that each and every activity is recorded to track your progress and regularity in your EWYL sessions. A significant gap in your Saturday activity can have a negative impact.
05/12/23, 16:00 - Diana EWYL23E0210: I was not aware of the Saturday lesson ,l thought it was Tuesday and Friday only
05/12/23, 16:07 - Ananya: On Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday
05/12/23, 16:08 - Diana EWYL23E0210: Ok l have understood
05/12/23, 16:11 - Ananya: Well, that's alright! So Diana may I ask if you tried the tips and tricks I shared with you in our last session?

05/12/23, 16:27 - Ananya: No, that's alright! Now may I ask if you were able to get in touch with your school head?
05/12/23, 16:30 - Diana EWYL23E0210: Not yet but soon
05/12/23, 16:33 - Ananya: Alright, now for a start, I am thinking of setting a small target for you today. I want you to connect with at least 2 students and submit their application forms to me by tomorrow evening!
05/12/23, 16:38 - Diana EWYL23E0210: Alright
05/12/23, 16:40 - Ananya: Let me help you with how can you connect with the students!
05/12/23, 16:40 - Ananya: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
05/12/23, 16:40 - Ananya: *Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
05/12/23, 16:45 - Diana EWYL23E0210: I will definitely try all these methods
05/12/23, 16:49 - Ananya: Great! Since our session time is over, I wish you all the very best for your target. I am sharing our weekly newsletter with you, so get ready to be inspired!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Wednesday lesson is going to be particularly valuable for you as we delve into the major importance of using Excel sheets and explore a few basic formulas that will be immensely beneficial for your academic journey.

In today's lesson, we will highlight how Excel can serve as an indispensable tool for students. From organizing your academic life to enhancing your analytical skills, Excel offers a range of features that can significantly impact your efficiency and productivity.

09/12/23, 18:44 - Ananya: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

12/12/23, 15:38 - Ananya: Good afternoon, Diana!

Did you know octopuses have three hearts and blue blood? Two pumps to the gills, and one to the body. They're basically the rockstars of the ocean with a unique sense of style! Now, let's dive into our session with that octopus energy!üêô

12/12/23, 15:44 - Diana EWYL23E0210: Ok let me see
12/12/23, 15:45 - Ananya: Well, I want to share something with you. Over the weekend, I was working with my students' credits! It seems like my students are back with so much excitement. I am so happy with their work‚Äîeverybody is active while working on their projects. Many of my students are earning credits, and I am sure they will return to India with many credits in their accounts!
12/12/23, 15:47 - Diana EWYL23E0210: Return to India ,,,does it mean they are on holiday
12/12/23, 15:47 - Diana EWYL23E0210: That's amazing I'm sure they feel proud of themselves to have earned such credits
12/12/23, 15:52 - Diana EWYL23E0210: Like this or
12/12/23, 15:54 - Ananya: Yes, just like this!
12/12/23, 15:56 - Diana EWYL23E0210: So l have to make a list of my daily activities for this week and the send you back on our Wednesday lesson

12/12/23, 16:15 - Ananya: Well, I want to share something with you. Over the weekend, I was working with my students' credits! It seems like my students are back with so much excitement. I am so happy with their work‚Äîeverybody is active while working on their projects. Many of my students are earning credits, and I am sure they will come to India with many credits in their accounts!
12/12/23, 16:15 - Ananya: Now, 2023 is wrapping up. Don't you think we should kick off the new year with something big? How about committing to earning a specific amount of scholarship credits?

After all, you wouldn't want to head to India empty-handed.
I'm saying this from my own experience ‚Äì having some credits before you arrive in India isn't just a benefit for you; it's a help for your parents too. Not only this, we often pick students for internships and personal training based on their credits and regularity in the EWYL journey.

Believe me, you've got plenty of time right now being in your home country, so don;t you think we should utilise this time with our utmost dedication?

12/12/23, 16:16 - Diana EWYL23E0210: That is amazing

12/12/23, 16:20 - Ananya: Great, so I have finalized a few of my students for a 30-day challenge. During this duration I want you to dedicatedly attend the sessions and work hard on your EWYL Projects.

Not only this, I will set a target for you and you have to commit to work hard to achieve those targets. Being your mentor I will be there to help you in each process. I that alright?
12/12/23, 16:22 - Diana EWYL23E0210: That is  alright , noted
12/12/23, 16:27 - Ananya: Amazing! Let's set a new target for you. For the first 10 days out of the 30, I want you to focus on connecting with two schools and getting eight students to submit their offline application forms.

If you encounter any challenges during this time, reach out to me immediately because we need to achieve this target. I expect you to give it your best effort.
19/09/23, 18:01 - Diana EWYL23E0210: Greetings Ms. Ananya, I am Diana and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Diana EWYL23E0210
18/11/23, 16:15 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
