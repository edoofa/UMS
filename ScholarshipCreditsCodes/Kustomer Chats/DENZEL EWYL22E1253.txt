14/03/23, 19:14 - DENZEL EWYL22E1253: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Denzel Andile Gadzayi and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is DENZEL EWYL22E1253
14/03/23, 19:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Denzel!
How are you?
14/03/23, 19:25 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
14/03/23, 19:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
14/03/23, 19:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
14/03/23, 19:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
14/03/23, 19:27 - DENZEL EWYL22E1253: I am good ma'am
14/03/23, 19:28 - DENZEL EWYL22E1253: Noted, yes i am ready ma'am

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

21/03/23, 21:32 - Saloni Rastogi: Moving towards your projects.
 Proud Edoofian, TODAY, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
21/03/23, 21:32 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him\/her for your School Head’s Contact.
22/03/23, 00:11 - DENZEL EWYL22E1253: Ok ma'am but i cannot provide the number today ,but if you give me time i will get the contact number of the school head

During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

How are you?

As informed earlier, I was not available last week from Thursday to Friday and the organization was closed on Saturday and Sunday. So let's focus today's session solely on these three things:

1) Wednesday lesson + Weekend activity understanding
2) Whether you were able to complete last week's Projects targets?
3) What are the challenges you are facing in the projects?

Also, this week will be visiting our _Proud Indian Edoofians_ from Wednesday to Saturday. So, the sessions will not be held at that time. And I will be very happy to share the updates of our visit with you as the days go by?

I hope this message finds you well. As your EWYL progresses, it is important that you stay up to date with your assignments and coursework. In order to ensure that you are able to move forward with the new lessons, I want to remind you that you must complete all of your previous assignments by the end of this week.

It is essential that you take the time to thoroughly review and complete your previous assignments. Doing so will not only help you to understand the lesson better, but it will also prepare you for the upcoming lessons. Failure to complete the previous assignments may result in a delay of the new lessons, and ultimately, it may impact your EWYL progress.

Therefore, I urge you to make the completion of your previous assignments a priority. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to seeing your completed assignments and to sharing the new lessons with you soon.

Best regards,

However, I would like to assure you that I will be available to connect with you in our upcoming session on Monday\/Tuesday. Please make sure you mark your calendars and plan to attend that session so we can address any questions or concerns you may have and proceed with our discussions then.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. I am looking forward to our next session and I hope to see you all there.
