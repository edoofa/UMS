Here in Africa some people use to think that education is only for male child ,even now they are people who still have that mind  but l learnt that Education is very necessary for every child whether boy or girl .It helps a person study new things with skill and learn about the facts of the world.Education plays an important role in protection of women's right .It also helps to prevent discrimination based on gender . Education increase productivity in their work .An Educated woman has skills , information, talent and self confidence that make her a better mother.
