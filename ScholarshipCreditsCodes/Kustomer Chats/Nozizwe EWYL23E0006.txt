23/06/23, 19:07 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello Edoofian,
We hope this message finds you well in your academic pursuits. We are excited to share a Saturday activity centered around learning from influential personalities. Our chosen figure is Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of Liberia and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Through her remarkable leadership and unwavering determination, she has left an indelible mark on history. Let's draw valuable lessons from her life for our personal development.

Two traits that stand out about Ellen Johnson Sirleaf are resilience and visionary leadership. These qualities can greatly contribute to our growth and development as individuals. They can positively impact our academic pursuits, relationships, and future career goals.

To develop resilience, we can learn from Sirleaf's ability to bounce back from challenges. We can seek out difficult experiences and learn from them, cultivating a mindset of perseverance and adaptability.

Here are some suggestions to help you get started:

Identify two traits: Reflect on Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's qualities that resonate with you.

Reflect on personal development: Consider how these traits can positively impact your academic pursuits, relationships, or future career goals.

Create an action plan: Outline practical steps like seeking mentorship, practicing self-discipline, engaging in community service, or pursuing relevant courses and extracurricular activities.
Let's embark on this exciting journey together and make Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's legacy an integral part of our own lives.
Best regards,

Team Edoofa

Today I would like to start this session by telling you the difference between EWYL Group and EWYL LINE.
This is the EWYL LINE, where all your sessions will be conducted. The timings of your session are from 12:00 pm to 1:00 pm. Make sure that you come for the sessions without reminders and are active throughout these 60 minutes.

Whereas EWYL GROUP is only for giving out important information and forms.

May I know is this clear?
27/06/23, 15:45 - Nozizwe EWYL23E0006: Yes, it is
27/06/23, 15:52 - Jasmine Kaur: Great, Now I would like to tell you that you have to come on the EWYL LINE every day, irrespective of the fact that you have your session or not. You have to come to the EWYL LINE everyday , first thing in the morning and chant *I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN*

This will be counted as your attendance. You have to do this only here on the EWYL LINE.
27/06/23, 15:53 - Nozizwe EWYL23E0006: Ohh okay.
27/06/23, 16:21 - Jasmine Kaur: The next thing is that you will be getting your lessons and activities only here on the EWYL LINE. If you didnâ€™t come on the Line that day, you will not be getting the lesson or the activity. I hope I am clear
