14/12/22, 19:25 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr

14/12/22, 20:41 - Jasmine Kaur: Today I wanted to discuss the recent message I shared with you. The message that we want to be our daily habit, our words of connecting and experiencing a sense of belonging, We all at team Edoofa are very thrilled as we personally are undertaking the same activity. May I know what have you understood from this message, what is the intention behind the same?
15/12/22, 18:11 - Jasmine Kaur: Rise and shine this morning edoofian,
I hope you are having a good day!


Here is the quote for today:

 I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. –Michael Jordan

16/12/22, 20:15 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello, my proud edoofian!
Let us start your session.
I have a simple riddle for you to start with:
You can see it every day, but you cannot touch it. What is it?
16/12/22, 21:57 - Katelyn EWYL22E0584: The sky
16/12/22, 22:00 - Jasmine Kaur: It is the sky! 
My proud edoofian with the competence and consistency you can touch the sky as well. With the right kind of determination everything is possible.
16/12/22, 22:02 - Jasmine Kaur: Effective and timely feedback is a crucial part of a successful performance, as I discussed with you in our Saturday activity. Before our Session tomorrow, I wanted to get in touch with you to share your EWYL report card and ask you to evaluate your performance by responding to the following questions:

1. How would you rate your performance from 1-10, 10 being the highest score?
2. What is your goal- in terms of skills and amount of scholarship credits that you want to earn?
3. What is your plan- how will you achieve the above mentioned goal?

The answers you give here will be evaluated by Ms Deepali and Ms Davi. So take you time and share your responses here in the group itself before our session.

17/12/22, 17:31 - Jasmine Kaur: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

The holiday season is upon us and it’s time to light up the Christmas trees and indulge ourselves in the festivities. I assume due to the Christmas and New year seasons everyone is in a buoyant mood?

 Well, then I implore you to avail this time to spend with your family and friends. We are announcing holidays from tomorrow, 24th December 2022 to till 1st January 2023. You are required to report on 2nd January 2023.
Go out with friends to parties, eat with no concern, go to a church or set up Christmas at your home. Have a Christmas and New Year of your desire. Then come back with much more energy as your EWYL team has planned a very fruitful year ahead of you.

Many more projects, more skills to master, more exposure to new companies, more knowledge, and more surprises.

 Are you excited? Well, let the passion in you burn as we are waiting for you to come back stronger. Let’s make a new resolution to new ventures with discoveries that are waiting to happen.

 Happy Holidays,

09/01/23, 23:48 - Jasmine Kaur: Let us start with attempting your weekend Activity : 

\"Sell me this pen.\" That might just be the best sales one-liner in history.

Over the last 10 years, I've seen many sales leaders use this question as part of their interview process to whittle out the \"can-dos\" from the \"can-nots.\" 

It's a favorite amongst sales professionals, from used car salespeople to Wall Street wolves. And for good reason — it's an exciting, accessible way to test a salesperson's fundamentals. How someone responds to those four words can tell you a lot about how — and how well — a candidate is going to perform in his\/her job. 

Let's try to respond to this prominent question as part of weekend submission. Your response must be shared in at least 150 words. The submission deadline for the same is *09\/01 time : till 3 pm today*.
I'm anticipating a highly original and creative response from your end.

11/01/23, 20:30 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello My proud Edoofian, 

Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals towards achieving this goal. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

I would appreciate you sharing your learnings from today’s lesson. 

Happy learning!

17/01/23, 07:42 - Jasmine Kaur: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

17/01/23, 19:38 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my lovely edoofians, hope you are doing well.

I have some amazing news and an opportunity to share with you. But first, do you know, A 2018 report by WaterAid India and Menstrual Hygiene Alliance India (MHAI) states that there are 336 million menstruating women in India, out of which only 121 million use sanitary pads. Assuming that these women use eight sanitary pads for one cycle (conservatively), a simple calculation reveals that almost one billion sanitary pads are used and disposed of every year.  The primary component in all disposable sanitary napkins is plastic. This takes approximately 500-800 years to fully disintegrate after disposal. Assuming one billion DSNs are disposed of every year, handling menstrual waste becomes a mammoth task.

And the solution to this problem is Sustainable menstruation!

Wondering what it is :

* Sustainable menstruation refers to the use of alternative products during one’s menstrual cycle for the benefit of the body and the earth.
* Sustainable menstruation is being mindful of the negative effects disposable sanitary products have on our environment in an effort to reduce the plastic waste ending up in our oceans or landfills.

I would like to invite you to our webinar on Sustainable menstruation tomorrow I.e. 18th January 2023, wherein we will be joined by Dr.Aarushi Kehar Malhotra. She will be helping us understand it better and how can each one of us be the solution to this problem.

Don’t forget to join by 5:45 PM IST, the webinar will start exactly at 6:00 PM [2:30 PM: Zimbabwean time] . Don’t be late for this webinar. Come prepared with the questions that you might have!

17/01/23, 23:36 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay I will tell you a strategy to follow for community building project now  you have to reach out the students.
So, you can approach the students through a whatsapp group i . e you can make a group of the students who you think would be interested in edoofa.

In that group you can pitch edoofa using the edoofa FAQ document and you can add me as well.

Later we can send the *application form* in the same group so that they can fill and submit it in the group itself so that I can have a look at them and submit it further.
