It’s Fungisai Tswatswa I heard from Asher that you wanted to reach out to me
18/01/23, 00:20 - Fungisai EWYL22E0450: 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Fungisai Tswatswa and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Fungisai EWYL22E0450'
18/01/23, 17:20 - Unknown: Greetings Fungisai!
How are you?
18/01/23, 17:20 - Unknown: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
18/01/23, 17:20 - Unknown: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
18/01/23, 17:21 - Unknown: Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *03:00-06:00 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
18/01/23, 17:21 - Unknown: Are you ready?
18/01/23, 19:57 - Fungisai EWYL22E0450: Thank you and I understand
18/01/23, 20:50 - Unknown: That's great!
18/01/23, 20:50 - Unknown: May I know on which project will you be working in the month of January?
19/01/23, 04:24 - Fungisai EWYL22E0450: Connecting with students
19/01/23, 20:58 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian!
Hope you are doing well.

While listening is an important skill, the art of asking questions is equally, if not more, important when it comes to learning more about your work tasks, unlocking hidden opportunities, delivering better results, and mitigating unforeseen risks. 
We have five guidelines to keep or to start asking good questions.

We discuss the following things:
1) what did you learn about it
2) progress on projects
19/01/23, 21:10 - Unknown: May I know how will you connect with students?
19/01/23, 23:41 - Fungisai EWYL22E0450: Honestly I’m not yet sure but I’m thinking of reaching out through friends in Zimbabwe
19/01/23, 23:42 - Fungisai EWYL22E0450: Good evening 
I’m a proud edoofian
19/01/23, 23:44 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
19/01/23, 23:49 - Fungisai EWYL22E0450: I do it every morning or anytime of the day
20/01/23, 06:04 - Unknown: For *Community Building Project*

Some of my students have formed WhatsApp groups with names like Edoofa Scholarship Prog\/Study In India\/Mission India by Edooda and so on…
This is how they begin-
First, they keep sharing the link of that WhatsApp group (which they formed) in their family groups, class groups, and school groups (A-Level and O-Level), with the children who stay nearby (who want to pursue their higher education), and, try to circulate all around.
Second, once new people get added to the group, they are told about Edoofa, the perks of being associated with it, why studying in India could be a great opportunity, their journey so far, learnings from EWYL Program, and more.
Third, they share the community building form with them, and then the children fill out the form and share it with me.
20/01/23, 06:05 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
20/01/23, 06:05 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
20/01/23, 06:05 - Unknown: Please excuse me for texting you late after the session's timing but I did not want to miss any updates from your end.
23/01/23, 18:14 - Fungisai EWYL22E0450: I’m a proud edoofian
23/01/23, 18:16 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up.

How are you?
You have been inconsistent with following the daily ritual, sharing your understanding of the lessons and activities plus updates on the projects.
So as per the simple policy of the Academic Board of Edoofa, we discontinued sharing lessons and activities with you.
But I hope you also understand that there are certain regulations as per the Edoofa Academic Board also.
For being inconsistent for this long, I have kept it a simple thing with all my students, that they have to follow the daily ritual for three days consistently without fail so that I can see that they have the potential to be regular.
10/03/23, 00:59 - Fungisai EWYL22E0450: Okay I understand

I hope you are doing well. This message serves as a gentle reminder for your Wednesday lesson. It is important to continue learning and developing your skills in order to advance in your career.
