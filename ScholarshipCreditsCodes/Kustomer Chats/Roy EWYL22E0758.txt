As we embark on today's session, let me share a motivational thought: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill. This quote reminds us that every step, be it a triumph or a stumble, is part of our journey.
Now, tell me, how did you celebrate Christmas? I believe celebrations are not just about the festive season but also moments of personal victories and joy. How are you doing, and is there anything you'd like to share about your experiences during the holiday season? Let's explore the path ahead together.

üåå "Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning." - Albert Einstein üåü
As we delve into Einstein's insightful words, we're reminded of the dynamic journey of learning and growth. "Learn from yesterday" encourages reflection on past experiences, "live for today" emphasizes the present moment, and "hope for tomorrow" instills a forward-looking mindset.
In the context of your academic pursuit, this quote beckons you to embrace the continuous cycle of learning, applying knowledge in the present, and fostering hope for the future. Each question you pose becomes a stepping stone to new discoveries and personal development.
So, how are you doing today? üåà I'm buzzing with excitement to explore, learn, and grow together in our session.

12/01/23, 20:03 - Unknown: Wednesday Lesson

Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals towards achieving this goal. Today‚Äôs Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

I would appreciate you sharing your learnings from today‚Äôs lesson. 

Happy learning!

13/01/23, 17:58 - Roy EWYL22E0758: -Wednesday wisdom is all about teaching is skills and lessons that are not on the syllabus. 
This week's Wednesday wisdom was all about teaching us 5 problem solving strategies from Charlie Munger, a billionaire business partner of Warren Buffet. 

The first strategy was problem simplification. Here he was said it is best to simplify these problems by deciding big 'no brainer' questions first. 

His second helpful notion mimics Galileo Galilei's conclusion that scientific reality is often revealed only by math as if Math was the language of God. So in short, without numerical fluency, in the part of life most of us inhabit, one is like a one-legged man in an ass kicking contest. 

Hhevtalked about inverting the problem as a third strategy which will not always help you solve it, but it will help you avoid trouble. 

Studying the basics was his fourth helpful notation. The basics are something that keeps coming up. Here i learnt that if one's thinking relies on others, they will suffer much calamity. 

As a last problem solving strategy, Charlie Munger talked about Lollapalooza effects(really big effects). He mentioned that these ones will only come from large combination of factors.
