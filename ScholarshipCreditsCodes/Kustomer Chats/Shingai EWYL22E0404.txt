12/11/22, 21:16 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

12/11/22, 21:17 - Shingai EWYL22E0404: Ok thank you
16/11/22, 03:50 - Shingai EWYL22E0404: Greetings how are you
16/11/22, 03:53 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr

I would like to share a brief message about the importance of planning in our lives and as an organization as well!


Planning is definitely significant as it directs us where to go, it furnishes direction and decreases the danger of risk by making predictions. The significant advantages of planning are provided below:
Planning provides directions: Planning assures that the objectives are certainly asserted so that they serve as a model for determining what action should be taken and in which direction. If objects are well established, employees are informed of what the company has to do and what they need do to accomplish those purposes.
Planning decreases the chances of risk: Planning is an activity which permits a manager to look forward and predict changes. By determining in prior the tasks to be completed, planning notes the way to deal with changes and unpredictable effects.
Planning decreases overlapping and wasteful activities: Planning works as the foundation of organising the activities and purposes of distinct branches, departments, and people. It assists in avoiding chaos and confusion. Since planning guarantees precision in understanding and action, work is conducted on easily without delays.
Planning encourages innovative ideas: Since it is the primary function of management, new approaches can take the form of actual plans. It is the most challenging project for the management as it leads all planned actions pointing to growth and of the business.
Planning aids decision making: It encourages the manager to look into the future and make a decision from amongst several alternative plans of action. The manager has to assess each option and pick the most viable plan.

        After that, you are contacted by your *Admissions Officer* {Miss Vilsha\/Mr. Milan}.I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now you must be aware that all your admissions related queries like: your VISA process, Registration fees, AAL etc. would be addressed\/handled by the Admissions Team.

13/01/23, 20:45 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian,
I am apologetic for the delayed response; I was spending quality time with my family!
I asked you to report on 2nd January but, because I was not in town I could not reply in time.
I hope you enjoyed New Year,
I am really excited to know what you did on the NYE!!
I went for a staycation with my family at one of the very beautiful properties in Chandigarh ( a city ).
*Let’s exchange our experience and then we will start with our learnings and curriculum.*
13/01/23, 21:03 - Shingai EWYL22E0404: It's ok no issue ...i went to Manali Himachal during my holiday to see snow ...it was really a great vacation

 The ability to solve problems is a basic life skill and is essential to our day-to-day lives, at home, at school, and at work. We solve problems every day without really thinking about how we solve them. For example: it’s raining and you need to go to the store. What do you do? There are lots of possible solutions. Take your umbrella and walk. If you don't want to get wet, you can drive, or take the bus. There is no right way to solve this problem and different people will solve it differently. However in our Wednesday wisdom we learnt about some Problem solving strategies. As part of your Saturday activity, I want you to share with us a problem that you encountered very recently and how did you Solve It. Did you use any strategy that was similar to what Munger has talked about?

Looking forward to your responses!


We will continue the discussion we left on Monday! 
Do not forget to send *I am a proud edoofian* even on Sunday!!

Do share your results with me on Monday, if they’re out.
