03/07/23, 16:49 - Jasmine Kaur: Good, So let us talk about community Building
03/07/23, 16:50 - Jasmine Kaur: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
Here is the message -
03/07/23, 16:50 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe.
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

03/07/23, 16:56 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0793: Okay mem
03/07/23, 16:57 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0793: I have been questioning myself as l was trying to relate, my current credits with the forms l hve submitted so far but l couldn't get it, and now it makes sense. Credits are given according according to the assessment of the student you hve referred
03/07/23, 16:59 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, you get credits whenever a studnets enrolls or registers.
03/07/23, 17:00 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0793: What if a student is enrolled how many points do you get
03/07/23, 17:05 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0793: Thank you for the guide, l know it will greatly reflect a difference
03/07/23, 17:15 - Jasmine Kaur: Let me share the credits with you. 
1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
03/07/23, 17:19 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0793: Okay

Maybe l might need your suggestions too
03/07/23, 18:04 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, you are thinking in the right direction Takudzwa. You can definitely join more groups and can use social media platforms.

Let me share my understanding with you about this  Wednesday wisdom  on consistency.
05/07/23, 23:26 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0793: Wednesday wisdom

Topic : consistency

Consistency is a quality that can truely shape someone's path to success, both academically and in life.

It can be referred as a secret ingredient that fuels progress, builds credibility and establishes good habits.

It is one of the most powerful traits that can lead to success in various aspects of life, whether personal development or work relationships being consistent helps build momentum, credibility and trust.

Consistency on its own breeds progress and l regard it as a number 2 tool of achieving long term goals
For example the  long term goal is to pass  final zimsec ordinary level exams, suppose there are two students, student A and student B. Student A studies and reads  his notes  everyday on preparation for the exam for an hour and student B studies and  reads his notes once per month for 5 hours. Basing on facts  student A is likely to produce better and excellent results as he exerts consistent academic effort.
Same as in fitness consist workout and exercises will result to a fit muscular body.

Another example is that a student who consistently devotes l hour of study everyday will obviously build a strong academic foundation  as compared to a student who studies towards exams
06/07/23, 00:33 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0793: Consistency build credibility. It  When people observe you consistently delivering on your promises or consistently display a certain behavior  they develop trust.
For example  an online delivery campany might be able might be able  to cultivate customer loyalty and trust by practicing consistent good behavior of  good customer service and on time delivery.
Inconsistency  creates doubts and erodes trust.

Consistency establishes good behavior. Consistency is a cornerstone  of good behavior. When you consistently engage  in a good behavior it becomes easy to maintain it. This applies to various  areas of life such as healthy eating   regular exercises or even practicing mindfulness.
Example  morning walk
Bedtime prayers.

Consistency nature's perseverance.
As we all know life is filled with challenges and setbacks, consistency helps a person to stay resilient and motivated in the face of obstacles.
When you constantly work towards your goals setbacks become mere bumps on the road rather than derailing you entirely.

Consistency strengthens relationships.
06/07/23, 00:33 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0793: My network was so bad mem sorry for late submission, l deeply apologize

You highlighted the significance of consistency in achieving academic excellence. By consistently studying and dedicating time to your studies, you can build a strong academic foundation and achieve better results compared to sporadic studying. This principle applies not only to academics but also to other areas such as fitness, where consistent workouts and exercises lead to a fit and muscular body.

01/02/23, 17:31 - Aditi Kapoor: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people.

I hope that you will be performing this ritual everyday on the *EWYL DEDICATED LINE* at 9 AM With help of the above text, can you define who an Edoofian is?
03/02/23, 18:21 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0793: Okay l will perform the ritual at the given time without fail.

I hope you are doing well!

Let us start our day with a quote: “Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.”
08/02/23, 21:12 - Aditi Kapoor: The inner sense of captaincy is a vital component of leadership that gives individuals the confidence and determination to make a positive impact. It involves having a deep understanding of oneself, embracing weaknesses, and having a positive growth-oriented mindset. Developing an inner sense of captaincy can help individuals navigate challenges, inspire and motivate others, and tap into their full potential as leaders. In today’s Wednesday wisdom, we will explore the importance of this aspect of leadership. 

We will discuss your key learnings in our today’s session!
