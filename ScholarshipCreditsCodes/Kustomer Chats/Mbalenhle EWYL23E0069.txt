01/12/23, 22:31 - Mbalenhle EWYL23E0069: So far in my projects I managed to get one of the students I submitted to you on August..

02/12/23, 09:54 - Mbalenhle EWYL23E0069: Wednesday Wisdom..
In this case the important part is we engage in learning lessons, skills and experiences that are excluded from the syllabus.This help us analyse and make us more creative as working towards finding our true selves.This is essential as it boost us in our journey to becoming successful leaders. 

The Power of Analysis that is effective to us as it unleashes our potential through Input-Output.
Inputs are significant because they're the building blocks of any task given.Another thing is this open one's mind to analyse and come up with an activity to do that at the end is an Output.In this part, the result of this is the effort put on evaluating whether the output is along the line with the requirements of the task.

One thing I learnt from Wednesday Wisdom is that the power of analysing is a tool to unlock the future and helps one understand the world.Also, the art of analysing Inputs and Output is also crucial.Therefore, all this empowers one's mindset in engaging in any task.

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL

05/12/23, 14:05 - Mbalenhle EWYL23E0069: From the EWYL projects I've and still learning a lot.It has helped me think critically on terms of how to approach people when advertising and teaching them the journey through this scholarship program.It is not easy to convince and inform a person about this wonderful program at first because they sometimes feel like it is a scam but nevertheless at the end of the day I advise them to use internet and research about Edoofa and to their surprise they find it legit.Although not all of them are interested but a few wish to but because of their background they fail to be part of this.In this journey I've faced many problems of being underestimated by people who think this is a scam,failed to be in contact with some of the Heads of schools due to different reasons such as being ignored, I've failed to atleast get 10 people who are interested in applying for this scholarship but fortunately and with faith I am strong and managed to go through all these circumstances as I try everyday to apply my effort in doing my projects
05/12/23, 14:16 - Mbalenhle EWYL23E0069: The unexpected discoveries I made along the way are educating and being able to explain well about this scholarship program to different people and I am happy because my confidence is now boosted.I can be able to interact with people in a good way.I have met different characters in this universe and able to know important things through researching.Also, the ways in which I can improve upon my results in future projects are seeking help and consulting you where I need help and continuing to apply myself fully by hardworking on my given projects
05/12/23, 14:19 - Aditi Kapoor: I appreciate the detailed insights you shared about your experiences and challenges in the EWYL projects. It's commendable how you've navigated through skepticism and successfully advised individuals to explore Edoofa through online research, demonstrating the legitimacy of the program.
Your perseverance in the face of challenges, such as being underestimated and encountering difficulties in reaching school heads, is truly inspiring. Your determination to overcome these obstacles and continue putting in daily efforts into the projects is remarkable and reflects your commitment.
05/12/23, 14:20 - Mbalenhle EWYL23E0069: Yes ma'am I get you clearly.
