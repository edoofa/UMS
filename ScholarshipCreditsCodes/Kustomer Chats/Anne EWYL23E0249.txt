How are you doing today?
14/09/23, 13:17 - Anne EWYL23E0249: Iam good how are you
14/09/23, 13:20 - Ananya: I am good, Anne! However, I asked you to follow your EWYL ritual at least so that I can share lessons with you. May I ask then why didn't you do that?
14/09/23, 13:22 - Ananya: It would be tough for me to manage your attendance if you do not take care of it yourself. I won't be able to assist you in that case.
14/09/23, 13:24 - Anne EWYL23E0249: Iam working towards on writing my final examinations in 18 October so lm very occupied and pressured at school
14/09/23, 13:30 - Ananya: I get it, Anne! That's why I've allowed you to have some flexibility. All I'm asking is for you to do one simple thing: send a quick message saying "I am a proud Edoofian" to your EWYL line. It literally takes just 2-3 seconds. This way, I can make sure you don't miss out on your attendance and the benefits that come with it. It's for your benefit, Anne!
