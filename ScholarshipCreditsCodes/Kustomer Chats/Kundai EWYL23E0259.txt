12/07/23, 12:48 - Kundai EWYL23E0259: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I amKundai Ashley Kupeta and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is KundaiEWYL23E0259
13/07/23, 07:59 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Kundai!
How are you?
13/07/23, 08:00 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
13/07/23, 08:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
13/07/23, 08:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù
13/07/23, 08:08 - Saloni Rastogi: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *12:00-01:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
13/07/23, 08:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
