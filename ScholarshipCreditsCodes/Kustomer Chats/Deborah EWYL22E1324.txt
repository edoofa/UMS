08/06/23, 16:14 - Deborah EWYL22E1324: Yes that's right
08/06/23, 16:30 - Jasmine Kaur: It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Our sessions are on Monday and Thursday from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM. If you miss a session, we can arrange a make-up session on Wednesday or Saturday.

08/06/23, 17:35 - Jasmine Kaur: Now, let me share this week's lesson with you Deborah. 
Today, we have something special in store for you. Our focus will be on a book titled "The Start-Up of You," a thought-provoking read that offers valuable insights and learnings applicable to our personal and professional lives.

To make the most of today's session, I encourage you to diligently read the accompanying PDF. Take your time to absorb the concepts, anecdotes, and strategies shared within its pages. The Start-Up of You presents a compelling perspective on how to navigate the ever-changing landscape of the modern world, emphasizing the importance of adaptability, resilience, and seizing opportunities.

As proud Edoofians, we strive for continuous improvement and seek knowledge from every available resource. "The Start-Up of You" provides a roadmap for success and empowers us to forge our own paths, adapt to change, and embrace new opportunities.

I am confident that today's lesson will inspire you, challenge your thinking, and equip you with valuable tools to navigate the ever-evolving world. So, let's dive into the material with curiosity and an open mind, and let's engage in meaningful discussions with me to maximize our growth potential.

I hope you had a restful and rejuvenating weekend and you are in great spirits. Are you ready to make this week a productive and successful one?
19/06/23, 18:17 - Deborah EWYL22E1324: Yes am ready
19/06/23, 18:28 - Jasmine Kaur: Deborah, are you aware of your session timings? 
It is disheartening to note that, following the weekend break, you have been unable to attend the session with the level of engagement required. It is essential that we emphasize the significance of time and value each other's commitment.
Regrettably, due to your inactive behavior during today's session, we were unable to fully utilize the allocated 60 minutes. This lack of active participation will hinder your progress and will prevent you from getting the maximum benefits of the EWYL program.

Moving forward, I recommend that you fully comprehend the importance of punctuality, and active participation, and value my time as your mentor. Now it’s time to end our session here and we will meet on Thursday at 12:00 pm.

Have a nice day ahead!
19/06/23, 18:32 - Deborah EWYL22E1324: Sorry for the delays

Two traits that stand out about Ellen Johnson Sirleaf are resilience and visionary leadership. These qualities can greatly contribute to our growth and development as individuals. They can positively impact our academic pursuits, relationships, and future career goals.

To develop resilience, we can learn from Sirleaf's ability to bounce back from challenges. We can seek out difficult experiences and learn from them, cultivating a mindset of perseverance and adaptability.

Create an action plan: Outline practical steps like seeking mentorship, practicing self-discipline, engaging in community service, or pursuing relevant courses and extracurricular activities.
