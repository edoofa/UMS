I am very predictable and responsible  which gives a sense of security in life . I rarely do anythig that is unpredictable or unplanned .l also value history and tradition . I enjoy being the best at what I do and I believe there is a right way to do everything .
30/05/23, 11:48 - ELYDAH EWYL23E0049: Good morning 
How are you today
30/05/23, 11:48 - ELYDAH EWYL23E0049: I am proud EDOOFIAN
30/05/23, 11:49 - Jasmine Kaur: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
30/05/23, 11:51 - ELYDAH EWYL23E0049: 4 . All of the above
01/06/23, 02:26 - ELYDAH EWYL23E0049: The simplest ways I gain satsifacation from life is by dedicating my time  to a cause that I feel passionate about , community service in particular offers numerose opportunities for me to utilize my talents to help . I decide to volunter for the youth clean up campaign . The people who help with these programs are fellow members of my church congregation and they are willing to discuss the advantages of cleaning the environment . Among all my commitments to community services these programs impacted my character in a positive way and allows me to feel proud of myself . Additionally thi volunteer opportunities helps youths to work together as a community and live in the clean environment and these reduces number of diseas like cholera , typhoid . These volunteering campaigns also teaches youths about drug abuse  because youths are the future leaders of tommorow and this the community together.

SATURDAY ACTIVITY
Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week’s Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better—together. It’s why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger—as successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!

So, may I know if were you able to complete the Saturday Activity?
12/06/23, 17:34 - ELYDAH EWYL23E0049: I haven't completed it yet. Currently working on it
12/06/23, 17:41 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, Make sure to submit your activity by the end of today. 
Now, Here I am sharing the Newsletter for the week. This week I would like to share some knowledge about how Failure is an inevitable part of our lives and how it teaches us to grow and build resilience. Also, check out the Edoofian Hall of Fame of the Bulawayo Proud Edoofians!
12/06/23, 17:57 - ELYDAH EWYL23E0049: Since l have opted for a path toward success with the Edoofa Program
I will have to keep in touch with my mentor regularly, and update them on any future plans, goals and opportunities now and even when l am at the University. It would be cordial to refer the Edoofa Program to my fellow peers and probably host a small discussion so our community does not give in to the thought thay its all a scam.  As time passes many ways to expand and deepen our relationship as Proud EDOOFIANs such as collaborating on new projects and initiatives will unveil and it would be a fruitful journey. Special efforts like being trustworthy, being a good communicator, showing up to sessions ( against all odds) are paving way for me to be part of building a better and stronger network as a proud EDOOFIAN.

The simplest ways I gain satisfaction from life is by dedicating my time to a cause that I feel passionate about community service in particular offers numerous opportunities for me to utilize my talents to help.I decide to volunteer for the youth clean up campaign.The people who helped with these programs are fellow members of my Church and they are willing to awareness campaigns to help the community discuss the advantages of keeping our environment clean. Of all my commitments to community service these programs impacted my character in a positive way and allows me to feel proud.Additionally these awareness campaigns helps youths to work together as a community and keep the community clean saving mother planet and upholding our Sustainable Development Goals.Helps the youth to maintain sovereignty not only in the community but country wide reducing the outbreak of diseases such as cholera and typhoid.These awareness campaigns also teaches youths about drug abuse because youths are future leaders of tomorrow and brings community together.After the clean up campaign,which is on every Friday of each month as youth we have extra activities we engage in like baking, sewing and welding in small groups so as to operate effectively and get money as youths instead of sitting on bridges doing drugs because youths are the future leaders.

15/06/23, 17:23 - Jasmine Kaur: Our scheduled session from 12:30 Pm to 1:30 pm has now come to a close. I wanted to take a moment to emphasize the significance of time management and the importance it holds for both of us. As a mentor, my role involves supporting and guiding multiple students throughout the day. To ensure that I can give each and every student my undivided attention, I have carefully allocated my time. It allows me to devote ample focus and dedication to every individual, including you.

Unfortunately, you missed today's session. I understand that unforeseen circumstances may arise, but I encourage you to make a conscious effort to attend our sessions punctually. By doing so, we can make the most of our time together and ensure a fruitful and productive learning experience.
