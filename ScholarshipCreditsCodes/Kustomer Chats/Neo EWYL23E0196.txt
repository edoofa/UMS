30/05/23, 16:27 - Ananya: Today we're going to talk about how to find student-centric SMEs in Africa using Google and LinkedIn. Are you familiar with these tools?
30/05/23, 16:28 - Neo EWYL23E0196: Yes ma'am
30/05/23, 16:31 - Neo EWYL23E0196: But l don't know how to use Linkedln
30/05/23, 16:32 - Ananya: No worries, we'll go through it step by step. Let's start with Google. When you're searching for student-centric SMEs in Africa, what keywords do you think you should use?
30/05/23, 16:33 - Neo EWYL23E0196: Rising SMEs in Zimbabwe
30/05/23, 16:34 - Ananya: That's a good start. You could also try "student-centered SMEs in Africa" or "African startups focused on education". Once you have a list of relevant startups, the next step is to find the company officials on LinkedIn. Have you used LinkedIn before?
30/05/23, 16:35 - Neo EWYL23E0196: No ma'am
30/05/23, 16:37 - Ananya: That's okay. LinkedIn is a professional networking platform where you can connect with people in your industry. First, you'll need to create a profile if you haven't already. Then, you can search for the company you're interested in by typing the name of the company into the search bar.
30/05/23, 16:38 - Neo EWYL23E0196: Following ma'am
30/05/23, 16:44 - Ananya: Now before finalizing the company, make sure to read the guide once again and take these points into consideration:

1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.‚Äã
