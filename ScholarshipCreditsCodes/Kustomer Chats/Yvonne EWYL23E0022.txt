17/05/23, 19:42 - Jasmine Kaur: Lesson
18/05/23, 21:33 - Yvonne EWYL23E0022: Yesterday's lesson was talking about leadership. In the past it is said that excellent leaders came up with methods in giving direction , implementing plans and motivating people. However the lesson's main objective was to talk about the leadership that is displayed by the Edoofa founders, Mr Angad and Mr Avreen Singh, which is servant leadership. Servant leadership in which the leader serves the people. It is different from traditional leadership in which the founder focuses on the thriving of his or her business or organization. A servant leaders shares power, puts the needs of the employees first and helps out the people to develop and perform highly. The leader works to serve the people and not vice versa. A servant leader has certain qualities or traits that he or she carries according to Larry C. These traits include listening, conceptualism, foresight, healing, empathy, persuasion, awareness, community building, stewardship and commitment to the growth of the people. When it comes to listening a good leader should be able to pay attention to what people are saying and to understand their perspective. A servant leader should be able to empathize understanding the people's interests. A servant leader should be able to take responsibility for the people's actions thereby displaying stewardship. To add on, the leader should be able to predict events that are likely to occur in the future through past experiences which is foresight. Lastly the leader should be self aware of themselves that is being able to fully understand themselves and to be able to build a community in their organization.

24/05/23, 12:15 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Morning dearüòÑ
I hope this message finds you well.
I wanted to let you know that as you are aware that our founders are currently in Africa, and we have been occupied with organizing a Meet and Greet event in Zimbabwe. Consequently, I have been quite busy making all the necessary arrangements.

Additionally, in honor of Africa Day, we are planning to visit our students at their respective universities and join them in celebrating this special occasion. I hope you will appreciate the importance of these engagements
24/05/23, 14:41 - Yvonne EWYL23E0022: I will do so
Thank you
24/05/23, 15:32 - Yvonne EWYL23E0022: Good afternoon Ms Jasmine

24/05/23, 16:30 - Jasmine Kaur: No dear, the correct answer is David Motsamayi
24/05/23, 16:30 - Jasmine Kaur: Here is your lesson for the week.

‚ÄúWhen I discover who I am, I'll be free.‚Äù ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, learn more about your own self, and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.
24/05/23, 16:30 - Jasmine Kaur: Here is the audio

29/05/23, 16:54 - Jasmine Kaur: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.

c. Nelson Mandela of South Africa
d. Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe
30/05/23, 15:33 - Yvonne EWYL23E0022: D

It's time for our exciting Saturday activity! üéâ This week, we dived into the captivating world of entrepreneurship, exploring the remarkable stories of four inspirational entrepreneurs. I'm confident that you have thoroughly researched and read about each of them in detail.

Now, I invite you to reflect on the entrepreneurs we discussed and share your favorite among them. In 200 words, I encourage you to highlight two similarities and two dissimilarities between yourself and your chosen entrepreneur.

As you analyze these similarities and differences, consider various aspects such as their journey, mindset, values, and achievements. Remember, this activity is an opportunity for self-reflection and to identify areas where you can draw inspiration or learn from these exceptional individuals.

By examining the similarities, you may discover shared traits, passions, or aspirations, creating a sense of connection and motivation. Exploring the differences can help you recognize unique qualities and perspectives, encouraging you to embrace your own individuality and strengths.

So, take your time, think deeply, and express your thoughts in a well-crafted 200-word response. Feel free to share your insights, and let the inspiration from these entrepreneurs propel you towards your own entrepreneurial dreams.

20/06/23, 00:18 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Evening
It's time for you to get the newsletter
20/06/23, 10:35 - Yvonne EWYL23E0022: After going through these   entrepreneurs I noticed similarities between Divine and myself. I am similar to her in the sense that just like her  l am a goal getter. Once I achieve something I always find another stepping stone to enhance and uplift my current skills and position. Divine could have stopped after founding Securico but she proceeded into farming by founding Zvikomborero farm. Furthermore, l am similar to her in the aspect of being persuasive. Working or starting a business in a male dominated environment can be very challenging. This is because people some people, especially the male figures, will try to drag you down by simply being uncooperative because they believe that manly jobs cannot be done by women. However, Divine did not let this stop her, she persuaded her way through and this is exactly what I do,  there is no boundary for me in the way of my dreams. However, I am not much of a farming person like she is, but I however prefer to venture in  beauty therapy and be directly involved with people. Lastly I am an adventurous individual who likes to travel the world and be able to share my ideas with the world, I do not like to be constricted to one place. Moreover, I like to challenge myself and this makes me different from Divine.
