05/01/24, 13:17 - Mangoma EWYL23E1040: I believe active participation in a student journey is essential in developing some important skills needed in life not only in our future jobs but also in the societies we live. I also in a school journey active participation can also help the student understand better through communication. It also helps student teachers, counselors or tutors understand and learn their student weaknesses hence also helping the students in getting better grades and achieving their goals in life.

06/01/24, 14:55 - Aditi Kapoor: Absolutely, your perspective is insightful. Active participation indeed plays a crucial role in developing a range of skills that are valuable not only in future careers but also in various aspects of life. Effective communication, understanding weaknesses, and fostering collaboration are key components of personal and academic growth.
It's wonderful to see your awareness of the broader impact that active participation can have on both students and educators.
06/01/24, 15:41 - Mangoma EWYL23E1040: I attended seminars learning Computer science.  It was my first time attending a seminar and I was in Lower Six (form 5). I was afraid to share my thoughts every time we were given a chance to talk by the discussion leader. It was a peer to peer discussion while receiving the help from the teachers. We had to spent three days away from our school. The first day a lot of my questions were left unanswered. That's when l learned the importance of participation. I also learned that l should have self confidence and that was the only way I could share my views without fear.  From this day, l started participating and started gaining a lot from our discussions. From  these discussions, l gained more knowledge and some easier methods used in answering and approaching  examination questions. Despite these benefits l also gained confidence. I learned to be free around many strangers.
06/01/24, 15:51 - Mangoma EWYL23E1040: I also learned why fellowship is important and that is how I managed to make new friends.
