04/11/23, 11:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Kafula!
I hope this message finds you well. I would like to extend my sincere apologies for the inconvenience I may have caused over the past two days.

On Thursday, I experienced an unexpected deterioration in my health, which required me to be urgently taken to my home. Unfortunately, this left me in a situation where I was unable to inform you about my absence from our session.

Then, on Friday, I had the obligation to attend a grand orientation event at one of our partner universities. Given the importance of this event, I found it necessary to be present.

Once again, I deeply apologize for any disruption my absence may have caused, and I assure you that I value our commitments and responsibilities. I am committed to making up for any missed work or obligations in the coming days.
04/11/23, 11:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Thank you for your understanding and patience during this time. Please let me know if there is anything specific I need to address or catch up on.
04/11/23, 13:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

As part of your Saturday Activity, I encourage each one of you to dedicate some time to journaling for just one day. Let your thoughts flow freely onto the pages, expressing your feelings, ideas, and observations. Take this opportunity to delve deep within yourself and discover what truly matters to you. Your journal can be a canvas for your dreams, fears, aspirations, and daily experiences. When sharing your journal, feel free to discuss your insights, challenges, and any personal growth you may have experienced through the process.

I believe that this activity will not only enhance your writing skills but also nurture your emotional intelligence and self-awareness. I look forward to reading and discussing your journal entries during our upcoming session. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Happy journaling!

06/11/23, 13:11 - Kafula EWYL23E0404: Journal Entry - November 6, 2023

Dear Journal,

Today has been a day of introspection and self-discovery. As I sit here under the shade of the old acacia tree, the rustling leaves and the distant call of birds seem to be my only companions. I've often turned to this tranquil spot to escape the chaos of the world and explore the depths of my thoughts and emotions.

One recurring theme that has occupied my mind lately is the pursuit of happiness. What truly matters to me? Is it the pursuit of material wealth and success, or is it something more profound and meaningful? I've come to realize that the answer lies in the connections I forge with others, the simple moments of joy, and the impact I can make on the lives of those around me. It's not the possessions I accumulate, but the experiences and memories I create that define my life.

Challenges have not been in short supply, and I've faced moments of doubt and uncertainty. The fear of failure has often loomed large, but I've learned that it's through these trials that personal growth is nurtured. Each obstacle I've encountered has become an opportunity for self-improvement, and I've become more resilient and adaptable as a result.

Observing the natural world around me has been a source of solace and inspiration. The way the acacia trees stand tall and unwavering, their roots deeply anchored in the earth, teaches me the importance of staying grounded in the face of life's storms. The seasons change, and so do the circumstances of our lives, but the essence of who we are remains constant.

I've also discovered the power of gratitude. In counting my blessings, I've found that even on the most challenging days, there's something to be thankful for. This simple act of recognizing the beauty in the world around me has transformed my perspective and brought peace to my heart.

As I close this journal entry, I carry with me the understanding that the pursuit of genuine happiness is a lifelong journey. It's about embracing the present, learning from the past, and looking forward to the future with hope. The canvas of my life is painted with dreams, fears, aspirations, and daily experiences, and I intend to make it a masterpiece that reflects the true essence of who I am.

With renewed determination and a heart full of gratitude, I look forward to each new day with the hope of becoming a better version of myself.

Yours sincerely,
Kafula

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I want to extend my heartfelt wishes for a joyous and successful festival to all. During this festive break, I'll be keeping an eye out for any updates and eagerly awaiting our next interaction.
When I return, I promise to share photos of our traditional dress and our festive rituals. I would also be deeply touched if you could light candles and earthen lamps at your end, don your traditional attire, and share pictures with me. Let's keep the Diwali spirit alive together, even from afar! Wishing you a wonderful celebration. 🪔✨🎉

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

How are you doing?
21/09/23, 13:02 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
21/09/23, 13:02 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - “I am a proud Edoofian”
21/09/23, 13:03 - Saloni Rastogi: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter

3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
21/09/23, 13:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *09:30-11:00 AM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
21/09/23, 13:03 - Saloni Rastogi: If you are ready then we can begin🎉

To facilitate this process, we kindly request all students to submit their time management strategies and plans for maintaining constant communication with mentors during the exam period.
Your submitted strategies will not only help you stay on track during the exam period but also enable your mentors to provide you with the support and guidance you need.
We appreciate your proactive approach to effective time management and mentor communication during this crucial time. Your success is our priority, and we are here to support you every step of the way.
