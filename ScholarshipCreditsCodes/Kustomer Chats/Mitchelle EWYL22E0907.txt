The feedback we have received from some of you on this week’s Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.
As part of this week’s Saturday Activity, you are required to share your written submission on : 
What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?
There is no word limit, so feel free to express your understanding in detail. The second answer requires some mental work, so sit with yourself, introspect, and share your honest answer with your mentor. 
Let this activity play an important role in your personal goal setting. We will connect soon in our upcoming session.

13/03/23, 15:50 - Unknown: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

20/03/23, 17:42 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian!

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!","transform":"
