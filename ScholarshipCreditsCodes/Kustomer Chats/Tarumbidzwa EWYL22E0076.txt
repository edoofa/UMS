14/02/23, 00:57 - Tenzin: One morning, an elderly man was walking along the beach when he noticed a young boy picking something off the sand and throwing it into the sea.

As he got closer, the man realized the child was throwing stranded starfishes that had washed up on the shore back into the breaking waves.

Approaching the boy, the man asked what he was doing.

“The starfish will die if they’re still on the shore when the sun rises,” he replied.

Perplexed, the old man said, “But that’s pointless! There are countless miles of beach and thousands of starfish. It doesn’t matter how many you return to the water, you can’t make a difference.”

Unfazed, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish, and tossed it into the sea.

“It matters to this one,” he said.","transform":"

The feedback we have received from some of you on this week’s Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.
As part of this week’s Saturday Activity, you are required to share your written submission on : 
What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?
There is no word limit, so feel free to express your understanding in detail. The second answer requires some mental work, so sit with yourself, introspect, and share your honest answer with your mentor. 
Let this activity play an important role in your personal goal setting. We will connect soon in our upcoming session. 
Till then, happy learning and happy growing!","transform":"

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!","transform":"

The assignment will encourage you to identify their goals, develop a financial plan, and cultivate the mindset and habits needed to achieve financial success.

Here are some instructions to make it easy for you to work on this assignment:
1. Goal Setting: The first step towards wealth creation is to set clear and achievable goals. In this section, write down your short-term and long-term financial goals. Explain how each goal will contribute to your overall financial success.
2. Financial Planning: A financial plan is a roadmap that outlines how you will achieve your financial goals. In this section, develop a comprehensive financial plan that includes strategies for budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management. Identify the resources you will need to achieve your financial plan and explain how you will access them.
3. Mindset and Habits: Wealth creation is not just about having a financial plan; it is also about cultivating the mindset and habits that will help you achieve your goals. In this section, identify the mindset and habits that are necessary for financial success. Explain how you will cultivate these qualities in yourself and develop strategies to overcome any obstacles that may arise.
4. Conclusion: In this section, summarize your findings and discuss the importance of preparing yourself for wealth creation. Reflect on what you have learned throughout the assignment and discuss how you will apply these principles in your own life.

During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.
