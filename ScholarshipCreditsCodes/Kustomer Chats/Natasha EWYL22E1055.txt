16/05/23, 16:08 - Natasha EWYL22E1055: The lesson was about Belonging . So I learnt  that belonging is not just a feeling but it is also an ability that can be developed and nurtured over time. I learnt that belonging as an ability involves being able to navigate different social situations and environment effectively.it is the ability to connect with others,build relationships, establishba senseof belonging that allows individuals to feel valued, accepted and appreciated. I also learnt that one way to develop belonging as an ability is to actively seek out opportunity to connect with others and this may involve joining clubs, organization groups that have similar interests of values volunteering on the community, participatingin activities. It also requires individual s to have a strong sense of self awareness and self acceptance. Belonging as an ability also involves being able to adapt to different social situationsbsnd this requires individuals to be flexible and open minded
