And well some of you, because of your consistency, diligence, willingness to show up for your sessions, and performance in your weekly activities have gotten this opportunity to work on a project with Skooqs. 

You are probably aware of the possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. This week, I want you to think of a few skills or practices that a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits. 
Please list the skills that are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring in a lot of learning.

15/07/22, 00:55 - Tenzin: Now Did you also work on the Wednesday wisdom task I shared with you yesterday Talent?

Personally I found it very interesting as it discussed the life and struggles of Patrice, an African Billionaire and I believe my students should take inspiration from him.
15/07/22, 02:30 - Talent EWYL22E0089: I was not given any work
15/07/22, 03:07 - Tenzin: I have shared it now Talent. You have to  request the lesson and the activity on the respective days. please keep that in mind.
15/07/22, 19:56 - Tenzin: Hello Talent!
16/07/22, 04:27 - Talent EWYL22E0089: ASSIGNMENT:
From the story that was sent l learnt that it is not always that the road to success will always be smooth if life was  like that then it would be like  a flat smooth road leading to no where in life we meet tribulations and it is those tribes that mould us and make us who we are it makes us be better people and have better attempt to life challenges for example our main character started by selling liquor with his father then later on owned a spaza starting a business needs someone who is determined and so courageous not willing to give up anytime soon.( wednesday wisdom lesson)
16/07/22, 21:40 - Tenzin: Amazing work on the Lesson task. I saw that Patrice had the wisdom to recognize and grab the opportunities that time brought for him and that is what set him apart from others and made him who he is.
16/07/22, 21:41 - Tenzin: Please also send the Proud Edoofian message tomorrow. Let's not miss out the momentum even on Sunday.??

Greeting of the day, my proud Edoofian! How are you doing?
22/07/22, 20:28 - Tenzin: Good to read your response on this lesson Talent! I am glad that you were able to understand the crux of that which is that successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it
22/07/22, 21:37 - Talent EWYL22E0089: Yes sir
22/07/22, 23:42 - Tenzin: Now Talent, Let's say you are working on projects and face challenges on them. How do you proceed with it?
22/07/22, 23:57 - Talent EWYL22E0089: I seek help from expetees
23/07/22, 01:17 - Tenzin: You have to be the owner of your success, you will face many challenges in terms of time management, internet and in regards to efficiency on the projects as well. However, you will have to make sure that you are working on the projects and making the best of the opportunity right?
23/07/22, 01:21 - Talent EWYL22E0089: Yes
23/07/22, 01:37 - Tenzin: So now how do you believe you have to use this approach and mindset on your projects Edoofian? Such as the community building project, Corporate alliance project or the School connect project?
25/07/22, 03:17 - Tenzin: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
