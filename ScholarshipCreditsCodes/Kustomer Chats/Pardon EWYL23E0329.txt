04/08/23, 13:25 - Pardon EWYL23E0329: I understood that before I travel to India, I should firstly research about the Indian traditions, customs and culture. I should be familiar with these before travelling. I should also be able to be familiar with basic local phrases such as greeting and expressing gratitude. These will help me to build connections with the locals easily.
I should also be familiar with Indian norms and avoid sensitive topics like of politics or religion unless if the conversation automatically leads to that. When I am in India, I should embrace and explore the Indian food and if the foods does not go in line with me I should talk to the responsible people politely so that my desires are accommodated. I should also have respect for everyone despite their social life and religion.

08/08/23, 11:42 - Pardon EWYL23E0329: PROJECT ONE .
BRAND ENDORSEMENT BY CELEBRITIES .

1. Brand endorsement by celebrities is a channel of brand communication which celebrities uses and acts as the brand's spokesperson and artifies the brand's claim and position by extending his or her status in the society or expertise in the field of the brand. Since the celebrities have vast followers in their social media platforms, they play a major role in marketing campaigns. With this, they reach out to many customers when they flaunt or endorse a certain product. For the past decades, the idea of involving celebrities to endorse product and services has been widely used  in marketing and advertising sector. The basic idea behind this strategy is to exploit celeb's fame, image and especially popularity to influence the customers to purchase a particular product or service. 
However, the impact of the impact of the celebrity endorsement on brand success can be implicated. Let me delve into the different aspects of celebrity endorsement on the and how it can give  brand an edge over their competitors in the market. The most significant impact of celebrity endorsement is their ability to influence customer's behaviour. This is because customers tends to trust celebrities more and these affects their purchasing decisions. For example when the well known celebrity endorses a product a perception is created in the minds of people that the product is high quality and worthy buying. Companies appoints  celebrities as their brand ambassadors to promote the awareness of the brand as well as increasing its sales like when the sports wear brand Jordan Nike Air appointed Michael Jordan as its brand ambassador.
08/08/23, 11:48 - Pardon EWYL23E0329: Alick Macheso was appointed the Red Cross Ambassador. This made most Zimbabweans to be aware of the brand and its services which it offers.
08/08/23, 11:48 - Pardon EWYL23E0329: Matthias Mhere is a brand ambassador of Simbi Legal Aid brands which made most people who wants to be legally represented in courts to trust it.
08/08/23, 11:48 - Pardon EWYL23E0329: Amara Brown is a brand ambassador of Parul University. Most people especially Zimbabweans trust Amara Brown because of her clean sheet of scandals hence they trust to be enrolled at Parul University because she had endorsed it.
