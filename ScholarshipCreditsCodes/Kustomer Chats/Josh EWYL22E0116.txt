20/11/22, 19:53 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
20/11/22, 19:54 - Unknown: Good day edoofian ,
Hope everything is well at your end!



I would like to share a brief message about the importance of planning in our lives and as an organization as well!


Planning is definitely significant as it directs us where to go, it furnishes direction and decreases the danger of risk by making predictions. The significant advantages of planning are provided below:
Planning provides directions: Planning assures that the objectives are certainly asserted so that they serve as a model for determining what action should be taken and in which direction. If objects are well established, employees are informed of what the company has to do and what they need do to accomplish those purposes.
Planning decreases the chances of risk: Planning is an activity which permits a manager to look forward and predict changes. By determining in prior the tasks to be completed, planning notes the way to deal with changes and unpredictable effects.
Planning decreases overlapping and wasteful activities: Planning works as the foundation of organising the activities and purposes of distinct branches, departments, and people. It assists in avoiding chaos and confusion. Since planning guarantees precision in understanding and action, work is conducted on easily without delays.

21/11/22, 20:57 - Unknown: Hello my proud edoofian, hope you had a great weekend!
Also, I wanted to communicate one thing with all my students
To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer and your EWYL Mentor.
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages. Let us get a better understanding of the three stages!
21/11/22, 21:20 - Josh EWYL22E0116: oky
22/11/22, 00:36 - Unknown: Your *counselor* is your first point of contact. Your counselor has been guiding you during your onboarding process where you learnt about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same.
        After that, you are contacted by your *Admissions Officer* {Miss Vilsha\/Mr. Milan}.I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now you must be aware that all your admissions related queries like: your VISA process, Registration fees, AAL etc. would be addressed\/handled by the Admissions Team.
Note: Your EWYL mentor\/counselor will not be addressing your admission queries
22/11/22, 00:37 - Josh EWYL22E0116: yes mentor
22/11/22, 00:39 - Unknown: Finally you will be starting your EWYL journey with your *EWYL Mentor*, where you get a chance to learn 21st century job skills and earn your scholarship credits which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
22/11/22, 00:57 - Josh EWYL22E0116: yes i am on the same age
