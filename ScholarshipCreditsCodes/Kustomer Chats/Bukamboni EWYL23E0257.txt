28/12/23, 23:49 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Evening, Bukamboni
How are you?
28/12/23, 23:52 - Bukamboni EWYL23E0257: I'm very fine
28/12/23, 23:55 - Jasmine Kaur: May I know why are you late for the session?
29/12/23, 00:00 - Bukamboni EWYL23E0257: The main reason for coming late for the sessions is network challenges.
I'm located in Binga one of the marginal places in Zimbabwe where the network in this place is a challenge.
29/12/23, 00:01 - Bukamboni EWYL23E0257: This is because of electricity which goes and comes back due to bad weather. So as electricity goes the network becomes a problem
29/12/23, 00:01 - Bukamboni EWYL23E0257: I'm sure you have also noticed my late responses
29/12/23, 00:01 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, Bukamboni
29/12/23, 00:02 - Bukamboni EWYL23E0257: However I'm really sorry for that
29/12/23, 00:04 - Jasmine Kaur: Don't worry about that. It is not your fault. 
So may I know that have you completed your Wednesday lesson?

29/12/23, 00:14 - Jasmine Kaur: Please go ahead and share your understandings with me.
29/12/23, 00:21 - Bukamboni EWYL23E0257: It's all about learning skills, lessons and experiences that are not part of the syllabus to discover our true selves. Therefore goal setting is the best tool to provide direction and purpose with a growth mindset
29/12/23, 00:22 - Jasmine Kaur: Did you read about the projects?
29/12/23, 00:25 - Bukamboni EWYL23E0257: Yes, I managed to reach out to a few students in the community who finished their senior secondary school this year. I briefly told them about the edoofa scholarship
29/12/23, 00:26 - Bukamboni EWYL23E0257: So is this the high time to create the group of these students and add you so that we shade more light to them.
29/12/23, 00:27 - Jasmine Kaur: You can definitely create your group and add me as well but I want you to take lead in the group and share all the information, Bukamboni.
29/12/23, 00:28 - Bukamboni EWYL23E0257: Okay okay there is no problem
29/12/23, 00:29 - Jasmine Kaur: Excellent job Your performance has truly impressed me, and you're on track to becoming an exemplary Edoofian. It's crucial to sustain this level of excellence, so please ensure timely submission of your lessons/activities and meet all the set targets.

29/12/23, 00:31 - Bukamboni EWYL23E0257: So how should I name the group
29/12/23, 00:32 - Jasmine Kaur: You can be creative with that. 
If you want my suggestion then you can name it as *Road to Success with Edoofa*
29/12/23, 00:32 - Jasmine Kaur: You can also choose some other name as well dear
29/12/23, 00:33 - Bukamboni EWYL23E0257: Ok fine
29/12/23, 00:42 - Jasmine Kaur: As our session is nearing its end, with the new year just around the corner in the next 2-3 days,
I'm eager for you to kickstart 2024 on a high note. To challenge and inspire you, I've set ambitious targets for the next session‚Äîaim for 5 applications (Community Building/School Project)
