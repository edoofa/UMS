27/12/23, 12:49 - Nkazimulo EWYL23E0680: 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am Ncube Nkazimulo and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is NkazimuloEWYL23E0680
28/12/23, 12:48 - Nkazimulo EWYL23E0680: I am a proud *edoofian*
28/12/23, 13:08 - Aditi Kapoor: Good morning! üåû‚òï

Wishing you a Thursday filled with positivity, productivity, and pleasant surprises
So are you ready for today's session?üöÄ
28/12/23, 13:20 - Nkazimulo EWYL23E0680: Sorry for the late response my network is poor
28/12/23, 13:21 - Aditi Kapoor: I understand!
28/12/23, 13:21 - Aditi Kapoor: We'll be beginning our new journey toward this earning and learning opportunity and I want you to commence with lots of enthusiasm and willingness to work hard to achieve your dreams as you wanted to build a community and I highly think of this as a great aspiration for giving back to the society and I am sure that this EWYL journey will not only help you to earn Scholarship credits but also upskill you and make you stand out from others and I want to make sure that you excel in all aspects of this journey.
28/12/23, 13:41 - Nkazimulo EWYL23E0680: Thank you
28/12/23, 13:43 - Aditi Kapoor: I'm eager to know what thrilling plans you have in store as you kick off your journey with these projects! What's your exciting plan of action?
28/12/23, 13:54 - Nkazimulo EWYL23E0680: Of course! I think the best way to kick start these projects is to break them down into smaller, more manageable tasks. It can be overwhelming to think about everything you need to do, so it's best to break it down into smaller goals. For example, one of project is to research companies in your area, you could start by creating a list of the top 5 companies you want to learn about. And then you could break that down even further, by setting a goal to research one company per week. That way, it feels more achievable and you can make steady progress.
28/12/23, 13:57 - Aditi Kapoor: This is an amazing strategy, Nkazimulo!
I am really impressed.
28/12/23, 13:58 - Nkazimulo EWYL23E0680: Thank you üíï
