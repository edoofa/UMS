01/10/22, 19:31 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

How was your weekend?

This weekend's activity was very interesting. I am very excited to discuss how you, my proud student, have planned your way to becoming _the edoofian of the month_ and _accomplishing their targets_. This weekend activity asked students to tell the following:

I want that you focus on any one project first and become exceptionally good at it first rather than focus on all.
04/10/22, 00:05 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know which project will that be?
04/10/22, 01:09 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Yes maam

06/10/22, 18:02 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
How are you doing?

As students, we constantly learn and expose ourselves to situations that help us learn anything and everything, but we must remember that each of us has the same number of hours in a day. Hence we must treat it important that we treat our Time as the currency of life. *Time Management* is essentially Priority Management.

In our session today on the *EWYL Line*, we will discuss:
1. How managing time is necessary
06/10/22, 18:05 - Saloni Rastogi: We need to plan on the number of forms that you need to bring under the community building project.
06/10/22, 18:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, I heard from Ms. Deepali that you are hosting a meeting for your fellow mates to help them update their LinkedIn profiles, I am so happy to hear that.
May I know when are you planning to hold the meeting today? I would appreciate it if we could arrange a call today and discuss the same, I would love to help you out on the same.
06/10/22, 18:11 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Greetings Ms Saloni , i hope you are doing well,  i am fine today
06/10/22, 18:12 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: I am hosting the meeting at my place at 2 pm today
06/10/22, 18:13 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing great, thanks for asking.
06/10/22, 18:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Can we have a call at 01:30 PM IST today?
We can discuss everything, like what should you tell them, what are they lacking, how will LinkedIn help them, and so on.
06/10/22, 18:14 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: You are welcome Ms saloni
06/10/22, 18:15 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Thank you  maam  for your help i really appriciate , i will be on time
06/10/22, 18:16 - Saloni Rastogi: So I will call you at 01:30 PM today.
06/10/22, 18:17 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: I will be there on time
06/10/22, 18:18 - Saloni Rastogi: Great.
So before that Doozy, what all have you planned to discuss with them?
May I know in what order you will discuss with them?
06/10/22, 18:27 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: I planned to disscuss them on 
How to put a professional profile picture 
How to update their about 
How to put their expriences on the profile 
And also to make sure that there make as many connections as they can in their field of study
06/10/22, 18:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Very well.
06/10/22, 18:28 - Saloni Rastogi: But before that Doozy, I feel it is very important that students know what LinkedIn is and why is it important to work on the same.
This will sure keep them motivated to hear you out Doozy.
06/10/22, 18:29 - Saloni Rastogi: What do you think?
06/10/22, 18:30 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: I think this is very good because i forget that in my bucket list
06/10/22, 18:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Noted, no worries.
I will share with you what all to discuss and how to go about it over the call.

We need to plan that and work on it from today onwards.

How are you?
09/10/22, 15:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello *My Proud Edoofian*!

Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. Those unfamiliar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.
Responses will be accepted on the *EWYL Line* only.
_Till then keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'_.

Happy learning and enjoy your weekend!

How's your day going?
14/07/22, 22:04 - Saloni Rastogi: No worries Doozy, in such a case where you feel that there will be a delay in the submission of the task, please inform me beforehand. But on the first go, try your best to complete all your task on time.
14/07/22, 22:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Doozy I am so happy to see you chant the daily ritual of 'i am a proud EDOOFIAN'.
14/07/22, 22:08 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your response Doozy and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a way. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. With can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.

14/07/22, 22:11 - Saloni Rastogi: SCRIPT
A very good day everyone, as a parent I was always wondering what these kids will do, they spend so much time on their computers and phone. Whenever I spoke to my boy he started talking about what new gadget is out, what are its features, and everyone in the family knew about his love for technology. So enrolling for Skooqs was not new, it was more or less an obvious decision I took for my boy. When we paid for our skooqs subscription and he started to study, I could see his excitement every time he designed a new mobile app or a new website, he was always eager daily to come to take her tech lessons on skooqs and also meet with his instructor. I have always been scared of what my children do on their phones and tablet but I am glad Skooqs is helping him use technology the right way, and his time is being utilized for his development and better future.
14/07/22, 23:43 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Thank you so much Ms Saloni i really appriciate
14/07/22, 23:52 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Maam at the testimonaial video of a parent i am facing challanges my parents now they are not at home they work  along the boader so there is a problem of network there , its difficult for me to connect with them
15/07/22, 02:55 - Saloni Rastogi: Doozy let me confirm that with Ms. Sanjana and then I will let you know.
15/07/22, 03:35 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Thank you so much Ms Saloni
15/07/22, 16:46 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Good morning Ms  Saloni i am a proud Edoofian
15/07/22, 16:47 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
16/07/22, 01:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Good day, DOOZY!
How's your day going?
16/07/22, 01:57 - Saloni Rastogi: As for the parent testimonial video, no worries if your parents are occupied there and are facing network challenges. Doozy you can take the help of your neighbor, guardian, or any relative who is like a parent figure to you.
Doozy I hope everything is clear now.  In case you are facing any challenges, please let me know.
I want the video by tomorrow (16\/07\/2022), at 12:00 PM. Hope that is fine?
16/07/22, 19:10 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Good morning Ms Saloni
16/07/22, 19:13 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: I am proud to be an Edoofian
16/07/22, 19:43 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Ms Saloni i have good news

16/07/22, 20:23 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: My mom ,  she managed to record her video and she send it to me
16/07/22, 21:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you please share the video on the EWYL group DOOZY please?
16/07/22, 21:16 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Ok maam let me share the video
18/07/22, 17:33 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Good morning Ms Saloni
18/07/22, 17:33 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: I am proud to be an Edoofian
18/07/22, 21:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my proud EDOOFIAN!
I hope you are doing well.
SWOT analysis might sound something complex but I am sure that while going through our weekend activity, you might have gone through what a SWOT means thoroughly and gained much knowledge on the same. The weekend activity asked us to draw a SWOT analysis of any company.
I want to share your response with me here DOOZY.
18/07/22, 21:30 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: I am doing fine  Ms Saloni 
I hope your weekend was doing fine
19/07/22, 04:37 - Saloni Rastogi: My weekend went well, thanks for asking.
19/07/22, 04:40 - Saloni Rastogi: What I read in your response, made me inquisitive to do more research on the mining industry in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe’s mining sector is highly diversified, with close to 40 different minerals.  The predominant minerals include platinum, chrome, gold, coal, and diamonds.  The country boasts the second-largest platinum deposit and high-grade chromium ores in the world, with approximately 2.8 billion tons of platinum group metals and 10 billion tons of chromium ore.  The sector accounts for about 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) and the minister of mines claims the sector has the potential to generate US$12 billion annually by 2023 if the government addresses challenges such as persistent power shortages, and foreign currency shortages, and policy uncertainties.
19/07/22, 04:40 - Saloni Rastogi: I am so blessed to hear your deep understanding and better grasping of the concept.
19/07/22, 04:41 - Saloni Rastogi: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader. 
Also Doozy, along with the SWOT analysis of a company, I would appreciate it if you also share a SWOT analysis of yourself. I want to see how much more you have learned beyond this activity.
19/07/22, 06:21 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Thank you maam
19/07/22, 06:21 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Am so sorry for late reply because today i was the one preparing the dinner tonight
19/07/22, 19:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day Doozy!
How are doing today?
19/07/22, 19:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Doozy I am sorry to inform y
19/07/22, 19:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Sorry for the glitch Doozy.
19/07/22, 19:52 - Saloni Rastogi: I am here to inform you that the parent testimonial video that you made did not get approved by Ms. Sanjana because it was clearly visible that your mother was looking at a script and saying all those words. I know it involved so much effort from your end and you know all the mentors in the team were applauding you a lot for working so hard in every session and being so consistent in your projects too.
19/07/22, 19:55 - Saloni Rastogi: I want Doozy that you request your mother to learn that script if possible. It is okay if she fumbles or skips 2-3 words. But looking at the script and making a bit evident won't work out.
19/07/22, 19:55 - Saloni Rastogi: Please let me know what you think on this.
19/07/22, 20:56 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: I am doing well Ms Saloni
19/07/22, 20:56 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: I  hope you are all well Ms Saloni
19/07/22, 21:00 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: I really appreciate that you do see my efforts , as for my mother's testimonial video i a can i undestand that she tried so much but she did not manage to memorise the script
19/07/22, 21:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Doozy I am so happy with the amount of effort you are making each day, makes me actually so proud of you.
19/07/22, 21:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Can we discuss on what can be done on that?
19/07/22, 21:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, as discussed above, I would really want you to share a SWOT of yourself.
19/07/22, 22:04 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Yes maam lets discuss what needs to be done on SWOT
19/07/22, 22:10 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Ms Saloni i need to know if i want to write my SWOT i should write my strengths and weaknesses
20/07/22, 01:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes Doozy.
20/07/22, 22:49 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Good afternoon Ms Saloni
20/07/22, 22:49 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: I am proud to be an Edoofian
20/07/22, 23:08 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: My strengths goes like this 
----> where ever there is a problem i try my best to have the solution.
-----> i did like to interact with with as many people as i can because i learn a lot from them 
-----> i am also good at creativity
My weakness goes like this 
----> i need to improve on my time management
----> i need to improve my public speaking skills
21/07/22, 21:18 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day Doozy!
How are you doing?
21/07/22, 21:19 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Good morning Ms Saloni
21/07/22, 21:19 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: I am a proud Edoofian
21/07/22, 21:20 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: I hope you are doing well today
21/07/22, 21:20 - Saloni Rastogi: This is good. You know what I feel is that a true leader is one who recognizes their weakness very well before knowing their strengths. It becomes very easier afterward to work upon them.
21/07/22, 21:20 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing great, thanks for asking.
21/07/22, 21:21 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
21/07/22, 21:21 - Saloni Rastogi: I am so happy to see your interest and fervor towards our daily ritual, makes me so proud to be your mentor.
21/07/22, 21:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's move toward our session DOOZY.
Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our *WEDNESDAY Wisdom* was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
3. Parent testimonial video (we can keep a deadline of 22\/07\/2022, 12 PM)
21/07/22, 21:28 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Dont worry maam my parent will make another video
21/07/22, 21:34 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Let me share my understanding with you , on  Wednesday wisdom
21/07/22, 21:34 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Let me share my understanding with you , on  Wednesday wisdom
22/07/22, 01:14 - Saloni Rastogi: That would be really great Doozy, please see the deadline and work out everything accordingly. I know you will come out with a brilliant video.
In case you face any problem, feel free to reach out to me anytime.
22/07/22, 01:15 - Saloni Rastogi: I am still waiting for your understanding on the Wednesday wisdom, hope you remember to share that with me.
22/07/22, 04:41 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: My main key take aways they are as following 
--->its better to give a try than to give up without even trying .
----> when ever we fail it better to notify our mistakes and also to find the way to rectify that mistakes 
----> i know that failure is not a good thing  in life but most sucessful people use failure as the means of their motivation to move forward but to their goals and aims 
----> maam i need to know something i really do try hard enough but sometimes i may have the resuits which are not that good as i expected them to be
22/07/22, 04:43 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your response Doozy and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
22/07/22, 04:46 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Thank you maam for showing me this path
22/07/22, 04:49 - Saloni Rastogi: We can start with the community building project.
What I think to work on them is by setting a daily target of 2 forms\/ per day. In this way, you will regularly work on them and keep on earning scholarship credits. What do you think?
22/07/22, 04:53 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: This is great Miss Saloni i will try my very best
22/07/22, 04:53 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Maam i have a problem the forms of the people i submitted those people they are not doing their councelling sessions yet
22/07/22, 05:40 - Saloni Rastogi: Till then Doozy you can get more forms filled till the time our counselors are reaching out to them.
22/07/22, 05:40 - Saloni Rastogi: Also Doozy can you please share the certificate that you got from the meet and greet with me please.`
22/07/22, 20:18 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Good morning Ms Saloni
22/07/22, 20:18 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: I am really sorry for replying so late
22/07/22, 20:19 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: I am being admitted at the 24hr clinic because i feeling a really bad headache
22/07/22, 20:19 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: Ok Ms Saloni let me share it with you maam
23/07/22, 03:55 - Saloni Rastogi: Thank you for sharing.
23/07/22, 06:35 - Doozy EWYL21E0314: You are welcome Ms Saloni
25/07/22, 03:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
