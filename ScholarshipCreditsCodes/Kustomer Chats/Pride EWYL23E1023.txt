I am waiting for your response.
04/01/24, 13:33 - Pride EWYL23E1023: So these lessons teach us to be more creative and truely discover our true selves. I learnt that active participation contribute to skill development and provide exposure to industrial expertise. There are some ways which can contribute to active participation such as networking,communication skills, leadership and team work,critical thinking and problem solving, industrial insights, specialized skill development and exposure to diverse perspectives.
04/01/24, 13:51 - Pride EWYL23E1023: Looking on networking we will see that there is industry connections and peer networking, where industry connections is when students ' events attract professionals and experts from different industries. When a student participate in these events, he or she gets opportunity to future career opportunities.  
Peer networking is when a students join in with different students during workshops and seminars thus community building and this gives the chance of sharing knowledge and creating a supportive environment for personal and professional growth. 

On communication skills, one founds him self in public speaking at seminars and this helps to build confidence when talking in public. It also gives the opportunity to express clear points

Learship and team work , you can even join projects and this helps to effectively work as a team , also help in the expanding ideas .

On critical thinking and problem solving,students should have seminars and workshops and this help to quickly examine the problem and give possible solutions
04/01/24, 13:59 - Unknown: Fantastic insights! It's evident you've grasped the essence of the  Wednesday lessons. Your understanding of active participation as a  catalyst for skill development and exposure to industrial insights is  spot on. I appreciate how you've delved into networking, highlighting  both industry connections and peer networking, showcasing a keen  awareness of the potential for future opportunities. Your reflections on  communication skills, leadership, teamwork, and critical thinking  demonstrate a holistic understanding of the multifaceted benefits of  these lessons. Keep up the great work!
