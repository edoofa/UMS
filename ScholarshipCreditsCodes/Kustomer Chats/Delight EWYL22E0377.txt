09/08/22, 00:22 - Delight EWYL22E0377: Like most successful  people Gilbert Eeugune Peters also has some factors or traits that enabled him to be a recognised entrepreneur at a young age and these include believing in himself  whereby after having discovered his skill of designing  he decided to offer his services and receive payments. He also manage to conquer his fears and had faith in what he did. More to that his hard work helped him develop his idea. The best thing about Peters is when he had developed  his idea,he focused on that one idea till it became successful  before focusing on the other which is something  that many people fail to do whereby they want to carry out many projects at once. Moreover he also got the strength to keep developing his idea from people who supported his vision as well as the prayers he made.

11/08/22, 01:44 - Delight EWYL22E0377: Good afternoon  from today's Wednesday wisdom I got to know the three mantras of success whereby the first one is forget luck ,live by intent whereby in order to be successful  one must not wait for a chance to come by because you might fail to get an opportunity  but instead should live by intent and capability as you are able to control  what happens to you.
Secondly for success to come your way, stop fixating on failure whereby when you fail never give up instead keep on pushing and correcting the areas you would have failed.
Finally  find your inspiration  whereby you  have to look for the things that motivate you to do what you are doing
