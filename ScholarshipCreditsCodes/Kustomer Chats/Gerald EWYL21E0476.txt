03/10/22, 15:55 - Unknown: Greetings, Proud Edoofian

This week we took a step back and reflected upon the objective of the EWYL program. We collectively reflected on why we should be regular with our projects, what these projects will help us earn, and how all of this will result in our individual financial independence.

Today, let's work on the next step which is to plan how to be financially independent by utilizing your time with the right projects. As an activity for this week, I want you to draft a document mentioning:

a)Target- no. of credits you want to earn in the month of October
b)How many projects can you work upon
c)Number of hours that you can devote to your projects
d)Name of the projects that you want to be a part of
e)Plan of action with your mentors

You are required to submit these answers by Today 6 PM. Let me know in case you face any challenges in Submitting the responses.

04/10/22, 18:36 - Gerald EWYL21E0476: I know I have been lagging behind a lot lately, but I believe I can handle it.

04/10/22, 18:42 - Unknown: Please let me know how can I help you, Gerald?
04/10/22, 18:45 - Gerald EWYL21E0476: Unfortunately, the only going either of us can do is be patient and wait for the situations to unfold. I'll explain to you in detail once everything is sorted out

06/10/22, 18:30 - Unknown: In case, You were not able to receive the Wednesday Lesson, I am sharing it below for your ease.

Hello My Proud Edoofians,

So we know, a lot of you have been keeping busy these days with your exams and academic curriculum. And while we wish you all the luck for it, we don't want you to miss out on your learning and skill building. In today's lesson, we will discuss how to build our capacity to multitask, manage our time and prioritize our daily tasks in order to have it all. 

Let's dig right in, and understand how if you follow these steps, you will be able to manage your exams, assignments, extra curriculars, and your EWYL projects all at one go. After going through this, you must discuss the plan of action to execute these steps with your mentors.

Happy Learning!

I believe that you would also agree with this, right?
11/10/22, 17:45 - Unknown: Gerald, I understand that I have given the break for this week but the only condition for this was that you will perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual every day atleast

11/10/22, 18:50 - Gerald EWYL21E0476: I'm sorry, this weekend I was either sleeping or training so anything to do with my phone was not in my mind. I am really sorry for not fulfilling my promise ?

For now, Please setup an alarm on your phone so that you do not forget to perform the ritual, okay?

13/10/22, 17:39 - Unknown: Gerald, I appreciate your submission but I hope that you realize this is the submission for last week's Wednesday Lesson.
The deadline for last week's lesson was last Friday 6 PM.

Yesterday, I asked you to submit last week's Saturday Activity. The deadline for that was Tuesday 6 PM but I gave you a leeway considering your case.

But don't you think, This is a bit unfair?
Due to the delay, You also missed out on the Wednesday lesson that I was not able to share with you due to the pending last two submissions.

Gerald, Today, At all costs, I would need the submission for the Last week's Saturday Activity.
I am sharing it below.

After that, I am sharing this week's Wednesday Lesson which you have to submit on Friday by 6 PM.

We can not allow ourselves to at a much mediocre pace.
13/10/22, 17:41 - Unknown: Now, I am sharing the Saturday Activity below:

Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!
