07/12/23, 15:41 - Ananya: Good afternoon, Tanyanyiwa!
How are you doing today?
07/12/23, 15:41 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: I am having network challenges today and l am having problems opening Instagram
07/12/23, 15:42 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: I am very well thanks and you
07/12/23, 15:46 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
07/12/23, 15:48 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: Okay noted
07/12/23, 15:51 - Ananya: Well, I believe we should begin with something that aligns with your interests. So, may I know which one is your favorite project: the community-building project or the school connect project?
07/12/23, 15:53 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: The school connect project
07/12/23, 15:54 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: So far l have collected seven contacts of different heads from different schools
07/12/23, 15:55 - Ananya: That's amazing, would you like to share the names with me?
07/12/23, 15:55 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: Yes yes ðŸ˜Š
07/12/23, 15:56 - Ananya: Alright, I am waiting!

Fletcher High School

07/12/23, 16:06 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: Okay
07/12/23, 16:12 - Ananya: Now that you have the School Headâ€™s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
07/12/23, 16:12 - Ananya: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
07/12/23, 16:13 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: Okay yes l promise
07/12/23, 16:14 - Ananya: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

11/12/23, 15:32 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: Okay
11/12/23, 15:43 - Ananya: Good morning, Tanyanyiwa!

Before diving into today's session, I want to share a few highlights with you from the recent webinar that took place for our students here in India!ðŸŒŸ

https://www.instagram.com/p/C0jSIPrvg_1/
11/12/23, 15:45 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: Okay but today l am having network problems but l will keep trying
11/12/23, 15:53 - Ananya: Is it stable now?
11/12/23, 15:58 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: Not yet
11/12/23, 16:03 - Ananya: By the way, I have seen that you have submitted the school form to me. May I ask how did you communicate with the school head?
11/12/23, 16:09 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: I communicated with him on Whatsapp
11/12/23, 16:13 - Ananya: Great, you know, 2023 is wrapping up. Don't you think we should kick off the new year with something big? How about committing to earning a specific amount of scholarship credits?
After all, you wouldn't want to head to India empty-handed.

I'm saying this from my own experience â€“ having some credits before you arrive in India isn't just a benefit for you; it's a help for your parents too. Not only this, we often pick students for internships and personal training based on their credits and regularity in the EWYL journey.
Believe me, you've got plenty of time right now being in your home country, so don;t you think we should utilize this time with our utmost dedication?
11/12/23, 16:15 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: Yes l agree with you
11/12/23, 16:22 - Ananya: I've finalized a few students for a 30-day challenge, and I want you to be a part of it. I need you to attend the sessions dedicatedly and put in the hard work for your EWYL projects.
Moreover, I'll set specific targets for you, and I want your commitment to work diligently to achieve them. As your mentor, I'll be there to guide and support you every step of the way. Is that alright with you?
11/12/23, 16:23 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: Yes that is alright
11/12/23, 16:26 - Ananya: Amazing! Let's set a new target for you. For the first 10 days out of the 30, I want you to focus on connecting with two schools and getting eight students to submit their offline application forms.
If you encounter any challenges during this time, reach out to me immediately because we need to achieve this target. I expect you to give it your best effort.
Seen
11/12/23, 16:30 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: Okay l will try my very best
11/12/23, 16:32 - Ananya: Now, I want to understand how you will try to achieve these targets. Do you have something in your mind?
11/12/23, 17:08 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: I will try to connect with the school heads tomorrow through WhatsApp and then after that l will try and find students interested to study abroad under Edoofa program
11/12/23, 17:24 - Ananya: Now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is scheduled for noon Thursday. All the best with your targets!ðŸš€

14/12/23, 15:38 - Ananya: Good morning, Tanayanyiwa!

Let us begin today's session with an interesting question: If you were allowed to spend a day in the life of a fictional character from any book or movie, who would it be and what adventures would you embark on?
14/12/23, 15:40 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: It would be Sai from the movie lost In love.l would spend the day in the hospital treating people,l would really love that & l will be the happiest person ever

14/12/23, 15:44 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: Thank you
14/12/23, 15:46 - Ananya: Well, Tanyanyiwa, you missed your Wednesday wisdom because you did not follow your EWYL ritual on time yesterday. You know, this is impacting your overall performance. Do you wish to have a gap in your graph of achievements just because of not following the small ritual?
14/12/23, 15:47 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: Am so sorry am really sorry for that but l promise l will never miss it again
14/12/23, 16:01 - Ananya: Alright, I want to share some amazing news you know, yesterday I was working with my students' credits! It seems like my students are back with so much excitement. I am so happy with their workâ€”everybody is so active while working on their projects. Many of my students are earning credits, and I am sure they will return to India with a lot of credits in their accounts!
14/12/23, 16:01 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: Wooow that's great,that's just amazing
14/12/23, 16:09 - Ananya: So, during our last session, we set a target for you. I wanted to know how you have come up with that. Are you facing any challenges?
14/12/23, 16:11 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: Yes l am facing challenges ðŸ˜ª
14/12/23, 16:17 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: Right now here in Zimbabwe there is marking of ZIMSEC Exams so principals are caught in National duty and am having challenges connecting with them but trust me am doing my best ..Another challenge is l stay in a community where lndia is looked down upon so no students are willing to persue their higher education there but as an Edoofian l won't give up l have started looking for those interested in other areas and so far l have found one student and l think l will submit their form by the end of the day

14/12/23, 16:34 - Ananya: Well, I understand Tanyanyiwa! Do you remember your counseling session, where you must have been informed about Sundar Pichai?
14/12/23, 16:36 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: Actually most of the sessions were done when l was at school so l would be lying if said l remember
14/12/23, 16:44 - Ananya: Well, alright! You can share this : Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?  Coming from a similar historical background of being ruled by the Britishers once, I was certain  of similarities between the Indian and the African cultures.  It has been 3 months that I have been living in India and even though it took adapting to the  environment, weather, and culture, it is so gratifying because it is a country full of resources that  are so cheap and affordable.  I was fortunate to come at a time when India hosted the G20 summit 2023 this year. The G20  summit is an annual international gathering of leaders from the world's 20 major economies,  representing both developed and emerging nations. It was such a proud moment for me  because fortunately this year The African Union became a full member of the G20 which  happened under Indiaâ€™s presidency. I believe this will help the development process in Africa  and draw investment to the continent which also means more opportunities for us here and back  home.  My understanding of India on the global map has greatly improved since I got here. The CEOs  and Directors of all leading companies like Google, Microsoft, Channel, Nokia, and IBM have all  been Indian graduates.
14/12/23, 16:45 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: Okay thank you

16/12/23, 17:44 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698: A story is told of a young boy who was very intelligent but was from a very poor background.This young boy was very determined.He was a humble person and a hard worker.Throughout his childhood he had dreams,he wanted to be a medical doctor but not only that, he wanted to be the best medical doctor in Zimbabwe.Unfortunately his parents had nothing,they could not even afford to pay for his education but this young boy was very determined and the word failure was not in his vocabulary.He started doing piece jobs so that he could raise money to pay for his education.In his neighbourhood there was a private school which was unaffordable so he would walk 20 kilometers  to the nearest government school which was affordable.He gave his all in school work and managed to attain distinctions  at Ordinary Level.His parents were proud of him and wanted him to go further but unfortunately they had nothing .At the school he learnt there was no Advanced level ,but as a perspiring doctor he had to do Advanced Level.As they say ,"The Almighty always pave way where there is no way." This young found a well wisher who was a teacher at the neighbouring school who was willing to pay fees for him.He was very happy and he took advantage of this opportunity.He worked extremely hard.He would study all night.He scored 15 points and made everyone so proud.He had all he needed to study medicine except for financial backup.He applied for a Higher life scholarship which is given to vulnerable students and lucky enough he got it.He went to study at the University of Zimbabwe for seven years and graduated with a first class degree in Bachelor of Surgery.Finally his dream was fulfilled and he made his parents proud.
