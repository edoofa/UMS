28/06/23, 16:30 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

01/07/23, 15:43 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!

03/07/23, 15:46 - Ryan EWYL22E1190: All thanks to the Edoofa scholarship program and all its associated members and services. I want to happily acknowledge the privilege of being part of the Edoofa family.Allow me to say,"l am a proud EDOOFIAN ✨".

Since ever l got trapped into the hands of the Edoofa family,everything  seemed to be what it is and it brought clarity on my true strengths and talents.One significant achievement that transformed my life in the shortest time possible is embarking on my EWYL journey, that is not only meant for me to earn credits but rather embracing new skills that are slowly becoming my habits.From being someone filled with self-criticism, lack of confidence, lack of experience, shyness, inability to delegate, disorganization to someone who is slowly adopting confidence, courage, bravery, resilience, perseverance optimism, interpersonal skills, future mindedness and the capacity for flow and insight to name several.

These life skills has solely figured out my purpose, strengths,values and personal success patterns thus building a a solid core and firm foundation that I can drive from.Rather than focusing on short term outcomes,these habits have helped me identify myself as the person I aspire to be and generate a stronger,powerful and more able me.

Multiple benefits now flow from having a firm foundation.By knowing my strengths, I know where my energy comes from and my unique value. Spending more time in strengths keeps me strong and help me grow in exponential ways.The growth feels good since it amplifies my impact and helps catalyze my efforts in countless ways.
By driving from who I want to be and creating the experiences I want to create, it's easier to choose paths when Icome to forks in the road.I simply have to choose the path that allows me to be more me.The more me l be,the more l am making the most of what l have got.The more I pave this path ,the greater my growth and the greater my growth, the more the fulfilment. So to wrap up my story ,allow me to once again say that  "l am a proud EDOOFIAN " and I am geared enough towards making a difference in the Edoofa society.

06/07/23, 12:57 - Jasmine Kaur: Good morning,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. As we prepare for our session today, I would like to start by asking you to share your "Wednesday Wisdom" with me before we begin. This will allow us to fully immerse ourselves in our 90-minute session and make the most of our time together.
See you in our session!
06/07/23, 13:16 - Ryan EWYL22E1190: Good morning Ms Jasmine
06/07/23, 13:26 - Jasmine Kaur: Morning Ryan. Are you done with your lesson?
06/07/23, 13:28 - Ryan EWYL22E1190: What do you mean?
06/07/23, 13:57 - Jasmine Kaur: Did you go through the lesson that i shared yesterday on Consistency?

06/07/23, 14:06 - Jasmine Kaur: Kindly share your understanding with me.
06/07/23, 14:26 - Jasmine Kaur: As we conclude our session, I would like to provide you with a weekend target.
Your task is to complete and submit 10 forms by Monday. You have ample time to work on them, so I encourage you to put in your best effort and ensure their timely submission. Remember to stay focused, work diligently, and complete each form with care.
Additionally, Don't forget to come on the Line every day.
Have a nice day ahead!
06/07/23, 15:04 - Ryan EWYL22E1190: I came to understand that consistency is the critical driver for success. Being consistent means dedicating yourself to your goals and staying focused on the things and activities to achieve them. However, it requires a long-term commitment and involves sustained effort in doing actions repeatedly until you achieve your target.Your productivity increases significantly and you're constantly motivated to just keep going, and do better every time. The more consistently you do something, the easier it becomes, and the more momentum you build up. Eventually, what was once a struggle becomes a habit, and habits are hard to break. That's why consistency is so important- it is the key to making lasting change.
06/07/23, 15:04 - Ryan EWYL22E1190: Have a nice day too
06/07/23, 18:47 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Job on the lesson Ryan.

Describe how their consistent approach has positively influenced and impacted not only their own life but also the lives of those around them. Reflect on specific instances or situations where their consistent behavior or mindset has motivated you to strive for excellence or overcome challenges in your own life.
