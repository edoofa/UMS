11/08/22, 20:28 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

12/10/22, 18:06 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!
12/10/22, 18:06 - Unknown: here is the activity sir
12/10/22, 21:35 - Panashe EWYL21E0013: I am a girl Sir.
12/10/22, 21:43 - Unknown: It was a typing error
13/10/22, 01:29 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.

Hope you are doing well. This week we learned about one of the most popular yet grounded people who used social media as a tool to become an educator and give back to the community and still become an entrepreneur.
This week I want you to reflect on what your strengths and skills are to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 

These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content etc.
Please share these skills and instances where you were able to showcase these skills in your next session.
Till then 
Happy Learning!

10/11/22, 17:40 - Unknown: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian,

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.
12/07/22, 19:52 - Unknown: Hello Panashe!
12/07/22, 19:53 - Unknown: Now Panashe, Did you also watch the video of the Edoofa's Africa trip that I shared along with the activity?
12/07/22, 20:47 - Panashe EWYL21E0013: Yes Sir l did
12/07/22, 22:33 - Unknown: was it inspiring Panashe?
12/07/22, 22:33 - Unknown: How did it make you feel and what was your takeaway from the video?
12/07/22, 23:29 - Panashe EWYL21E0013: Yes Sir it was very inspiring
12/07/22, 23:29 - Panashe EWYL21E0013: To be honest l felt heartbroken and also l was angry at myself. Honestly why didn't l attend the function ,that is exactly the question l asked myself when l watched the video.My fellow friends looked so happy and l believe they learnt a lot of things that day and obviously they are now more experienced than me.Most of the videos l watch on internet about the Edoofa Scholarship Program it's very rare for me to find a video that doesn't mention the names Mr Angad Singh and Mr Avreen and it has been my wish eversince l was told  they are the founders of Edoofa to meet them in person and l missed the chance..To be honest l can't show it on this platform but it's really painful.
13/07/22, 00:25 - Unknown: I absolutely understand your emotion Panashe. Even I could not travel with Mr Angad and Mr Avreen due to a challenge at home and I was fascinated to my students meet eachother and enjoying being part of the Edoofa community.
13/07/22, 00:26 - Unknown: You see, most of my students attended the event and since have been high on energy on their projects and now more dedicated to achive their goals and make their parents and me proud.
13/07/22, 00:26 - Unknown: I am sure the video must have inculcated the same in you as well?
13/07/22, 23:31 - Unknown: Hello Panashe!
25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
