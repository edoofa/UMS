The person should also be a good time manager. He or she should be able to manage time very well.

13/07/22, 16:09 - Aditi Kapoor: Good Morning, Aureen ?
I hope that you are good health and spirits
13/07/22, 16:10 - Aditi Kapoor: Aureen, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.
This way you will always be recognized by the Academics Board for new projects.
13/07/22, 16:11 - Aditi Kapoor: Also, Aureen, Can you please share Project Progress Form with me?
13/07/22, 18:05 - Aditi Kapoor: Also, Aureen, You haven't submitted any video yesterday also.

Let me check the app.
Can you also share the links of all the videos that you have shared on the app here?
14/07/22, 00:46 - Aureen EWYL21E0599: All of them
14/07/22, 15:44 - Aureen EWYL21E0599: I am a proud Edoofian. Good morning sir
14/07/22, 15:46 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
