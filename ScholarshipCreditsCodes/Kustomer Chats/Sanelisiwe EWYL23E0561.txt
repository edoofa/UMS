26/09/23, 12:56 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Sanelisiwe!

I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
26/09/23, 12:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù
26/09/23, 12:58 - Saloni Rastogi: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter

3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
26/09/23, 12:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *09:30-11:00 AM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.

We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services.

04/10/23, 16:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofians,

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

05/10/23, 13:09 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Sanelisiwe!
I hope you are doing well.

Today, we're discussing the *importance of belonging to a community in our journey towards success.*

Belonging to a community, whether it's a family, a social group, or a professional network, can be incredibly motivating. It gives us a sense of purpose and a desire to contribute and be recognized. Communities provide a support system that helps us overcome obstacles, and they are rich sources of knowledge and expertise.

As we explore the significance of belongingness, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic and any project updates you might have. Please share your views and updates here.
05/10/23, 14:52 - Sanelisiwe EWYL23E0561: The importance of belongingness is that it helps one move forward with life as it will be easy in one's journey when the community supports him or her...The community will give one the zeal to achieve goals because there will be less stress
05/10/23, 15:32 - Saloni Rastogi: I appreciate your insightful response! Belonging to a community indeed plays a vital role in one's life. Here's a fascinating fact: Studies have shown that individuals who actively participate in a supportive community tend to live longer, experience lower stress levels, and have improved mental well-being. The sense of belonging fosters a network of emotional and practical support, which can significantly enhance the quality of life and motivation to achieve personal goals. Being a part of a community truly empowers individuals to thrive! üåüü§ùüåç
