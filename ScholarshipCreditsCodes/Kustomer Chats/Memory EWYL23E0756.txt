As part of your Saturday Activity, I encourage each one of you to dedicate some time to journaling for just one day. Let your thoughts flow freely onto the pages, expressing your feelings, ideas, and observations. Take this opportunity to delve deep within yourself and discover what truly matters to you. Your journal can be a canvas for your dreams, fears, aspirations, and daily experiences. When sharing your journal, feel free to discuss your insights, challenges, and any personal growth you may have experienced through the process.

I believe that this activity will not only enhance your writing skills but also nurture your emotional intelligence and self-awareness. I look forward to reading and discussing your journal entries during our upcoming session. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Happy journaling!

25/11/23, 21:02 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL
