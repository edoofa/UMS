07/06/23, 14:17 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.
Our sessions are on Monday and Thursday from 12:00 PM to 1:30 PM.

Share in the comments if you have known this before and why is it important!!
12/06/23, 15:36 - Ananya: How are you, Kelvin? How was your weekend?
12/06/23, 15:41 - Kelvin EWYL23E0143: Iam good Ms Ananya, my weekend was just as good as yours I hope?
12/06/23, 15:42 - Ananya: It was amazing! Now may I know if you were able to complete your Saturday activity?
12/06/23, 15:50 - Kelvin EWYL23E0143: Yes I was, I sat down and actually reflected on myself and what I aspire to do during my life time, I have come to realize that at this point in time, motivation is nothing but a soothing sound that makes you keep going, and in order to make my dream a reality I need to     act upon it regardless of how I feel and what is in my way.
12/06/23, 15:54 - Ananya: Would you like to add What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately develop a stronger network for yourself?
12/06/23, 16:02 - Kelvin EWYL23E0143: That's right, during this precious and significant time I have spent and still spending with the Edoofa family, I have come to realize that dreams are nothing more than dreams if you as an individual do not act upon them. As of late I have been interacting with members of my community both my age, still in school and much older on the topic and emphasis in the Edoofa Scholarship program itself, it has been a maturing process as of late but in time I hope I will start to see and get results.
I, as an individual has been publicizing different articles in different social media platforms with an attempt to associate myself with individuals whom are passionately successful in the environment I would want to be when I finish up my tertiary education, these platforms include Instagram, Facebook, and recently I have started my LinkedIn profile, with a hope of associating myself with the right people in the industry.
12/06/23, 16:03 - Ananya: I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to you for your remarkable dedication to building a better and stronger Edoofa student community. Your commitment to understanding your strengths and weaknesses and actively working on improving them is truly commendable. By doing so, you are setting an inspiring example for others and contributing to the overall growth of our community.
12/06/23, 16:05 - Kelvin EWYL23E0143: Thank you for the compliment Ms Ananya, I really appreciate it.
12/06/23, 16:06 - Ananya: Now, would you like to share which project is your favorite?
12/06/23, 16:08 - Kelvin EWYL23E0143: In that subject I would like to say community building is by far the best project as it test out my social skills on a whole new level, I love it. The project allows me to interact with different people thus making it worthwhile as you hear different opinions.
12/06/23, 16:18 - Ananya: Great, so may I ask about your progress in that?
12/06/23, 16:22 - Kelvin EWYL23E0143: The program is a challenge as members I have account for at this point of time aren't putting that much of enthusiasm in the program, some of them even came up with statements saying they need to see me first go to India as proof it is legit.
12/06/23, 16:30 - Ananya: Well, Kelvin, you recently participated in the Meet and Greet event in Bulawayo, which turned out to be a tremendous success. Given your firsthand experience, don't you believe you're the perfect person to reassure others that this is not a scam?

Furthermore, you can share videos and photos from the event, as well as provide insights into what you and the counselor, along with Mr. Angad, are doing. By sharing your personal experience, you can help alleviate any doubts and build trust among potential participants.
12/06/23, 16:34 - Kelvin EWYL23E0143: I can sure do that, I have presenting them with tangible evidence as a starter, such like contact information of Mr Shubham and Mr Piyush, as well as some videos too.
12/06/23, 16:35 - Ananya: Absolutely! You can show your offer letter or acceptance letter from the university.
12/06/23, 16:37 - Kelvin EWYL23E0143: True, I never thought of that, thank you for your help Ms Ananya.
12/06/23, 16:38 - Ananya: You are most welcome, Kelvin!
12/06/23, 16:38 - Kelvin EWYL23E0143: Sure thing.
12/06/23, 16:38 - Ananya: May I ask if you have a facebook account?

12/06/23, 16:49 - Kelvin EWYL23E0143: Really!?, I would like to know what it is.
12/06/23, 16:55 - Ananya: In the search bar, search for 'Zimbabwe student community' on Facebook. Numerous groups will appear, where you can share the link to the group along with a brief description of the EDOOFA scholarship program.
12/06/23, 16:55 - Ananya: You can search for other counties as well, like Ghana and Zambia. This will help you build a larger community

27/06/23, 06:40 - Kelvin EWYL23E0143: [6/22, 12:47 PM] Kelvin: Sure thing, the lesson basis is around  Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first female president in Africa and her ways to becoming successful from her early struggles to her most groundbreaking achievements In her life which I'll illustrate below:
[6/22, 12:48 PM] Kelvin: First there is a foundation to tenacity where obligations in her life didn't stop the age in her to strive for her dreams
[6/22, 12:49 PM] Kelvin: Secondly there is Leadership in challenging situations and times, the ability to maintain a positive and professional appearance in all her struggles in life and take charge
[6/22, 12:52 PM] Kelvin: A commitment to her own integrity, the ability to maintain a clear path in mind and focus on her own goals and visions
27/06/23, 06:47 - Kelvin EWYL23E0143: These traits that Ellen Johnson Sirleaf had are an example of resilience, being a woman in a man dominated industry is no joke, the competition had to be stiff, and she had to face criticism on whether she was capable of doing a greater job, and the only thing that kept going for her was resilience. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf had to maintain a clear path in mind to which led to her archieve set desired goals in her life thus becoming the first female president in Africa.
27/06/23, 06:48 - Kelvin EWYL23E0143: I would like to add personally that the prospective of being resilience is one of my strong suits, being able to pick out some set desired goals and being able to see them through and all.
