15/07/22, 00:44 - Unknown: Did you work on the Wednesday wisdom task I shared with you yesterday Meghan?

Personally I found it very interesting as it discussed the life and struggles of Patrice, an African Billionaire and I believe my students should take inspiration from him.
15/07/22, 03:21 - Meghan EWYL22E0193: Sure sir Patrice is a great inspirational
15/07/22, 19:36 - Unknown: What did you learn from Patrice's story Meghan?
15/07/22, 19:49 - Meghan EWYL22E0193: I learnt that sometimes we have to take advantage of what surrounds us and learn from it just like Patrice who got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business from his own father .
15/07/22, 23:55 - Unknown: Amazing work on the Lesson task. I saw that Patrice had the wisdom to recognize and grab the opportunities that time brought for him and that is what set him apart from others and made him who he is.

Do you agree on this Meghan?
16/07/22, 00:20 - Meghan EWYL22E0193: Yes sir
16/07/22, 00:33 - Unknown: So, do you believe you are able to utilize the opportunity that the EWYL program creates for you? Are you able to fully leverage your opportunity to self fund your higher education?

18/07/22, 17:35 - Meghan EWYL22E0193: The fast growing industry in Zimbabwe

Despite being battered here and there by price and currency concerns gold still represents one of the big growth industries in Zimbabwe.

There are over 4 000 recorded gold deposits in Zimbabwe , the majority located on ancient workings . Gold mining and exploitation in Zimbabwe have been going on from ancient times. The gold mining industry contributes 8% towards the countrie's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

More than 90% of gold deposits in Zimbabwe are associated with greenstone belts which are one of the richest in the world. Other gold deposits occur in the Limpopo Mobile Belt in the south of the country and in the Proterozoic Piriwiri rocks in the north western part of the country.

Zimbabwe's mining sector plays a very significant role in the development of the country as it has continued to bring much needed income into the country. It contributes to foreign exchange,Gross Domestic Product, government revenues, capital information and infrastructural development.

However,it's overbearingly negative environmental impacts overweigh the socioeconomic benefits. Mining contributes to erosion, sinkholes, deforestation,loss of biodiversity, significant use of water resources,dammed rivers and ponded waters , wastewater  disposal issues ,acid mine drainage and contamination of soil ,ground and surface water , all of which can lead to health issues in the local areas.

Access and allocation of capital is often cited as one of the biggest issues facing the mining industry , especially for it's juniors. Production costs have impacted profit margins and left investors reticent to engage with new projects, especially with smaller companies.

The global mining industry growth rate is predicted to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12,4% from $1641,67 billion in 2020 to $1845,55 billion in 2021. In Zimbabwe, the mining industry remains important and the foreign currency earnings, though only

18/07/22, 23:57 - Unknown: you know meghan, As seen above, SWOT is an acronym of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. However, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym:

1 Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
2 Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
3 Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
4 Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by
19/07/22, 01:13 - Meghan EWYL22E0193: Thank you
19/07/22, 01:14 - Unknown: You know why SWOT Analysis is important? It can help you to challenge risky assumptions and to uncover dangerous blindspots about your organization's performance. If you use it carefully and collaboratively, it can deliver new insights on where your business currently is, and help you to develop exactly the right strategy for any situation.
19/07/22, 01:14 - Unknown: For example, you may be well aware of some of your organization's strengths, but until you record them alongside weaknesses and threats you might not realize how unreliable those strengths actually are.

Equally, you likely have reasonable concerns about some of your business weaknesses but, by going through the analysis systematically, you could find an opportunity, previously overlooked, that could more than compensate.
19/07/22, 02:05 - Meghan EWYL22E0193: Ok sir
19/07/22, 02:53 - Unknown: Now, What Are the Biggest SWOT Analysis Mistakes that people make?
19/07/22, 03:47 - Meghan EWYL22E0193: The biggest SWOT analysis mistakes that people make include,
1)Unable to record strengths and weaknesses of an organization alongside so that you realize how unreliable the strengths are.

2)If SWOT is used carefully ,it can deliver new insights of where. your business currently is , and help you to. develop exactly the right strategy for any situation.
3)Also , by going through the analysis systematically, you could find an opportunity, previously overlooked,that could more than compensate.
19/07/22, 20:46 - Unknown: Hello Meghan! How are you?
19/07/22, 20:48 - Unknown: Interesting insights Meghan! I believe these are the mistakes people make.

1 Making your lists too long. Ask yourself if your ideas are feasible as you go along.
2 Being vague. Be specific to provide more focus for later discussions.
3. Not seeing weaknesses. Be sure to ask customers and colleagues what they experience in real life.
4. Not thinking ahead. It's easy to come up with nice ideas without taking them through to their logical conclusion. Always consider their practical impact.
5 Being unrealistic. Don't plan in detail for opportunities that don't exist yet.
19/07/22, 21:57 - Meghan EWYL22E0193: Thank you
