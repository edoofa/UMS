How are you Ms Riva.
06/10/22, 22:29 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

08/10/22, 20:36 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!

16/12/22, 18:43 - Unknown: Hello, my proud edoofian!
Let us start your session.

I have a simple riddle for you to start with:
You can see it every day, but you cannot touch it. What is it?
17/12/22, 02:32 - Unknown: Effective and timely feedback is a crucial part of a successful performance, as I discussed with you in our Saturday activity. I wanted to get in touch with you to share your EWYL report card and ask you to evaluate your performance by responding to the following questions:

1. How would you rate your performance from 1-10, 10 being the highest score?
2. What is your goal- in terms of skills and amount of scholarship credits that you want to earn?
3. What is your plan- how will you achieve the above mentioned goal?

The answers you give here will be evaluated by Ms Deepali and Ms Davi. So take you time and share your responses here in the group itself.

After that l would go for reading knowledge filled books, l will gain more impactful knowledge from the books and those books will help me to level up. After wards l would note down something new which l have learnt and also include it on my *top to do list*.

Good morning Ms Riva.
23/07/22, 15:44 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

To use my learnings and experience to contribute to your career growth.
25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
25/07/22, 03:56 - Marlene EWYL21E0814: Hello Ms Riva. Thank you so much. I will send it next Sunday.

25/07/22, 16:59 - Unknown: Sat Activity:Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
This week, we discovered that people who are successful don't hold the world responsible for their failures. They accept accountability for their own choices and results. To develop this mindset of taking responsibility for everything and avoiding the blame game takes time and focus. As your Saturday Assignment your are required to write a short write up, on the growth mindset of successful people and how will you make sure you develop the same mindset. The word limit for this assignment is 150-200 words. Kindly make sure you follow the word limit strictly, any responses less than the minimum word limit will not be marked.
You are required to submit the same by Monday 12 PM  on the dedicated EWYL line.

Happy learning !
25/07/22, 20:56 - Marlene EWYL21E0814: Yes l had thank you for asking.
25/07/22, 20:56 - Marlene EWYL21E0814: *Saturday Activity*

Successful people in the world are people who have given up themselves to be risk takers, they always try out something  despite the negativity that may come along with it. That is how they develop a mindset of greatness in their life time. They have got a risk taking mentality which is the characteristics which is need to become great. Successful people believe that life is all about facing challenges and sailing and overcoming those challenges is what makes life interesting.

Successful people have got a mentality to propose an idea, they evaluate that idea before they set it on ground and it happens mostly that they propose measures to reduce any disaster from their goal, they bear it in mind that if something goes wrong they are to be accountable. Successful people give their entire focus on their business whether in loss or in profit, that is the reason why they keep on going. To develop such a mindset l will follow the path of being a risk taker and bearing it in mind that sometimes loss in business is inevitable and when l happen to run loss l have to keep going rather than giving up.

25/07/22, 23:43 - Marlene EWYL21E0814: *Question 1*

I realised as soon as I started reading this lesson that most of my students needed to learn and grasp this. One person succeeding and one failing depends solely on how effectively they manage their time. Try to comprehend and apply the measures discussed in the lesson to your everyday life. I'll be here to help you, so that you can focus on learning how to manage your time effectively. In our following session, please explain in detail what you learned from the lesson.Also, do not forget to send *I am a proud edoofian* tomorrow.

Happy learning
