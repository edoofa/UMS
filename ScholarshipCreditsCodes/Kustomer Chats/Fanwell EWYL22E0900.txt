20/05/23, 15:02 - Ananya: `- That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!`

`- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.``- How do you intend to broaden this student community?

20/05/23, 16:04 - Ananya: Alright, Today we're going to talk about how to find student-centric SMEs in Africa using Google and LinkedIn. Are you familiar with these tools?
20/05/23, 16:21 - Fanwell EWYL22E0900: Alright, yes mem
20/05/23, 16:24 - Ananya: Let's start with Google. When you're searching for student-centric SMEs in Africa, what keywords do you think you should use?
20/05/23, 16:35 - Fanwell EWYL22E0900: I can use  '  student centric in africa
20/05/23, 16:37 - Ananya: Yes, That's a good start. You could also try "student-centered SMEs in Africa" or "African startups focused on education". However while searching do not forget to consider the following points:
20/05/23, 16:38 - Ananya: 1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.â€‹
20/05/23, 16:38 - Ananya: Now, I want you to search for five companies before our next session, on google. Congratulations on completing today's session! I'm proud of the effort you put in and the progress you made. Let's keep that momentum going and look forward to our next session on Friday during your reserved slot. I'm excited to see what more we can accomplish together!

It is crucial that you are attentive and responsive during our discussion. Quick and timely replies are essential because if we are not able to communicate efficiently, it may hinder our progress and potentially lead to delays in completing our projects on time.

While I understand that you may have encountered some challenges or issues, I kindly request that you make a sincere effort to be punctual in our future sessions.

29/05/23, 17:16 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.

29/05/23, 18:54 - Fanwell EWYL22E0900: alright, mem, As my understanding on Wednesday lesson,its all about  underrated and underappreciated skills in a work place,especially to us young professionals in our career.Thus call self awareness that skill is recognised by WHO  world Health organisation.And they give us an example of the person who has that  personal awareness like  Mr Barack Obama who has valuing time by deviate the schedule
29/05/23, 18:55 - Ananya: I agree with the sentiment expressed in your statement about self-awareness. Our Wednesday wisdom emphasized the importance of being honest with one's feelings and taking time for self-reflection. For instance, former President Obama dedicated 4-5 hours of his time alone after dinner, which allowed him to delve deeper into self-discovery.
29/05/23, 18:58 - Fanwell EWYL22E0900: Quiet great,also agree with you Mem
