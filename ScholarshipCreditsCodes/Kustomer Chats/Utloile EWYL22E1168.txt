19/05/23, 17:43 - Utloile EWYL22E1168: Greetings
19/05/23, 17:43 - Utloile EWYL22E1168: Is this automated or I didn't quite share the required information.
19/05/23, 18:59 - Utloile EWYL22E1168: So I've read and understood that there could be two types of leaders, a traditional one who only values thriving for the company and a servant leader who is there to serve for the company as is thrives on its own. Ive realised that in actual fact the servant leader yields great results at the end of the day because when all the characteristics mentioned about him or her are presented, everyone in the company works to thrive for the company together with keeping the good relationship that the leader would have set thus the company keeps growing and manifesting.
19/05/23, 23:10 - Ananya: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the Wednesday lesson. It is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.
19/05/23, 23:17 - Utloile EWYL22E1168: It's great to access the humility in every employee.
19/05/23, 23:26 - Ananya: Yes, indeed Utloile!
19/05/23, 23:44 - Utloile EWYL22E1168: I'm glad we agree!
