18/07/22, 17:58 - Wendy EWYL22E0133: Fish farming has undoubtedly become the fastest growing business venture in the agricultural sector. Zimbabwe is a landlocked country and with the high demands of sea food many farmers including the help from the government have resolved to small scale fish farming with the use of man made ponds and dams. Zimbabwe is one of the most dammed country in Southern Africa and is endowed with a pleasantly warm climate making it ideal for the rapid growth of algae and weed which fish feed therefore making this industry thrive. Fish farming is not only a profitable business but has also helped in eradicating malnutrition by providing nutrients like omega 3 and protein which is vital for the growth of the young generation who are the future of this country. It has also impacted in food security by bringing variety to the market as there are a myriad of fish species and combating the shortage of beef since cattle is very susceptible to many diseases like the Foot and Mouth Disease and Nagana. The mackerel fish has been on high demand because it is ideal to feed students in boarding schools and so is bream for many fast food restaurants also serve it since it has become a delicacy for many Zimbabweans. The government has helped farmers in various ways like providing free education on how to farm fish, giving funds for capital and providing boats and cages and other raw materials that are requisite for this booming industry. The farmers are facing some challenges despite fish being on high demand because of fuel for pumping water and transportation of fresh fish due to the increase in fuel prices by the local governing board of ZERA. They say that it has highly impacted their profits making this business futile especially if you have a farm that is very far from your market. The country is now seeking funds from non governmental organisations like Fish4ACP and also to help them so researches on how to improve the production of fish.
