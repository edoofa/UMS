28/11/23, 16:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Have you share that in your class group?
28/11/23, 17:16 - Emmanuel EWYL23E0171: I don't have a class group
28/11/23, 17:28 - Saloni Rastogi: So for community building:
1) Keep the group updated DAILY.
2) Try reaching out to students from different schools
3) Try reaching out to teachers from your school or others and ask them to share the link to your WhatsApp group with other school teachers from different schools
4) In the group just:
-please give 'only admins' access
-just ask the students/participants to DM you to know about Edoofa and to get the form
-once they DM you, share about Edoofa with them
-Before sharing the form, ask them to get you added to their school groups
-once they do that, then only share the form with them.‚Äã
‚Äã5) Use social media as your sword to tell people about Edoofa
6) Use Facebook groups, I am sharing a screenshot that will help you understand that there are various scholarship groups on Facebook that you can join and share information about Edoofa also forward the link to your WhatsApp group there.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts.
