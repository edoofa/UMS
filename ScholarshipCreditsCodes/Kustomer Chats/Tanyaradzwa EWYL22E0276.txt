28/07/22, 23:19 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL22E0276: About the document on time management. My understanding is that good time management is to use time productively and efficiently. I learn that something urgent the task may not matter and and something important task matters by not doing them they may be consequences. So a good time manager knows the differ between these two urgent and important because it is the key to priorities time
29/07/22, 00:52 - Unknown: Greetings Tanyaradzwa!
How's your day going?
29/07/22, 00:52 - Unknown: Your response to the Wednesday wisdom has made me realize our childhood quote  is Money'.
Through Wednesday Wisdom, my main aim was to educate my Edoofians about TIME MANAGEMENT and HOW IT CAN BE ACHIEVED.
You know are very well aware of what Time management means, let me tell you about what Time Management includes:

#Effective Planning
# Setting goals and objectives
# Setting deadlines
# Delegation of responsibilities
# Prioritizing activities as per their importance
# Spending the right time on the right activity

The benefits of Time Management are:
- Time Management makes an individual punctual and disciplined.
- One becomes more organized as a result of effective Time Management.
- Individuals who stick to a time plan are the ones who realize their goals and objectives within the shortest possible period. 
- Research says that individuals who accomplish tasks on time are less prone to stress and anxiety. 

How can we achieve it:
# Set a goal for yourself.
# Priority matrix (like we talked about in the Wednesday lesson)
# Do a SWOT Analysis of yourself.

I am sure you will note all these things and imply in your day-to-day life and do share with me what changes you have felt.

How did your weekend go?
02/08/22, 00:41 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL22E0276: The weekend was grt ma'am
02/08/22, 00:41 - Unknown: A timetable is a framework that lets individuals see specific activities lined up. In this framework, it shows the tie allotment among several tasks and courses. It ensures equal distribution of time among activities and subjects, creates a smooth workflow, prevents wasting of time and efforts, and aids in creating good habits.
The *weekend activity* asked you to draw a timetable for yourself and of course, have time for your scheduled sessions as well.
I am really excited to see your timetable here and of course, we can discuss how we can manage our sessions accordingly.
In this session today, we will discuss:
1. your timetable (as a part of the weekend activity)
2. progress on community building projects
02/08/22, 00:42 - Unknown: Let me share with you the format of the timetable.
02/08/22, 00:47 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL22E0276: So what am I supposed to do
02/08/22, 00:49 - Unknown: I see you have not received the weekend activity Tanyaradzwa might be some glitch. I am sorry for this.
02/08/22, 00:50 - Unknown: I will share the activity with you now.
02/08/22, 00:50 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL22E0276: OK ma'am
02/08/22, 00:50 - Unknown: A well-constructed timetable establishes a natural rhythm and routine, which can be comforting students as well as their mentors. Having a plan as a learner is very important as it helps you maximize and prioritize on the things that are of urgency or importance. Most students do not have an organized study plan and if they do, they fail to follow the plan drawn. As the Wednesday Wisdom offered advice on how to use our time wisely. You must share your daily schedules with your mentors as part of your Saturday activity in the format that has been provided to you. I've given you the image of a timetable; you can draw it on paper and show it to your mentors. Do not forget to provide the scheduled time for your EWYL programme.
02/08/22, 00:52 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL22E0276: OK now I understand ma'am
02/08/22, 00:53 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL22E0276: So is okay if I record it tomorrow
