And till now, our founder Mr. Angad has always been a guiding light for everyone at Edoofa. And has made sure we all turn out to be future leaders in our fields, no matter how hard it seems, we should keep moving with single harmony toward our goals and motives. But, leadership can not only be taught, as it is not a literary subject, but a practical life experience that is to be taken up and practiced and bettered with each passing day.

Hence, after the very encouraging Wednesday lesson on how good leadership and patience can change the entire ideology and perception of a community to grow back from the ashes. Today's Activity is going to give you a first-hand experience to fit yourselves in a small part of the leadership shoes. I want you to create a newsletter of your own. Similar to the ones you have enjoyed reading every Sunday from the founder's office.

Your Newsletter should consider the following things:  Quotes that have been motivating you for some time now, or your three favorite quotes which motivate you to be better every day.
and,
2. One story of your idol, that can be any person, who according to you has contributed to making the community and world a better place for people to live. The story should also consist of a part stating the reason why they are your idol.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own capabilities while performing this activity.

The best newsletters of the week shall be shared with all the fellow edoofians next week.

Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their personality traits made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.

How are you?

The Wednesday lesson taught us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, _disability_. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition.

In our session, we will discuss:
1) your understanding of how disability is different from what we thought about it earlier
2) progress on the projects
17/11/22, 22:58 - Unknown: I am doing well, thanks for asking.
18/11/22, 01:54 - ANESU EWYL22E0608: Well from today's lesson I have understood that disability does not hinder one way to dream big rather it gives more new ideas of bigger dreams ?
18/11/22, 01:54 - ANESU EWYL22E0608: Sorry I am unable to cope up with you these days l am a bit tied up with my driving lessons

How are you?
19/11/22, 01:10 - Unknown: Most people with disabilities can list one by one the times they have encountered abnormal obstacles when trying to achieve each one of the normal goals like  their textbooks, materials, and classrooms; finding a rewarding job paying a living wage or owning a business; etc.
I firmly believe that we must remove this mindset from people around us and from our heads too that 'disability' doesn't mean that they are different.
What I feel is that disability is the new normal now!

Your response is also mind-opening and should be shared with everyone.
