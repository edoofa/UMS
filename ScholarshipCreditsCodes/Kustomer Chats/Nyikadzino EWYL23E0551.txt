18/09/23, 13:14 - Unknown: Good afternoon Nyikadzino, I hope you're doing well today. It's always a pleasure to connect with you for our sessions. 🌟
18/09/23, 13:15 - Unknown: From next time make sure you are available for our sessions two minutes prior to the scheduled timing.
This will ensure more efficiency and productivity in our work.
18/09/23, 13:15 - Nyikadzino EWYL23E0551: Done
18/09/23, 13:19 - Nyikadzino EWYL23E0551: Goodmorning, Noted
18/09/23, 13:19 - Unknown: Fantastic! Let's make this session a productive one. To begin, I'd like to hear about your Saturday activity. Could you please share your responses for the same ?
18/09/23, 13:20 - Unknown: I realized, I did not share the saturday activiy with you because our conversation was locked.
18/09/23, 13:20 - Unknown: Now, let's shift attention to the three projects we've been discussing, particularly the

Community Building and African School Reforms initiatives.
18/09/23, 13:21 - Unknown: Could you provide an update on the Community Building project? What progress have you made?
18/09/23, 13:25 - Nyikadzino EWYL23E0551: I'm regards to my Community building project u realized that most of the students who are about to write their A'level studies are currently in school and and do not have access to phones . I was able to reach out to a few of my former classmates but I haven't gotten any proper responses as of yet
18/09/23, 13:28 - Nyikadzino EWYL23E0551: I prefer studying alone as I believe I understand and take in a lot more information when alone , whereas when the need arises for group study I will not hesitate as I'll learn from other students perspective which might make the subject simple to work on
18/09/23, 13:28 - Unknown: Okay Nyikadzino. Expanding your community-building project and effectively engaging with students can be achieved through a well-thought-out plan:
18/09/23, 13:29 - Unknown: If possible, arrange in-person meetings at schools, local libraries, or  community centers. Create a schedule that works for students, perhaps  after school hours or on weekends.
18/09/23, 13:30 - Unknown: Try having conversations with parents to discuss the project's benefits and encourage their support. They can help facilitate communication with their children, even if students lack direct phone access.
18/09/23, 13:31 - Unknown: Nyikadzino, have you encountered any challenges that require my attention? I'm curious to hear your perspective on the project's current status.
18/09/23, 13:35 - Nyikadzino EWYL23E0551: I will try to use  that approach effectively
18/09/23, 13:38 - Unknown: That is great! In these sessions do come up with difficulties that you are facing and we will solve the problems together. 
But our main goal is to master the communication, social and persuasion skills along with making sure we are earning enough scholarship credits.
18/09/23, 13:38 - Nyikadzino EWYL23E0551: From the few classmates that I talked to I sensed a sort of resistance . I think as I proceed to tell them more about  the Edoofa Program they will warm to the idea
18/09/23, 13:38 - Nyikadzino EWYL23E0551: I understand
18/09/23, 13:42 - Unknown: That is a challenge that arrives in the very beginning. In such a scenario you should explain about your journey with Edoofa and then you can speak about the benefits and assistance that you and other Edoofians get and will be getting throughout their college journey.

You can also give fee comparisons specially when it comes to studying abroad.
18/09/23, 13:43 - Nyikadzino EWYL23E0551: I understand ..
18/09/23, 13:45 - Unknown: I went through your Saturday activity response, and I also agree with you that one should have discussion in group when needed and also should opt for self-study.

Adopting both these ways definitely ensure more efficiency.
18/09/23, 13:46 - Nyikadzino EWYL23E0551: Thank you
18/09/23, 13:57 - Unknown: You are welcome!
18/09/23, 13:58 - Unknown: Now, turning our attention to the African School Reforms project. Could you share your insights on the current state of this project?
18/09/23, 14:00 - Nyikadzino EWYL23E0551: I got intouch with my former school they said they would get back to me during this week as we were approaching the weekend when I reached out
18/09/23, 14:02 - Unknown: That is good. Make sure you are visiting them for a follow up today only.
18/09/23, 14:03 - Unknown: See, in all these projects all you need is consistent efforts.
18/09/23, 14:03 - Unknown: do you foresee any potential difficulties that might affect your progress in this project?
18/09/23, 14:06 - Nyikadzino EWYL23E0551: As of now i don't foresee any potential difficulties
18/09/23, 14:09 - Unknown: Okay Nyikadzino. So, before our next session I expect at least 5 school forms from you.

4. Personal Outreach: Encourage one-on-one conversations with classmates, friends, and acquaintances, explaining how Edoofa can assist them in their educational journey.
18/09/23, 14:15 - Unknown: 7. Time Management: Allocate specific hours each day or week for outreach and follow-ups. Create a schedule to ensure consistent efforts.

18/09/23, 14:23 - Unknown: Public Speaking Confidence: Explaining your organization to others, whether one-on-one or in larger groups, boosts your confidence in public speaking. This skill is invaluable in various aspects of life and career.
18/09/23, 14:23 - Unknown: Problem-Solving: Engaging with the community often  involves addressing questions or concerns. This nurtures your  problem-solving skills as you find solutions to potential obstacles.
18/09/23, 14:23 - Unknown: Leadership Development: Taking the initiative to  connect and share your organization's mission positions you as a leader  within your community. This leadership experience can open doors to new  opportunities and responsibilities.
18/09/23, 14:24 - Unknown: Objectivity of the Goal: 
Connecting with others in the community to explain your organization is not just about promoting your cause; it's about fostering a sense of community, addressing needs, and making a positive impact. Your objective is to create a win-win situation where both you and the community benefit.
18/09/23, 14:26 - Nyikadzino EWYL23E0551: I understand
18/09/23, 14:26 - Unknown: That is really good Nyikadzino.
