Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

It means the willpower to work hard regardless of any obstacles, to be firm on achieving, and remaining consistent.
consistency is key to building trust – be that in your professional or personal relationships. This trust, in turn, leads to long-term stability, which is characterised by both parties feeling valued, supported, secure and/or loved.Consistency is a combination of behaviors that include dependability, trust, and a true desire to have a companion and form a serious relationship.” Catchings adds, “People who are more consistent with their interactions with one another, such as having predictable behaviors and good communication, have longer and healthier relationships with people
