09/12/23, 19:08 - Jasmine Kaur: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

29/12/23, 22:40 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Evening Ariel
Let us start today's session with a fun question -

If you could create a new country on any unclaimed land in the world, what would you name it, and what values or principles would be the foundation of your utopian society?
29/12/23, 22:57 - Ariel EWYL23E0815: I would name it Loveworld Nation
The values are derived from its name. It will be a country of building a healthier and happier world with Love ‚ù§.
Once love abides in a nation , cruelty, hate, malice, corruption and evil deeds are automatically dissolved by love for one another. 
Thank you for the opportunity to share my mind.
29/12/23, 22:58 - Jasmine Kaur: "LoveWorld Nation" is a beautifully named society, and the values you've associated with it‚Äîbuilding a healthier and happier world through love‚Äîare deeply meaningful. I am impressed.

I learnt about goal setting and having a growth mindset

Thats one of the nuggets I got from the lesson
