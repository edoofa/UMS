18/01/23, 17:10 - Unknown: Greetings Isheanotida!
How are you?
18/01/23, 17:16 - Unknown: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
18/01/23, 17:16 - Unknown: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
18/01/23, 17:17 - Unknown: Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
18/01/23, 17:18 - Unknown: Are you ready?
18/01/23, 18:32 - Isheanotida EWYL22E0578: Yes l Am ready
18/01/23, 18:32 - Isheanotida EWYL22E0578: l Am a proud Edoofian
18/01/23, 18:34 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

21/01/23, 21:40 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

A college student named Rachel was unsure of what career path to pursue after graduation. She talked to several professionals in different fields, but none of them seemed to fit her interests and skills. One day, she had a conversation with a mentor who asked her the right questions, such as \"What are you passionate about?\" and \"What do you enjoy doing in your free time?\" Rachel realized that her true passion was writing and storytelling. She decided to pursue a career in journalism and landed a job at a top news outlet.

We gained knowledge on how to ask intelligent questions. I'd like you to share with us any two questions you'd like to ask yourself as part of your Saturday submission. The questions that you may have been hesitant to make, the questions that put you in a difficult situation, the inquiries that will have a significant impact on your career and future. For example:  1. What is the limit of my current capabilities and how can I push beyond them to continue learning and growing?\"
2. “How can I ensure that my actions align with my values and contribute to the greater good, rather than just maximizing my own success?\"

Looking forward to your response!
21/01/23, 21:40 - Unknown: Please make a note of the following things:
1) No response will be accepted on the EWYL Group, it has to be done on the EWYL Line only.
2) I believe that you are aware that every morning you wake up, you need to follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' on the EWYL Line only. This ritual helps in keeping the family connected.
3) From now on, you have to reach out to me at your scheduled time of the session. In case you have not shared your activity\/lesson response to be within one hour of your scheduled session, I will mark that as a missed session and just to inform you that such a performance can go to the direct notice of the Academic Board of Edoofa under the defaulters' list. Make sure that you are punctual.
