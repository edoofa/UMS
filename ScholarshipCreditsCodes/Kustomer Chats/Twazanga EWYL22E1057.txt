19/05/23, 19:06 - Twazanga EWYL22E1057: LEADERSHIP 
Throughout history, leaders play important roles in society with include providing direction, implementing plans and motivating people.

SERVANT LEADERSHIP 
This is a leadership philosophy in which the goal of the leader is to serve. Instead dog the people working to serve the leader, the leader exists to serve the people. Some important characteristics of servant leaders were highlighted, and these include; listening, empathy, healing, awareness, persuasion, conceptualization, foresight, stewardship, commitment to the growth of people and building community. These skills have been sighted to be upheld by Mr Angad Singh and Mr Avreen Singh, the cofounders of the Edoofa Scholarship program.
19/05/23, 23:07 - Ananya: Wow, Twazanga you look very nice. Did you like the T-shirt?
19/05/23, 23:07 - Ananya: Also, Thank you for sharing your understanding of the Wednesday lesson. It is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.
20/05/23, 01:06 - Twazanga EWYL22E1057: Thank you very much Ms Ananya ‚ù§Ô∏è
Yes I do like the shirt!
20/05/23, 01:06 - Twazanga EWYL22E1057: Indeed ma‚Äôam!
23/05/23, 13:18 - Twazanga EWYL22E1057: Good morning my lovely mentor ‚ù§Ô∏è
23/05/23, 13:28 - Twazanga EWYL22E1057: The EWYL program has been so beneficial to me as an aspiring future leader. I have learnt so many valuable and fruitful skills that I will put into practical use so as to help me become an influential servant leader. Becoming a leader in the Edoofa student community would be a bridge that can lead me to greater heights in the society.
One of the skills I would highly prioritize is self awareness. I would like to learn my strengths and weaknesses, so that I can manage my emotions well and impart positivity and a good example to my fellow students.
Another skill I‚Äôd love to prioritize is conceptualization. I‚Äôd like to develop a long term goal term goal which can help me stay focused and motivated to achieve distant goals. I would also like to be the one to create mission and vision statements for my team.
I would also prioritize stewardship. I would aim at being responsible and accountable for the performance of all the team players of my group.
All in all, I will aim at eventually mastering all the skilled that I will need to become a successful servant leader.

24/05/23, 16:35 - Ananya: To connect with these schools, you can use LinkedIn. Other than that, you can also call them by searching the contact numbers from Google.
24/05/23, 16:35 - Ananya: Yes, you can use the same format.

24/05/23, 16:40 - Twazanga EWYL22E1057: Alright ma‚Äôam
24/05/23, 16:50 - Ananya: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian!
Hope are doing well.

‚ÄúWhen I discover who I am, I'll be free.‚Äù ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.

26/05/23, 17:15 - Twazanga EWYL22E1057: I am a proud EDOOFIAN
26/05/23, 17:16 - Ananya: Hello everyone! Our latest post on the Edoofa Instagram page is something you definitely wouldn't want to miss. Please visit our page to take a look and feel free to share your own opinions in the comments section.

26/05/23, 18:07 - Twazanga EWYL22E1057: Unfortunately I‚Äôm having a challenge with power, my phone needs to be charged and there‚Äôs no power. I will send my understanding of the Wednesday lesson later in the evening as well and feedback from my reports. Can we reschedule today‚Äôs meeting?
26/05/23, 18:49 - Ananya: That is alright, dear!
26/05/23, 22:27 - Twazanga EWYL22E1057: Self awareness 
Being self aware involves identifying your emotions, seeing yourself honestly, recognizing your strengths and weaknesses, and having the plan to work towards them. An example of the former president of the USA Barrack Obama was cited as he gives great example of how he creates time daily to just discipline himself and reflect on how he can be more productive. 
We are being told to list down our strengths and characteristics that help us be more productive. We are also being asked to mention the traits of personality that become a hindrance in our productivity.
29/05/23, 17:35 - Twazanga EWYL22E1057: I am a proud EDOOFIAN
29/05/23, 17:35 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
29/05/23, 17:38 - Twazanga EWYL22E1057: That‚Äôs a very encouraging story there
