I hope you are well
27/06/23, 16:37 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
27/06/23, 16:37 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
27/06/23, 16:37 - Saloni Rastogi: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *12:00-01:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.

27/06/23, 16:39 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: Alright
28/06/23, 15:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

Team EWYL

28/06/23, 15:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'.
28/06/23, 15:54 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, may I know which project will you undertake in the coming weeks and how will you work on it?
28/06/23, 17:43 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: Good Afternoon Ms.Saloni
I apologize for any inconvenience i may have cause as I thought we would start the lesson on Thursday but i have read the above notice and i have just started to read the story
28/06/23, 18:21 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: I have understood that the story is about a boy named Alex who lived in a town called Successville , who after stumbling upon a book abandoned on a park bench ,was able to realize how success comes from embracing the process of becoming who you aspire to be. 
The title of the book read "The Power of Identity-Based Habits.The discovery of the book changed his life forever As Alex was able to learn  about the concept of identity-based habits. The book explained that instead of basing only on external goals, one should concentrate on becoming the person one aspires to be. The key was to align one's habits with their desired identity.
Alex was captivated by this idea. He realized that  he had never truly thought about the person he wanted to become instead only on winning competitions and having good grades .He began by envisioning his ideal self‚Äîthe person who was disciplined and focused.Eventually he started transforming his habits, in which he found joy in the process of understanding new concepts .He embraced challenges as opportunities for growth, rather than as obstacles to be avoided.
As Alex's habits aligned with his desired identity,he  no longer worried about short-term outcomes and eventually helped his friends to see things the way he did which seemed to be better.The moral of the story is that success lies not only in the achievement of external goals but also in the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. By aligning one‚Äôs habits with their desired identity.

29/06/23, 15:45 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: I hope you are well Ms Saloni
29/06/23, 15:46 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: Thank you as well for sharing such a wonderful story with me
29/06/23, 15:46 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: Thank you maam
29/06/23, 15:47 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: Yes i did
29/06/23, 16:11 - Saloni Rastogi: I am sharing standard information with you for the grant document shared yesterday. Make sure you have your full attention.
29/06/23, 16:11 - Saloni Rastogi: In these 21 days, I want that we engage in the best possible manner to bring out fruitful results.

So this time you have to be *REGULAR IN YOUR SESSIONS*


Before we begin, let's go over what a complete session involves. üìö

‚ñ™Ô∏è First of all, you have to *come to the EWYL LINE every single day and tell me HOW PROUD ARE YOU being an Edoofian* (Including Sundays and even on days you don't have your session). This means _following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' without fail on the EWYL Line._

‚ñ™Ô∏è Secondly, It's essential to *arrive on time for the session*, as being late will not be considered as attending a session. _This brings the importance of being punctual for the session._

‚ñ™Ô∏è During our sessions, we'll cover two key topics: the *Wednesday Lesson or Weekend Activity* and *Project Updates*


To ensure your progress, I will ask for your Lessons or Activities submissions during the session. It's essential to be prepared and ready to share your work when prompted.üéì
29/06/23, 16:11 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: Alright
29/06/23, 16:13 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: Noted Maam
29/06/23, 16:13 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: Ive read and understood
29/06/23, 16:23 - Saloni Rastogi: Now, let's talk about a challenge that is included in the above-mentioned Project Update! ‚úàÔ∏è
I have set a target for the next 21 days, which involves sharing:


*45 Community Building forms*
and
*2 School Connect forms*


To mark a session as completed, your active presence is required throughout our session time. If you encounter any network or mobile issues, I recommend addressing them beforehand so that we can make the most of our time together.

Remember, excuses won't be accepted because I believe in your determination.
29/06/23, 16:25 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: Alright
29/06/23, 16:25 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: Understood maam
29/06/23, 16:28 - Saloni Rastogi: Coming to the point that you might have also noticed and something that brings a flavor to this challenge is Extra Curricular activity


When it comes to overall assessment and evaluation, we believe it's not just about projects and lessons. It's about how passionate you are about yourself. Therefore, there is another aspect for evaluation, which is extracurricular activities.

In the next 21 days, It's your turn to show your amazing talent and be better than all the other students in this thrilling competition. Show everyone what you can do and make them amazed by your skills.

As your mentor, I want you to tell me about what else you are good at besides academics and share your idea of how you will showcase that talent to us.
29/06/23, 16:32 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: Well okay i am good at creative writing
29/06/23, 16:33 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: I am thinking of how to showcase it to you 
Maybe if possible you can be the one to  help me find a way
29/06/23, 16:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Maybe you can write something that can be presented creatively on our social media page, because your talent will be featured there.
29/06/23, 16:40 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: Alright maam 
Please elaborate further 
Something in the lines  of what exactly?
29/06/23, 16:47 - Saloni Rastogi: It can be in the context of anything that can motivate people around you or a story that you can make with creative images like shown in comic books, with this I mean creative illustration.
29/06/23, 16:48 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: Alright
29/06/23, 16:48 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: I understand

03/07/23, 15:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self‚Äîthe person you aspire to be‚Äîand consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!

05/07/23, 15:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you please share your Weekend activity response along with project update?
05/07/23, 16:02 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: Alright maam
05/07/23, 16:44 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: The Pdf ,It speaks on how Consistency is the key to making progress and achieving long term goals.Which is also the same as in academics or fitness, consistent in it will yield better outcomes compared to sporadic efforts.Also it enlightens on how Consistency enhances ones credibility and reliability in the eyes of others. When people notice you being able to delivering on your promises over and over again or consistently displaying a certain behavior, they develop trust in you. Where as inconsistency creates doubt and erodes trust.
Consistency is also something that establishes good habits ,it is a base  of forming positive habits. When one continuously engages in a behavior, it becomes ingrained and easier to maintain ,such as healthy eating, regular exercise, and the likes.
I also understood that Consistency nurtures perseverance ,as life  is filled with challenges and setbacks. Consistency helps you stay resilient and motivated in the face of obstacles. When you consistently work towards your goals, setbacks become more simple.
As well as how Consistency plays a vital role in building and maintaining healthy relationships. Consistently showing up for others, being reliable, and demonstrating consistent care and respect fosters trust and deepen connections.
Consistency is seen as a powerful force that propels us toward success. By being consistent in our actions, habits, and commitments, helps us to create positive outcome. Whether it's personal growth or professional endeavors, the power of consistency cannot be underestimated. So, one just has to embrace consistency and witness the transformative impact it can have on your life.
One notable example is of Warren Buffet ad his consistency extends beyond his investment strategy.
05/07/23, 16:46 - Kimberly EWYL23E0247: Weekend activity 
Many children face bad grades,failure to make friends,and also not having the right facilities to study when in school.
Being a student myself i can safely say I have been a witness to it as well.
Through the story of Alex i can mention how i was able to gain an understanding,this is even through the lack of any motivation that me wonder exactly how I would work toward passing my studies.However Self motivation actually seemed to have been a turn as it pushed me to work harder and build a better foundation for myself and to make my family proud and happy.Ofcourse determination alone is a large push factor and it would also make my own family feel the urge to succeed.
Throughout the whole time that one pushes themself to succeed it draws their loved ones and strings them along thus through me staying strong and determined it served hope for my family and friends
