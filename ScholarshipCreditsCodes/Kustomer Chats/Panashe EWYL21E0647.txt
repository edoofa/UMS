14/07/22, 05:04 - Panashe EWYL21E0647: Good morning Sir I am proud Edoofian
14/07/22, 05:06 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Under Strength mining has lowest cost in Zimbabwe, it is very reliable, mining industry has values and bestowed with significant minerals resources available on the earth to go for. it can prove to be fast growing lndustry with mineral exports responsible for 60% of the country's export earning

Weaknesses
Mining can lead to soil pollution, Ground water pollution, also deforestation ,Due to over mining there will be depletion of natural resources .lt implies the destruction of habbits and loss of biodiversity

Opportunities
There are mining investors from other countries, minining beneficiation, long term capital , employment opportunities and gold buying agents

Threats
Mining threatens wildlife ,scared sites And people .For example we have an National park in Hwange at the same time coal is mined in Hwange again.Miners can be affected their hearing .However , its overbearingly negative environmental impacts outweigh the socioeconomic benefits. Moreso, air pollution and land degradation are common in areas where such mining is carried out

How are you doing
25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
