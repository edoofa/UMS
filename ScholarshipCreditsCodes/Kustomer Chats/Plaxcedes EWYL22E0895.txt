19/08/23, 13:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

Get ready to embark on a journey of creativity as for today's Saturday Activity you have the opportunity to craft a short story based on one of the following three values:

1. Perseverance:
Write about a character who faces obstacles and perseveres to achieve success. Show their journey as they conquer adversity and emerge stronger.

2. Diversity and Inclusion:
Feature characters from different backgrounds, initially in conflict due to their differences. Show how their relationships evolve as they learn to value and celebrate each other's perspectives.

3. Gratitude:
Follow a character who learns to appreciate life's beauty and express gratitude for the people and experiences that enrich their life. Explore their growth as they foster appreciation and inspire others.

Choose a value that resonates with you. Your words can evoke emotions and leave a lasting impression. We eagerly await your creative stories that reflect the values shaping our lives.

Happy writing!
28/08/23, 17:49 - Plaxcedes EWYL22E0895: There was two different groups of religion appeared iny society the one called Christianity and the other Muslim . Christianity believed in the Holy Trinity that is the father , the son  and the holy spirit while Muslims believed in Allah as their only God , Muhammad as their prophet and the Quran as thei holly book . With these different itepretations these religions tend to accuse one another for being satanism where viewing their religoin as superior than the other thus they tend to quarel each time they meet . Christianity usually criricise the shariah law in lslam as oppressing women yet to muslim believers it appeared normal to tgem because following it perpetuates peace and oder in lslamic societies . However when these two get to know that they believe in one existing God even though they called him with different names but still have the same meaning to all the religions therefore they reconciled . The society now have nomore misunderstandings knowing that they serve the only one God .
