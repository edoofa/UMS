28/09/23, 13:14 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: Yes please
28/09/23, 13:14 - Aditi Kapoor: Let's begin by exploring your understanding of the lesson on Wednesday.
28/09/23, 13:18 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: On Wednesday we talked about time management and it's importance. Time management can help maximize productivity by accomplishing more at a short period of time. It also reduces stress and it helps one in achieving goals in time.
28/09/23, 13:22 - Aditi Kapoor: Amazing Ivy.
28/09/23, 13:22 - Aditi Kapoor: Alright, so now let's have  a discussion on your project's?
28/09/23, 13:23 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: Alright
28/09/23, 13:24 - Aditi Kapoor: So let's begin with your plan of action, so please brief me about the same.
28/09/23, 13:26 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: I was guided by my mentor to reach out to my previous school principal to talk about Edoofa program and I did. He saw my messages but he did not write back so I'm looking for another school that I can approach to talk about the same
28/09/23, 13:30 - Aditi Kapoor: It's great that you proactively reached out to your previous school principal to discuss the Edoofa program. While it's unfortunate that you didn't receive a response.
28/09/23, 13:31 - Aditi Kapoor: So in this case you can try to visit your school if that is possible and explain the Edoofa scholarship program to the headmaster.
28/09/23, 13:31 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: I would like that but it's too far from where I live. Is it possible to try other schools close to me?
28/09/23, 13:33 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, in this case, you can keep exploring other opportunities and avenues.
28/09/23, 13:33 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: That is great
28/09/23, 13:34 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes Ivy and what about the community building project?
28/09/23, 13:38 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: I am yet to form a group. It's also hard to find students Willing to learn. But I have found a few who want to pursue post graduate studies
28/09/23, 13:40 - Aditi Kapoor: Wow, this is amazing.
You can also reach out to the students who want to pursue graduation, diploma courses and even Ph.D.
28/09/23, 13:41 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: Amazing
I will do Just that.
28/09/23, 13:42 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, and also try to figure out what are the aspirations of the students and then try to guide them for the right path towards quality education
28/09/23, 13:43 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: I will also do that
28/09/23, 13:43 - Aditi Kapoor: Great!
Because I hope that you are aware of the opportunities that lie here in India.
28/09/23, 13:44 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: Yes I am aware
28/09/23, 13:52 - Aditi Kapoor: Great!
So can you list 5 benefits of studying in India?

04/10/23, 12:30 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: Done
04/10/23, 13:54 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofians,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning

05/10/23, 13:09 - Aditi Kapoor: Good morning!
I trust you're in excellent condition.

So, are you prepared to commence our session?
05/10/23, 13:10 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: Good morning
I am well thank you. I hope you are too
05/10/23, 13:10 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: Yes I am
05/10/23, 13:13 - Aditi Kapoor: Superb!
05/10/23, 13:16 - Aditi Kapoor: So I hope you have had the chance to understand the Wednesday Lesson, and I am intrigued to know what mental changes will you make so that you may control your circumstances rather than letting them control you.
05/10/23, 13:19 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: Yes I have
Emotional well being contributes to one's productivity
05/10/23, 13:20 - Aditi Kapoor: Ivy would you like to share with me an elaborated answer as I would like to know more about your though process and ultimate goal.
05/10/23, 13:26 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: The way I understand the Wednesday's wisdom is that a sense of belongingness is important because it brings the support one needs, motivation, emotional well-being, accountability, just to mention a few. In this case, a sense of belonging in the Edoofa community brings in the idea that one is not a lot and there are people supporting them on the side which is nice to be a part of something to achieve said goals
05/10/23, 13:29 - Aditi Kapoor: You've captured the essence of Wednesday's wisdom quite well. A sense of belongingness does indeed encompass critical elements like support, motivation, emotional well-being, and accountability. It creates the comforting notion that you're not alone and that there are others backing you up on your journey, which is a valuable aspect of being part of a community like Edoofa.
05/10/23, 13:30 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: Yes, exactly
05/10/23, 13:33 - Aditi Kapoor: May I know the update on the School project were you able to get a reply from the school headmaster?
05/10/23, 13:38 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: No 
I still wasn't able to do that.
I tried reaching out to the schools in my community but the majority can't afford to be on the program mostly because of financial issues. I am based in a very rural area
05/10/23, 13:43 - Aditi Kapoor: Alright, can you please elaborate on the affordability that are they finding  the term fees of studying in India expensive or any other form.
05/10/23, 13:45 - Aditi Kapoor: Also, if your school head hasn't replied to you try reaching out to a teacher or an in-charge who can help you connect with your school headmaster.
05/10/23, 13:46 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: I'm sorry, can you please rephrase this?
05/10/23, 13:46 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: That is a good idea
I will try that
05/10/23, 13:47 - Aditi Kapoor: Sure so could you explain if they think the cost of studying in India is high, or if there's some other aspect of it that concerns them?
05/10/23, 13:50 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: No, they don't think it's high. They think it's fair but they still can't afford it since most of the student's parents don't have a reliable source of income to support them financially
05/10/23, 14:04 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, Ivy, I got that point and I appreciate the amount of effort you have put in so I would like to tell you that you have to just establish a connection with the school and get the form filled scheduling  call with Edoofa Program director and about the issue of affordability we have multiple new plan and schemes and scholarship to help make quality education in India affordable so you and the school authorities need not worry about that.
I hope you got my point.
05/10/23, 14:05 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: Yes I have
I will certainly do that
05/10/23, 14:06 - Aditi Kapoor: Perfect!
05/10/23, 14:16 - Aditi Kapoor: Great!

Now moving on to the discussion of the community - building project, may I know if you were able to reach out to your peers?
05/10/23, 14:17 - Ivy EWYL23E0656: Yes I did that too. Some were interested and some not
05/10/23, 14:19 - Aditi Kapoor: So were you able to get the offline application form filled of those who were interested?
