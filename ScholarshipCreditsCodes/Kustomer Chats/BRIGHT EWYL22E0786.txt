17/12/22, 21:34 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, 
_I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?_

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!
17/12/22, 23:17 - BRIGHT EWYL22E0786: Thank you
18/12/22, 01:53 - BRIGHT EWYL22E0786: I would like to be my mother's secret santa. I want to give her a very nice thank you present. It might not be expensive but it is from the bottom of my heart. I will give her a hair dryer as a present to take care of her of hair as she loves it. My mother have always been on my side everytime and I am very grateful for that. No matter where I am or how grown I have become she is always giving me much attention, great support and she has always been loving and caring. At times I get mad at her but she always forgives me no matter what. Honestly she always attempts to make me feel protected and happy without money and she is always successful on that. My mother has taught me good manners, appreciation, gratitude, honesty, humanity and to always believe in myself. I want to thank my mother for trying to teach me to be neat and tidy, even though it did not work. Most importantly my mom taught me to always see the best in people and to be diplomatic in the face of conflict, and when I had no choice but to fight, to fight fair. She has always been my friend, the person I share my problems with and the person I am more than relieved to talk to. Truly speaking words and gifts cannot express how grateful I feel towards her for everything she does for me.

In this webinar not only business ideations and strategies will be discussed but also brand development, moreover, our featured industry professional is profound in advertising, content marketing, and marketing research too. Who knows, something might catch your eye or let you discover your field of interest by just listening to the different structures of a company. I would genuinely implore you to give this a chance and see for yourself whether the seats we worth taking.
