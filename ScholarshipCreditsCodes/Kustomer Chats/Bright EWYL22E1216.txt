These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

The feedback we have received from some of you on this week’s Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.
As part of this week’s Saturday Activity, you are required to share your written submission on : 
What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?
There is no word limit, so feel free to express your understanding in detail. The second answer requires some mental work, so sit with yourself, introspect, and share your honest answer with your mentor. 
Let this activity play an important role in your personal goal setting. We will connect soon in our upcoming session. 
Till then, happy learning and happy growing!
11/03/23, 23:54 - Aditi Kapoor: Let me share with you the star performers for this week, I applaud them for their amazing performance in the following projects:

This week's Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the topic of \"Seeking Wealth, not Money or Status.\" This is an important lesson that will provide valuable insights into the pursuit of financial stability and success. During this lesson, we will explore the concept of wealth and its importance in building a sustainable financial future. We will discuss the difference between wealth, money, and status, and how each of these concepts plays a role in our lives.
I encourage you to read the lesson in detail and take notes to fully understand the material. It is important to engage with this topic and think critically about your own financial goals and aspirations.
By understanding the importance of seeking wealth over money or status, you can develop a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial success. I look forward to exploring this topic with you in more detail during our upcoming lesson.

27/03/23, 21:02 - Aditi Kapoor: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

27/03/23, 21:19 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

As informed earlier, I was not available last week from Thursday to Friday and the organization was closed on Saturday and Sunday. So let's focus today's session solely on these three things:

1) Wednesday lesson + Weekend activity understanding
2) Whether you were able to complete last week's Projects targets?
3) What are the challenges you are facing in the projects?

Also, this week will be visiting our _Proud Indian Edoofians_ from Wednesday to Saturday. So, the sessions will be held at that time. And I will be very happy to share the updates of our visit with you as the days go by?
27/03/23, 21:23 - Bright EWYL22E1216: I'm going to start with my challenges. 
* School stuff was hectic , but I am coping
* Mere ignorance by some peers 
* Network challenges in the region i am in
27/03/23, 23:09 - Aditi Kapoor: No worries, let's start from scratch.
27/03/23, 23:10 - Aditi Kapoor: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/03/23, 23:10 - Aditi Kapoor: A] Through WhatsApp community groups:


STEP 1: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME\/MENTOR NAME\/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED
For eg: In your case it will be-
Bright\/Saloni\/27MAR2023
27/03/23, 23:11 - Aditi Kapoor: STEP 2: We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
27/03/23, 23:11 - Aditi Kapoor: Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
27/03/23, 23:11 - Aditi Kapoor: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
27/03/23, 23:11 - Aditi Kapoor: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to at least 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
28/03/23, 01:45 - Bright EWYL22E1216: Okay , I got it
29/03/23, 01:09 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Bright!
How are you?
29/03/23, 01:09 - Aditi Kapoor: Please excuse me for the delayed response, I was occupied in an internal meeting with the team with was to be attended as a priority about our visit starting tomorrow till Saturday.
As informed, no sessions will be held during this time and we will begin afresh from next week onwards where I will be sharing some crazy and interesting insights with you.
But this will only be done, we you will NOT MISS these *THREE THINGS*:
1) Timely submission of the Wednesday lesson and weekend activity
2) Daily following the ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', the absence of which can lead to not sharing of weekly lessons and activities with you
3) and most importantly, *PROGRESS ON PROJECTS*

I will be tracking the progress on _Monday_.
I completely know that these two weeks, we might not have dedicated discussions on the projects. So in my absence, I want that you think in-depth about *the project you are doing, revising the targets for the same, and completing it*.
I would really be emotional and happy that in a few months, many of the new edoofians will be joining our Indian family here. And honestly, I will be happier that we start preparing now for the future because growth is not measured in one day. We need to work hard consistently and dedicatedly.

Like I always say ‘1 step daily means 1 step UP. 0 step daily means 1 step DOWN’.
I trust you, just believe in yourself.

How are you?
I am sure that we will earn more than $100 this month, it is just that we have to be regular and consistent in our approach toward things.
Don't get disheartened because failure is also a step in the ladder that leads us to success. I am very pumped up to bring out the best in you, we will do great in the month, I know.
Let's connect tomorrow and see what the day holds for us?
For now, I am sharing last week's newsletter with you, I hope you will love reading it.

Our weekly Wednesday wisdom focussed on Napolean Hill's 13 Principles of Success and it deeply talked about 6 such principles that can make you think out of the box.
