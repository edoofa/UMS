03/10/22, 16:10 - Unknown: Hello, my dear Proud Edoofians,

This week we took a step back and reflected upon the objective of the EWYL program. We collectively reflected on why we should be regular with our projects, what these projects will help us earn, and how all of this will result in our individual financial independence.

Today, let's work on the next step which is to plan how to be financially independent by utilizing your time with the right projects. As an activity for this week, I want you to draft a document mentioning:

a)Target- no. of credits you want to earn in the month of October
b)How many projects can you work upon
c)Number of hours that you can devote to your projects
d)Name of the projects that you want to be a part of
e)Plan of action with your mentors

You are required to submit these answers by Today 6 PM. Let me know in case you face any challenges in Submitting the responses.

This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Let us start Today’s morning with this motivational quote:
He who asks a question is a fool for five minutes; he who does not ask a question remains a fool forever.
13/10/22, 18:27 - Unknown: I noticed that you have not submitted the Saturday’s Activity yet. The deadline for that was Tuesday 6 PM but I gave you a leeway. Due to the delay, You also missed out on the Wednesday lesson that I was not able to share with you due to the pending last two submissions.

Today, At all costs, I would need the submission for the Last week's Saturday Activity.
I am sharing it below.

After that, I am sharing this week's Wednesday Lesson which you have to submit on Friday by 6 PM.

We can not allow ourselves to at a such mediocre pace.
If somehow, You have not received it, I am sharing it below again. From next time, Please be accountable and reach out to me in case you are unable to receive the tasks because these are meant for your benefit.
13/10/22, 18:27 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.
13/10/22, 18:28 - Unknown: Now, I am sharing Last week’s Saturday Activity below:

25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

27/07/22, 04:59 - Runyararo EWYL21E0565: Okay Sir
27/07/22, 19:45 - Unknown: Hello Runyararo, I hope you have finished your work on the activity.
28/07/22, 20:47 - Runyararo EWYL21E0565: Greetings Sir. I'm sorry my mobile has been acting up for the past few days.  I've lost the weekend activity.  I'm sorry
31/07/22, 21:33 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. \r
﻿\r
So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!\r
﻿\r
Happy Weekend!\r

01/08/22, 16:57 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

15/08/22, 21:34 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well.

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off
