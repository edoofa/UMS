05/12/23, 16:09 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: Ok
05/12/23, 16:09 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: Well noted
05/12/23, 16:10 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing well, thank you.
05/12/23, 16:11 - Saloni Rastogi: Out of these two options, can you please choose one?
05/12/23, 16:12 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: sorry l was thinking
05/12/23, 16:13 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: I think the option 2 is ok by me since l had started  with it order
05/12/23, 16:14 - Saloni Rastogi: That is awesome, can you how will you start working on the school project?
05/12/23, 16:15 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: In January we can start with the option 1
05/12/23, 16:15 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: You remember that l open a group and l send some application letter to you
05/12/23, 16:17 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: And some of the people order letter
05/12/23, 16:18 - Saloni Rastogi: That is alright, but since you stated about the school project, may I know how will you be working on it now?
05/12/23, 16:20 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: Ok l am going to communicate with school principals about edoof
05/12/23, 16:22 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: And l am going to get  people for different countries though my father
05/12/23, 16:35 - Saloni Rastogi: That is awesome!
05/12/23, 16:35 - Saloni Rastogi: There are two ways to work on the African School Reform project:
05/12/23, 16:35 - Saloni Rastogi: A. *Connecting with school virtually*-

~ In this you would have to find the contacts of the schools through your peers, friends, neighbours, cousins, school teachers, school heads.

~ Then introduce yourself to them professionally and state the purpose of connecting with them along with their available time.

~ Then share information about Edoofa that I will be providing you in order to help them understand the Program deeply and with more clarity.

~ Then share the school form with them, and if they are interested to connect with us, then are aim should be to get the form filled.
05/12/23, 16:35 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: Ok
05/12/23, 16:35 - Saloni Rastogi: B. *Visiting schools physically*


~ Now by this, as it clearly says, that you have to visit schools nearby and inform them about Edoofa.

~ Visiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
~ With this, you will surely gain a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, overcome the fear of presenting yourself and your family Edoofa,spontaneously in front of anyone at any point.
05/12/23, 16:39 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: Well noted l think l will try the start own and see how it works
05/12/23, 16:40 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: If that is done l will choose the second one
05/12/23, 16:41 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: To see which own works better
05/12/23, 16:45 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: I mean l will try the first option
05/12/23, 16:53 - Saloni Rastogi: That is great Revelation, so, I am sure by today you will be able to find at least 2-3 school heads contacts?
05/12/23, 16:59 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: Yes l will do my best
05/12/23, 17:00 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: Have great day
05/12/23, 17:02 - Saloni Rastogi: We're wrapping up today's session, and I'm thrilled about what's coming up tomorrow. I can't wait for our daily ritual to continue, and I'm confident you'll be right on track to dive into Wednesday's lesson with enthusiasm.
Get ready for another dose of knowledge and excitement! See you tomorrow!
06/12/23, 16:18 - Saloni Rastogi: *_Happy Wednesday, Proud Edoofian!_*

12/12/23, 15:56 - Saloni Rastogi: Revelation before that, I would like to inform you that you did not receive the Saturday activity since you did not follow the daily ritual on 9th December. I would now share the activity with you and I would encourage that you work on it after the session and share the response with me by today.
12/12/23, 15:56 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!
12/12/23, 15:56 - Saloni Rastogi: For now, we can discuss the projects. Is that fine with you?

12/12/23, 16:05 - Saloni Rastogi: So Revelation, you said that the schools would be opening in January. This simply eliminates the method of visiting the schools physically, but I am sure we can try reaching out to more schools virtually that is through WhatsApp.
12/12/23, 16:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Revelation, if schools seemed to be closed then why not focus on community building project?

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work ‚Äì a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.üåü

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
27/09/23, 14:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù
27/09/23, 14:38 - Saloni Rastogi: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter

3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
27/09/23, 14:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from 12:00-01:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.

03/10/23, 17:06 - Saloni Rastogi: I know you are occupied in your classes most of the time. Therefore, I would like to give you two options:

First, if you would like to keep your Program On Hold till the time you have your exams
Second, you can share all your updates on a day prior to your scheduled sessions at your available time along with projects. This will not halt your progress in the EWYL Program and I will continue to share the feedback of the same in the scheduled session only.

04/10/23, 16:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofians,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning

How are you?

Before we start our session, I would like to correct you here that the spelling of edoofian is 'edoofian'. I hope you will correct it from next time onwards while following the daily ritual.
06/10/23, 16:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Today, we're discussing the importance of belonging to a community in our journey towards success.
Belonging to a community, whether it's a family, a social group, or a professional network, can be incredibly motivating. It gives us a sense of purpose and a desire to contribute and be recognized. Communities provide a support system that helps us overcome obstacles, and they are rich sources of knowledge and expertise.

As we explore the significance of belongingness, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic and any project updates you might have. Please share your views and updates here.
06/10/23, 16:38 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: Sense ot is to know or having knowledge about what is around you and how you can use it for your benefit . define what is around and how it can impact our todays lifes

06/10/23, 16:42 - Revelation EWYL23E0533: On the first line
06/10/23, 16:43 - Saloni Rastogi: "Sense of belonging is the awareness and knowledge of one's surroundings and how they can be harnessed for personal advantage. Our immediate environment, including physical, social, and cultural aspects, significantly impacts our daily lives, influencing our decisions, relationships, and opportunities."
Mind-blowing fact: "Belonging to a community has been proven to increase overall life satisfaction and even extend lifespan. Studies show that individuals who actively engage in supportive communities tend to experience better mental and physical health outcomes, emphasizing the profound impact of social connections on our well-being." üåüü§ù
