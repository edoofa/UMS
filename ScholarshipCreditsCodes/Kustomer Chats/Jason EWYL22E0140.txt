04/10/22, 21:27 - Jason EWYL22E0140: Yes sir it is

I hope that you are doing well

I am sure that you must have had a blessed weekend
In case, You were not able to receive the Wednesday Lesson, I am sharing it below for your ease.
07/10/22, 01:14 - Jason EWYL22E0140: Thank youu
07/10/22, 17:59 - Unknown: Greetings, Proud Edoofian 
I hope that you are doing well
07/10/22, 17:59 - Unknown: May I know by when will you be able to submit the Wednesday Lesson that I have shared above?

Please note that Today 3 PM is the deadline for submission.
After that no submissions will be considered and you would have to write an email to the Head of Department quoting the reason for not submitting the lesson
07/10/22, 19:25 - Jason EWYL22E0140: Sir i am experiencing network difficulties
07/10/22, 19:26 - Jason EWYL22E0140: I cannot seem to send the audio
07/10/22, 21:02 - Unknown: Which audio do you want to share, Jason?
13/10/22, 19:40 - Jason EWYL22E0140: IAM a proud EDOOFIAN
13/10/22, 19:42 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
13/10/22, 22:15 - Unknown: Greetings, Proud Edoofian
I hope that you are in good health and spirits

Let us start Today’s morning with this motivational quote:
He who asks a question is a fool for five minutes; he who does not ask a question remains a fool forever.
13/10/22, 22:15 - Unknown: I noticed that you have not submitted the Saturday’s Activity yet. The deadline for that was Tuesday 6 PM but I gave you a leeway. Due to the delay, You also missed out on the Wednesday lesson that I was not able to share with you due to the pending last two submissions.

Today, At all costs, I would need the submission for the Last week's Saturday Activity.
I am sharing it below.

After that, I am sharing this week's Wednesday Lesson which you have to submit on Friday by 6 PM.

We can not allow ourselves to at a such mediocre pace.
If somehow, You have not received it, I am sharing it below again.
13/10/22, 22:16 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.
13/10/22, 22:16 - Unknown: Now, I am sharing Last week’s Saturday Activity below:

Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!
13/10/22, 23:36 - Jason EWYL22E0140: Okay sir let me get right to it

01/11/22, 22:27 - Unknown: \"A goal is not always meant to be reached; it often serves simply as something to aim at.\" –Bruce Lee

The above quote more or less means True success is all about working towards meaningful goals and dreams.

And this was somewhat the idea we learned and discussed in our Wednesday Lesson as well, the mindset of a winner and the habits that lead to it.

In this week's activity, you shall be putting this to use in your own working zone, by creating a list of targets\/goals, that you shall aim to achieve in a week. For a suggestion, you can start by setting up a number of Schools you would try connecting to in a week, the number of companies you shall reach out to, or the number of fellow community mates you would tell about edoofa.

This list, you shall share this with your mentors, and they would also keep a note of it. At the end of the week, you shall discuss with them, whether or not were you able to achieve the target, and what kind of mindset change did this activity lead you to.

Please make the submission using this form:
Project Chosen:
Target:

I hope you all will try to push your limits and aim at the sky always. This activity should be a part of habit building, which would make you a better and more organized individual and professional.

How are you?

In the past few days, You must have observed that I was not very active in our sessions.

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:34 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well.

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
