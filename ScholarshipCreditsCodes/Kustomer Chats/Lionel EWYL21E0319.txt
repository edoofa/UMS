09/05/23, 17:52 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: Okay
09/05/23, 18:03 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: When l read the ewyl document  


I learnt about  the 4 projects  

1 *Coorporate  alliance*

Were by us as edoofians we are to look for organizations  or companies  that we might work with. 

So the first  thing  is to identify  decision makers and get in contact  with them and  discuss  with them about  edoofa  scholarship  program  and convince  them to be part of the program  or make alliance  .


And after having  discussed as an edoofian am expected  to arrange a call with the  decisions  makers with the edoofa board .

And hopefully  after the call they will  be signing  of contracts. 


2 *Community  building*


This is when we have to spread news to our fellow  African   ,news about  edoofa and telling vthem of the benefits of studying  in india.

After that we venture  into filling  of applications  forms  by the students  applicants  whom have agreed and convinced to be part of edoofa 


3 *African School education reform mission*


This is the project  wereby  we visit different  African  schools  qnd tell them about  edoofa and signing  of contracts  with schools  .

.4 *Incetives and payouts*
09/05/23, 19:37 - Aditi Kapoor: That's great Lionel!
May I know which project excited you?
09/05/23, 19:58 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: Me l love the corporate alliance  but it seems hard
10/05/23, 18:16 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Lionel!
How are you?
Please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'.
10/05/23, 18:16 - Aditi Kapoor: No, it is not at all hard. Let me ease it up for you.
10/05/23, 18:17 - Aditi Kapoor: I am sharing audio with you that talks about the _IMPORTANCE OF CORPORATE ALLIANCE_
10/05/23, 18:18 - Aditi Kapoor: Once you listen to it, share your understanding with me.
10/05/23, 21:07 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: Okay
10/05/23, 21:07 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: Okay
13/05/23, 07:34 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: Morning  ,am a proud edoofian
13/05/23, 07:34 - Aditi Kapoor: `- That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!`

`- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.``- How do you intend to broaden this student community? 

In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.
16/05/23, 21:07 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: Hi how are y
22/05/23, 08:42 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: Morning

How's your day going?
12/07/22, 20:41 - Aditi Kapoor: Lionel I will be sharing the Isaac target very soon on the ISAAC application very soon, please stay updated on that.
12/07/22, 20:42 - Aditi Kapoor: Along with this Lionel, I want to know about your updates on our three ongoing projects of the EWYL journey.
12/07/22, 20:44 - Aditi Kapoor: How many referrals have you brought till now under the community building project? I have written in my records but I just wanted to have a confirmation from you so that we are on the same page.
12/07/22, 21:37 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: Am okay
12/07/22, 21:37 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: Ok
12/07/22, 21:37 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: Ok
12/07/22, 21:39 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: Still  working  on it
12/07/22, 23:04 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: 4
14/07/22, 02:59 - Aditi Kapoor: That matched my record Lionel but don't you think the number is very low? I have students who send 3-5 referrals each day.
Are you facing any problems? If yes, then please let me know.
14/07/22, 23:58 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: I am a proud edoofian
14/07/22, 23:59 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

15/07/22, 08:54 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: Having read the Wednesday wisdom  l have been inspired Patrice because  he is a hardworking  man with great goals. 
Patrice has thought  of his childhood background  and took advantage  of it and made future  for himself. The fact that he grew in a community  of miners and seeing workers spending  money ,he thought  if the work is spending this much what about the owner and he took it as  an advantage to start  his mine studies .On this this part he inspired  me  ,he just took the small which was always  in front of his eyes and thought of a better way of making great amounts 

What l also liked was that he did knew how to plough  back profits into  the business  in order for him to generate even more income   making him a disciplined man when it comes to money 

I  really enjoyed how others are making  money ,and saw tht what is needed is commitment, hardworking and love for the vision

Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a WAY. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. We can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard.

And this was what our *WEDNESDAY Wisdom* was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
3. Your pending response to the weekend activity
21/07/22, 21:38 - Aditi Kapoor: Also I want to applaud you for the successful completion of the Isaac project, I am so glad that completed your target on time. Makes me so proud of you right now.

22/07/22, 00:11 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: Saturday  activity 


The growing  industry  in Zimbabwe  is the mining industry  qnd and it has been performing a pivotal role in the  increasing  of economic  growth  . Previously  ghe Zimbabwean nation was leading  in the agricultural sector  bit the efforts have interchanged to the mining  industry 

And the mining  industry it is increasing  the regional  market  share and increasing economic  growth whiccb has resulted  in a strong  increase  of worker employment  reducing the unemployment  rate in the economy. 
The strength which have  seen as citizens  in this growth of the mining  industry  is that it is also increasing  macroeconomic stability 

And there is a great opportunities for the mining  industry  which is   expansion in the mineral production to meet demand through foreign and domestic  investment 

However  they are some limiting  factors or threats to its growth. The fact our mining  industry  has q pot of china equipment or l mean help ,this means the growth of china  falls  down  they will a fall on the mineral prices resulting  in a decrease  on the country's  Gdp
.Recession  is also a threat  because  if the  global recession  rise it will cause qnd increase in intrest rates  lowering  capital markets actually   for financing  .

Lastly  the weakness in the mining  industry, in Zimbabwe  the is a shortage of coal reserves  causing  the country  to benefit  less to end products of coal manufacturing   .They are also risk of accidents  and incidents  peculiar  to heavy  industry  so these reasons  might act as limitation  to the growing industry  in Zimbabwe  which us mining 

Thank you  
Happy learning
22/07/22, 01:26 - Aditi Kapoor: I read your response to your weekend activity and it made me so inquisitive to know about the mining industry I got to know that predominant minerals mined by the industry include platinum, chrome, gold, coal, and diamonds. The country boasts the second-largest platinum deposit and high-grade chromium ores in the world, with approximately 2.8 billion tons of platinum group metals and 10 billion tons of chromium ore.
Your response is so elaborative and impressive and it provided me with so much knowledge.
22/07/22, 01:26 - Aditi Kapoor: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.
22/07/22, 01:26 - Aditi Kapoor: Now we are left with 
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
22/07/22, 01:36 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: Yes l am ready
22/07/22, 01:39 - Aditi Kapoor: Please share your understanding to the Wednesday lesson first.
22/07/22, 01:49 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: On the Wednesday activity  l learned a lot but the main point  which l took not of was the word *blame* .
L learnt  that the poor they have a tendency  of blaming others or the economy  to  their failure in life whilst the rich dont blame but often learn from their  mistake and makes some adjustment were ots needed  

I also took note of these words  *dissatisfaction and failure in life are caused by the propensity to place blame somewhere*
 So l saw it as a lack of knowledge  to always for something or someone to blame  instead you have to accept responsibility, learn from your mistakes and do something  about  it.

And if you behave in life like the sailor who was laying down and later blame the sea .

So the only therapy  which l learned to conquer blame are 
1 stay positive 
2 stay focused 
3 remain determined 
For only losers place balme on other 


# team saloni
22/07/22, 04:46 - Aditi Kapoor: I read your response Lionel and I would love to share an article on successful people with you:`
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.`
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
22/07/22, 04:48 - Aditi Kapoor: In the end you wrote #teamSaloni, it got tears in my eyes. Thank you for believing in me.
I am so proud to be your mentor.
22/07/22, 04:52 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: Thank you ?
22/07/22, 04:52 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: And l am also proud  to be your  student
23/07/22, 03:56 - Aditi Kapoor: Thank you so much Lionel.
23/07/22, 04:13 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: Okay
25/07/22, 03:17 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
25/07/22, 19:42 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: Successful people  has a mindset that is way better than unsuccessful people  because they never take failure  as some one fault  but rather take it as lifetime  lessons. They often grow in becoming more successful people  because they often adopt the theory  of benchmarking  ,copying what is best in someone or company. So as of me  inorder to develop  the same character  l will erase a mentality  of failure  in me ,that if something  has failed it has no second  chance but rather successful people they take failure  as challenge  ,so me l will develop  tht mindset  from the first day of my tertiary  education that for every failure  l should  not give up but rather take the challenge  serious and correct  my mistakes  cause in every failure  they are some loopholes .

Successful people  often compliment  others qnd also acknowledge those who are better  than them ,and they do compete with them but not to create  grudges  ,so as of me l will try to adapt that mindest by accepting that  they are always people intelligent ,brighter ,richer or strong than me .The moment  l acknowledge them for being  good than me it usually  create chances of joint venture  or of working  together and l will have the chance to better  like them oe even more

To be successful l must develop  the mindest of strong  determination, focus and hardwork .




Successful people  they don't  blame others of their mistake  qnd that is a powerful growth mindset  ✨ because  the moment  you dont put blame on others it the moment  you accept some things are hard and they do need extra strength. So as of me to develop the mindset  l must neglect  the mentality of blaming  others instead  of copying with the failure and gather tactics to conquer  what has conquered  me

26/07/22, 16:41 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

Yesterday I had an amazing day. I went to the airport to receive all my proud Edoofians and I had tears in my eyes seeing their happiness and enthusiasm. I want you to look at it and share your thoughts with me. :fireworks:
26/07/22, 16:59 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: I have noticed happy faces and great smiles ,they is also a good relationship between the mentors  and the students  ,this can be seen in the standing order wereby  the mentors are mixed up with the student. 
And lastly  they faces has great enthusiasm and they reflect a good welcome done to them by the edoofa mentors
26/07/22, 19:02 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, indeed Lionel. I was so emotional when I welcomed them and seeing their happy faces made my moment.
26/07/22, 19:08 - Aditi Kapoor: Along with this, I read your understanding of the activity Lionel and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it’s not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you’re looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don’t do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.

28/07/22, 22:53 - Aditi Kapoor: Time management is defined as using your time productively and efficiently—but what about when you are working as productively as possible, and you still can’t get everything done? It may be better to think about time management as a combination of working productively and prioritizing your time.

Our *Wednesday Wisdom* was all about Time Management and understanding the priority matrix to organize our tasks. 
I am really excited to hear your understanding and working on the same.
Please share it with me here.
In today's session we will talk about:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. progress on community building projects.
29/07/22, 23:26 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: I am a proud edoofian
29/07/22, 23:27 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

30/07/22, 03:23 - Lionel EWYL21E0319: On the Wednesday wisdom l have learnt that tme management  usvthe ability to use tme efficiently and it alsobthe ability to perform every task you not being stressed 

And l have learnt that inorder ti successfully manage time we have to apply the principle of *prioritization* ,meaning yiu are to start with what is needed most and how important it is .

And l have grasped the difference between  urgent and important. Urgency us the work that need mediate attention wereas important it is the task matter.

I have learnt a lot on the priority matrix  ,it s indeed a great way to go wereby you have to fill the work to be done in their importance and their urgeny
31/07/22, 21:34 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. \r
﻿\r
So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!\r
﻿\r
Happy Weekend!\r
