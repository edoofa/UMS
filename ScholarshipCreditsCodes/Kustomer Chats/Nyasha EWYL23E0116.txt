19/06/23, 15:42 - Nyasha EWYL23E0116: Yes mam
19/06/23, 15:48 - Jasmine Kaur: Before we embark on this new week, I would like to discuss one of my expectations regarding your participation in the EWYL Line. I kindly request that you join the EWYL Line every day, as the first task in the morning, and enthusiastically chant "I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN" with the group. This practice serves to instill a sense of pride, motivation, and unity among Edoofians.
Furthermore, I encourage you to aim for perfect attendance this week, attending the EWYL Line 7 out of 7 days.

Now, let us begin our session. I trust that you have completed your Saturday Activity, and I am eager to review it. Please share your Saturday Activity with me, as we delve into a productive discussion.
19/06/23, 15:49 - Nyasha EWYL23E0116: Noted mam

19/06/23, 15:52 - Nyasha EWYL23E0116: On Saturday I visited one of the schools nearby , I talked with one of the staff regarding the Edoofa scholarship program and I was told to come and meet the principal next weekend since he is attending a workshop,  

I was also given the opportunity to meet the upper six students so as to tell them on how I passed my exams and got a scholarship.
19/06/23, 15:58 - Jasmine Kaur: That is great Nyasha, we will discuss this for sure. May I know that have you completed your activity?
19/06/23, 17:57 - Nyasha EWYL23E0116: Yes mam
19/06/23, 18:28 - Jasmine Kaur: It is disheartening to note that, following the weekend break, you have been unable to attend the session with the level of engagement required. It is essential that we emphasize the significance of time and value each other's commitment.
Regrettably, due to your inactive behavior during today's session, we were unable to fully utilize the allocated 60 minutes. This lack of active participation will hinder your progress and will prevent you from getting the maximum benefits of the EWYL program.

Moving forward, I recommend that you fully comprehend the importance of punctuality, and active participation, and value my time as your mentor. Now it’s time to end our session here and we will meet on Thursday at 12:00 pm.

Have a nice day ahead!

20/06/23, 12:14 - Nyasha EWYL23E0116: Good morning mam
20/06/23, 13:27 - Nyasha EWYL23E0116: Qsn 1 making 1 percent improvement to what already works rather than breaking the whole system and starting over 
2  one of the example is by considering the nature, some  experts believe the feathers of birds evolved from reptilian scales. Through the
forces of evolution, scales gradually became small feathers, which were used for warmth
and insulation at first. Eventually, these small fluffs developed into larger feather capable to flight.There wasn't a magical moment when the animal kingdom said, “Let's start from
scratch and create an animal that can fly.” The development of flying birds was a
gradual process of iterating and expanding upon ideas that already worked. The
process of human flight followed a similar path.
20/06/23, 16:12 - Nyasha EWYL23E0116: Good afternoon mam
21/06/23, 13:18 - Nyasha EWYL23E0116: I'M A PROUD EDOOFIAN 🔥🔥
