It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

29/10/22, 00:27 - Unknown: Hi *Viola*,
It has been a while since we have connected now,
I hope that you love the taste of *Indian Education* The modern curriculum comprises a holistic learning approach and doesn't just limit itself to core subjects. Universities now tend to focus more on acquiring skills in technology, communication, critical thinking and problem solving. 

There is also enough emphasis on cultural studies and society. These aspects help you understand the problems that many communities face and they get an idea as to how they can use their knowledge for the betterment of the same.
There is also an equal emphasis on extra-curricular activities to help build your personality and improve your innate strengths.
29/10/22, 16:16 - Viola EWYL21E0802: Good morning ma'am
29/10/22, 16:16 - Viola EWYL21E0802: I am a proud Edoofian
29/10/22, 16:17 - Viola EWYL21E0802: I agree. The Indian education system is quite interesting and challenging at the same time
