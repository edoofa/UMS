02/10/22, 23:01 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0554: Thank you  mentor, I am still downloading them and as soon as I do i view them I will send what i think
02/10/22, 23:04 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0554: Okay mentor, so in a nutshell the pictures are reminding me that I supposed to keep on working hard and preserve. This is because no good life comes from taking shortcuts and there is not gain without pain. So if I want to make it in life i should brace myself and face all the punches life has to throw at me until i reach my goals rather than wanting all to be well without working for it.

07/10/22, 00:29 - Unknown: So we know, a lot of you have been keeping busy these days with your exams and academic curriculum. And while we wish you all the luck for it, we don't want you to miss out on your learning and skill building. In today's lesson, we will discuss how to build our capacity to multitask, manage our time and prioritize our daily tasks in order to have it all. 

Let's dig right in, and understand how if you follow these steps, you will be able to manage your exams, assignments, extra curriculars, and your EWYL projects all at one go. After going through this, you must discuss the plan of action to execute these steps with your mentors.

Happy Learning!

08/10/22, 20:34 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!
