02/02/23, 22:22 - Blessing EWYL22E0849: I am a proud edoofian
03/02/23, 17:25 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr

10/02/23, 23:10 - Jasmine Kaur: First of all, I would like to congratulate you on being selected for the Social Media Project. I have been observing your active participation and interest in the EWYL program so I have chosen you to take part in a special project where you will learn how social media can benefit a company or an organization from the amount of customer engagement on their platforms, as well as positive reviews. 

From this project, you will learn how to be familiar with social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube, understand how Edoofa’s social media is built, network and build a connection with other students around the world, and much more!

The scholarship credits that you can earn from this project are a total of $20, which you will get when you complete each and every task every day successfully. In the worst-case scenario, if you are not able to complete the task given to you before the deadline due to a genuine reason, you will only be given the credits for the tasks you have accomplished, so make sure not to miss out on any task to attain the maximum credits from this project.

Duration of project: 1 month

13/02/23, 21:14 - Blessing EWYL22E0849: It was the first term of the year 2019 when l was in form 3 at Rushinga high school, with my mentor we were planning to start a new club of National Aids Council quiz.Since l was the only quiz member of the previous team left at school l was then selected as the team leader.

With the mentor we discussed on how to start a new club and what we need for us to succeed on having a well functioning club.l was assigned to address the issue at the assembly point where all the students will be available,so that those who are interested with the club will meet up with them.On the first day of the session the classroom was half with students who were interested, to my surprise on the next session was left with one student,l had to convince others.At that time that's when l thought of downloading national aid council quiz competitions clips at all level and have to post iton the school platform also with the benefits of the club (presents) since they thought it was only done at school level they were convinced by the video clips hence joined again and we made a great team that participated at Provincial level for the first time in the history of the school.

Demonstrating the inner sense of captaincy in this situation l built confidence when l was left with one student knowing that l can do it.Also was able to make quick decision of downloading the video clips of NAC quiz competitions and them posted it on the school platform.

After doing this l have succeeded in having a school quiz club that make my mentor proud of me since l managed to conquer some difficulties l have faced along the way,and managed to make a great club in the history of the school.

16/03/23, 22:06 - Blessing EWYL22E0849: Wednesday wisdom
Seek wealth,not money or status.

Many people strive for money and status thinking that they will give them happiness and fulfillment however in reality they bring stress and depression.Wealth is defined as having assets that is earned while you sleep l, meaning the value of the money will continue to increase even when you are not working like when you invest in real estate.Tye key to build wealth is to focus on creating assets that generate passive income,like investing in things like Rental properties without requiring your active involvement that will help create a steady stream of income of income that can support you and family for years to come.
Money is just a tool to transfer wealth and time thus it should not be the sole focus of the financial goals .True happiness comes from within not from external velidation hence not measured by true success or happiness.
16/03/23, 22:10 - Jasmine Kaur: Thank you for sharing your Wednesday Wisdom, Blessing. Your message about seeking wealth instead of solely chasing money or status is a valuable reminder. 

It's important to focus on creating assets that generate passive income and provide long-term financial security. True happiness comes from within and should not be tied solely to external validation or financial success. 
Thanks again for sharing your insights!

06/03/23, 19:57 - Aditi Kapoor: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”
