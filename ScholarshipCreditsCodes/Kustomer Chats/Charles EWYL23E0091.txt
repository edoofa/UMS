19/12/23, 16:08 - Charles EWYL23E0091: Yes mam I am clere
19/12/23, 16:13 - Jasmine Kaur: As we approach the end of the year with just 12 days remaining
I want you to give your utmost dedication and focus on accomplishing your goals.

This is an opportune moment, especially considering that many individuals are free during the holidays and available for conversations.

So are you prepared to invest your full efforts in making the most of the last 12 days of 2023?
19/12/23, 16:14 - Charles EWYL23E0091: Yes I am prepared
19/12/23, 16:14 - Jasmine Kaur: Absolutely! To make our end-of-year push more effective, let's set a tangible goal to keep track of your progress. I'm suggesting a target of submitting 5 applications for Community Building and one school application before December 31, 2023.

I believe in your capabilities and encourage you to give it your all to achieve this milestone.

Can you commit to putting in your best effort to meet this goal?
19/12/23, 16:15 - Charles EWYL23E0091: Yes I can try my best
19/12/23, 16:18 - Jasmine Kaur: Great, So please go ahead and share with me on how are you going to achieve this target?
19/12/23, 16:20 - Charles EWYL23E0091: First I am going widely on web  to know mor about schools and get contacts of different schools
19/12/23, 16:21 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, Given that schools are currently closed, your approach would involve reaching out to headmasters via WhatsApp. Provide a concise introduction about the Edoofa Scholarship Program, and if they express interest, inform them that once they share the offline filled form with you, you can facilitate a connection with the program director. This connection will allow them to delve deeper into the program's details and explore the benefits it offers to schools.
19/12/23, 16:22 - Charles EWYL23E0091: That was my second idea when I get in contact with their number then I reach out them through WhatsApp
19/12/23, 16:22 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, To meet your goal of submitting 5 community-building applications, your task is to connect with at least 10 students and give them a quick overview of the Edoofa Scholarship program. Encourage them to fill out the application form to apply for the scholarship. Upon completion, they'll gain access to free counseling sessions where experienced counselors will provide one-on-one career guidance.
19/12/23, 16:24 - Charles EWYL23E0091: Understood maam so we're can I send the application
19/12/23, 16:25 - Jasmine Kaur: You have to send the applications to me, Charles.
19/12/23, 16:25 - Charles EWYL23E0091: I'm this chat
