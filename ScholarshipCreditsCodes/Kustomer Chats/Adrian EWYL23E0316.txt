09/08/23, 15:46 - Adrian EWYL23E0316: Thank you Ms Ananya
09/08/23, 15:59 - Adrian EWYL23E0316: When talent beats hard work. Just with the discovery of talent you will be taken far and far that comes with a price. I liked the lesson. Thank you Ms Ananya.
18/08/23, 13:08 - Adrian EWYL23E0316: Good morning how are you Ms Ananya?
18/08/23, 13:20 - Ananya: I am good, how about you?
18/08/23, 13:34 - Adrian EWYL23E0316: I am good thank you for asking.
18/08/23, 13:37 - Ananya: So, Adrain would you like to tell me about your favorite project?
18/08/23, 13:46 - Adrian EWYL23E0316: I liked the Search Engine Optimization.
18/08/23, 13:48 - Ananya: That's great! However I am asking from the last three EWYL projects..
18/08/23, 13:58 - Adrian EWYL23E0316: I think it is the one about reaching out to companies through LinkedIn and other social media platforms.
18/08/23, 14:04 - Adrian EWYL23E0316: So far I got to interact with one professional from Akello.
18/08/23, 14:07 - Ananya: That's great! However, you know we have put this project on hold. Whenever we will resume this project, I will let you know.
18/08/23, 14:11 - Adrian EWYL23E0316: Ohhh okay I didn't know.
18/08/23, 14:12 - Adrian EWYL23E0316: So I am supposed to continue with the one for looking for interested students and then create a group.
18/08/23, 14:13 - Ananya: Yes, and the school reform project!
18/08/23, 14:15 - Ananya: -Let me share with you how our star performer for the last week-Loice did complete her targets.
She shared three schools and you know she got to know about them through Google.
She simply searched on Google like 'School nearby'/'School in Harare'/'School in Manicaland' and so on. She was able to yield results.
So even without physically visiting them, she got to know about them through Google, got their contact details, and after that got in touch with them Via WhatsApp.
3)  please reach out to all your friends, peers, cousins, neighbors, school mates, to get their School Head's contact details.
4)  visit schools in your province, physical visits can add another touch to the conversations and make them a lot more impactful.
18/08/23, 14:16 - Adrian EWYL23E0316: Very well noted
18/08/23, 14:18 - Ananya: This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success
‚ñ™Ô∏èVisiting schools physically can put a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, leadership quality, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear to present himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.
18/08/23, 14:18 - Ananya: .
18/08/23, 14:20 - Adrian EWYL23E0316: It is great actually feeling motivated already
18/08/23, 14:23 - Adrian EWYL23E0316: But still on the project I was struggling with the opening statements for conversations.
18/08/23, 14:24 - Ananya: That sounds good. I'd like you to consider adopting the same approach. You could also take printouts of the application form and distribute them among the students. This strategy has been successfully implemented with one of my students, and we have observed a positive response.
18/08/23, 14:27 - Adrian EWYL23E0316: Ohhh okay very well noted
18/08/23, 14:29 - Ananya: Now let us conclude our session here, we shall now connect in our next session and learn some tricks to increase your community.

25/08/23, 15:55 - Adrian EWYL23E0316: The PDF is talking about creating a CV also known as Curriculum Vitae.

It is used for job applications but in this scenario it is used for applying at a University or college.
25/08/23, 15:58 - Ananya: Great! So are you interested in creating a cv for yourself?

She clearly highlighted that when I include information that differentiates me from other applicants I need to clearly highlight my proficiency in each and every skill. If there are any skills I then need to give reference to the teachers that can agree to the extracurricular activities I would partaken in.
25/08/23, 16:17 - Ananya: Amazing, so by when would you be able to create a cv then?
