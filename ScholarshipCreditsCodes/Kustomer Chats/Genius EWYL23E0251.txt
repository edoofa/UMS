14/07/23, 16:30 - Ananya: Now, -Let me share with you how our star performer for the last week-Loice did complete her targets.
She shared three schools and you know she got to know about them through Google.
She simply searched on Google like 'School nearby'/'School in Harare'/'School in Manicaland' and so on. She was able to yield results.
So even without physically visiting them, she got to know about them through Google, got their contact details, and after that got in touch with them Via WhatsApp.
3)  please reach out to all your friends, peers, cousins, neighbors, school mates, to get their School Head's contact details.
4)  visit schools in your province, physical visits can add another touch to the conversations and make them a lot more impactful.
14/07/23, 16:33 - Genius EWYL23E0251: Noted
14/07/23, 16:43 - Ananya: You know you can also print your student application form and distribute it among the students of the school. This is something one of our students did and was really fruitful.
14/07/23, 17:07 - Ananya: I also want you to follow his ideas and earn more and more credits. I really want that I will be giving your examples to my other student. So work hard.
Now let us connect in our next session. Happy weekend and all the best!
14/07/23, 17:10 - Genius EWYL23E0251: Thank you Ms Ananya for the heads up.Happy weekend to you too.
