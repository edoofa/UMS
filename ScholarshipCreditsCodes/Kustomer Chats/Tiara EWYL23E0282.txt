Before we begin, I would like you to explain our *Program Structure* Please go ahead.
04/10/23, 16:14 - Tiara EWYL23E0282: The EWYL journey enables one to have technical and practical skills  whilst one will be at school one will get experience on how to deal with other skills .most importantly a student gains scholarship credits from  this project.this enables a student to meet hand in hand with different companies or institutions whereby this will enable one to be easily employed after completing the studies as the student will have experience .And from the community building project benefits other students to be enlightened about the edoofa program and be part of it
04/10/23, 16:56 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, you are absolutely right. I would like to add on few points

1. We will be meeting twice a week on Monday and Thursday for our sessions.

09/10/23, 13:53 - Tiara EWYL23E0282: Doing very well, bt i Tiara's father on her behalf. I don't know if we can proceed?
09/10/23, 14:01 - Jasmine Kaur: I truly appreciate your dedication to attending the sessions on behalf of Tiara. Could you kindly share the reasons for her unavailability?

While I understand she has school commitments, if she finds it challenging to balance both, there is an alternative option. Tiara can put her sessions on hold for a while. Would you like to know more about how this option works and the process for putting sessions on hold temporarily?
09/10/23, 14:40 - Tiara EWYL23E0282: It's good know, bt for now i don't have a no guaranteed answer until i confirm from her personal. And will give you the update.
