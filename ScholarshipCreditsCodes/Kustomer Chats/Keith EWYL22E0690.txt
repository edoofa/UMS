01/11/22, 23:30 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Greetings, Mr. Anadi, I am Rwaendepi Keith Sam-Cadiq and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is *Keith EWYL22E0690*
01/11/22, 23:37 - Unknown: Greetings Keith! Welcome to the EWYL Dedicated Line. We shall be having all our sessions here, I want you to send the Proud Edoofian Text every day, without any fail on this Line.
01/11/22, 23:38 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Okay sir do i have a specific time i should be texting it
01/11/22, 23:39 - Unknown: Not as such, but I would suggest you do it in the Morning.
01/11/22, 23:40 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Okay
02/11/22, 23:24 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We all have come across the quote, \"Quitters Never Win, and Winners Never Quit\", and we also must have experienced this in our lives, directly or indirectly.

If last week's lesson, taught you the mindset of a winner, this week's lesson is going to teach you the true nature of a winner. Someone, who never gives up, or quits on the dream they see and really want to fulfill, no matter what. Moving through scorching heat, drenching rains, and heavy snow, they reach their destination and complete their journey. In this lesson, you will also learn, what happens when an entire community inherits this trait and keeps working on it. How recognition is earned and respect is gained through time, patience, and endless efforts.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.
02/11/22, 23:34 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Very well
02/11/22, 23:45 - Keith EWYL22E0690: This is interesting
02/11/22, 23:45 - Keith EWYL22E0690: I am a proud Edoofian
02/11/22, 23:46 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

03/11/22, 17:16 - Unknown: Greetings My Dear Proud Edoofian! Let's connect at 5:30 pm Indian Time for our session.
03/11/22, 23:11 - Unknown: Greetings Keith! Are you ready for your session?
04/11/22, 01:33 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Good evening i would like to relay my apology, i am not feeling particularly well and I was resting, i even got dismissed from school early
05/11/22, 01:13 - Unknown: Greetings Keith! I hope it is not worrisome, how is your health now?
05/11/22, 01:15 - Keith EWYL22E0690: I am still on a the prescription they gave me but I am feeling a little better
05/11/22, 01:15 - Keith EWYL22E0690: It's just taking me a little longer to adjust to the new environment that's all
05/11/22, 01:16 - Unknown: I understand Keith! The weather keeps changing here, I would suggest you to stay warm, and put on your winter clothes, as it can get chilly at night.
05/11/22, 01:23 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Yes it's exactly what the physician told me yesterday and i will definitely keep warm
05/11/22, 01:25 - Unknown: Great! Please take care, let's connect tomorrow if you feel better to catch up on your missed session.
05/11/22, 01:25 - Keith EWYL22E0690: That sits well with me
05/11/22, 01:26 - Keith EWYL22E0690: What time?
05/11/22, 01:26 - Unknown: 12 pm IST
05/11/22, 17:24 - Unknown: Greetings Keith! How are you feeling now?
05/11/22, 17:42 - Keith EWYL22E0690: I am feeling better sir
05/11/22, 17:46 - Unknown: Great to hear that Keith!
05/11/22, 17:46 - Unknown: are you ready for your session?
05/11/22, 17:47 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Yes
05/11/22, 17:59 - Unknown: So Keith! Did you go through the Wednesday lesson?
05/11/22, 18:01 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Yes i did
05/11/22, 18:45 - Unknown: can you please share your understanding and learning of the same with me?
05/11/22, 18:48 - Keith EWYL22E0690: It's about not having only a mindset of a winner but also how to be a winner, it explains how native Africans who came to India for slave labour rose to power in the Indian govt and brought about change in their community
05/11/22, 18:50 - Unknown: That's some great understanding Keith! Now, what did you learn from this lesson, that you are thinking of applying in your life?
05/11/22, 18:52 - Keith EWYL22E0690: That if you are dedicated about something in life and you do not quit no matter how difficult or how many challenges arise you will certainly make it in that perspective
05/11/22, 19:00 - Unknown: I am really impressed with your clear understanding Keith! I can be sure of the fact that if you keep up this habit of keen observation and crystal clarity, we can go a long way in the program.
05/11/22, 19:04 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Thank you sir
05/11/22, 19:23 - Unknown: Great! So Keith, are you ready to start working on the projects?
05/11/22, 19:29 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Yes i am sir
05/11/22, 19:35 - Unknown: Great! So, I want you to set a target for your own self relating to the projects, which you try to achieve in the week.
05/11/22, 19:45 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Can you explain more
05/11/22, 19:54 - Unknown: Sure, there are 3 projects, which you shall be working on, right? i.e. African Schools Connect, Community Building, Corporate Alliance.

So, I want you to set a target for the numbers you shall be trying to achieve in the coming week, in all three projects.
05/11/22, 19:56 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Can I pick one project at a time
05/11/22, 21:06 - Unknown: You can do that Keith! But I would suggest you work on all the projects as they can be easily managed simultaneously! I don't want you to only put your entire focus on one single project because, if you are working in different fields, and are gaining experience in all of them, it would make it easier for you to be a part of the other outsourced projects, which we take up. There are fellow edoofians, who are working on all kinds of projects and are doing really well for building better opportunities for themselves.
05/11/22, 21:07 - Unknown: Also, I do not want you to focus entirely on the projects. I would suggest you dedicate just 1 hour of undivided attention to your projects daily! So that you also learn a habit of working regularly and actively.
05/11/22, 21:43 - Unknown: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian!

“My job is not to be easy on people. My job is to make them better.”- Steve Jobs

And till now, our founder Mr. Angad has always been a guiding light for everyone at Edoofa. And has made sure we all turn out to be future leaders in our fields, no matter how hard it seems, we should keep moving with single harmony toward our goals and motives. But, leadership can not only be taught, as it is not a literary subject, but a practical life experience that is to be taken up and practiced and bettered with each passing day.

Hence, after the very encouraging Wednesday lesson on how good leadership and patience can change the entire ideology and perception of a community to grow back from the ashes. Today's Activity is going to give you a first-hand experience to fit yourselves in a small part of the leadership shoes. I want you to create a newsletter of your own. Similar to the ones you have enjoyed reading every Sunday from the founder's office.

Your Newsletter should consider the following things:  Quotes that have been motivating you for some time now, or your three favorite quotes which motivate you to be better every day.
and,
2. One story of your idol, that can be any person, who according to you has contributed to making the community and world a better place for people to live. The story should also consist of a part stating the reason why they are your idol.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own capabilities while performing this activity.

The best newsletters of the week shall be shared with all the fellow edoofians next week.

Have a wonderful weekend ahead.
05/11/22, 22:11 - Unknown: The deadline for the submission of this newsletter is 12 pm Zimbabwe Time Monday.

08/11/22, 18:24 - Unknown: Greetings Keith! How are you?
09/11/22, 19:14 - Unknown: Greetings My Dear Proud Edoofian! Let's connect today at 3:30 pm Indian Time to catch up on our missed session!
09/11/22, 23:24 - Unknown: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian,

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.
10/11/22, 00:17 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Good evening im now available want to continue
10/11/22, 00:22 - Unknown: Hello Keith! Firstly, I want to tell you that your newsletter was quite impressive, although I want you to make one change to it. I want you to share the story of your idol in life and why they are your idol. Currently, I see you sharing your own story.
10/11/22, 00:25 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Ooh i apologise i must have forgotten about that part, by when do you want the adjusted one?
10/11/22, 00:27 - Unknown: By Tonight, so that I can send it to the board for evaluation.
10/11/22, 00:31 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Okay can i take some time to edit the newsletter
10/11/22, 00:33 - Unknown: Sure! You can send it before 8 in the morning tomorrow.
10/11/22, 00:35 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Okay sir
10/11/22, 17:37 - Unknown: Greetings My Dear Proud Edoofian! This is a reminder for your session today at 2 pm Zimbabwe Time.
10/11/22, 18:46 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Noted
10/11/22, 23:09 - Unknown: Greetings Keith! Are you ready for your session?
10/11/22, 23:14 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Yes sir we may commence
10/11/22, 23:16 - Unknown: Glad to know that Keith! How are your catch up exams going?
10/11/22, 23:34 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Aah i am hopeful the catchup reading i did will be enough for me to pass
10/11/22, 23:35 - Unknown: Are you still writing your exams?
10/11/22, 23:37 - Keith EWYL22E0690: No sir I am done now
10/11/22, 23:38 - Unknown: Okay! So, did you go through the Wednesday lesson?
10/11/22, 23:41 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Yes sir I did
10/11/22, 23:56 - Unknown: So, can you please share your understanding with me?
11/11/22, 00:00 - Keith EWYL22E0690: The Wednesday Lesson was about Self awareness, how it is about actually getting to look at yourself and assess yourself and work out a plan to work on your weakness and strength to become a better person. An example of the former president of the USA Mr Barrack Obama was given and various people were testifying to how he took time for self introspection and how it helped him in his life
11/11/22, 00:18 - Unknown: Great! So Keith, can you share your strengths and weaknesses, that you must have analyzed about your own self, and how have they played a role in building your personality of today.
11/11/22, 01:08 - Keith EWYL22E0690: My greatest weakness is social awkwardness or not being able to interact with people on the get go and I struggle with that a lot because it makes me come across as secluded or unapproachable
11/11/22, 01:10 - Keith EWYL22E0690: My strength is being able to put myself under a situation and seeing it through even when I'm working under pressure I always manage to see the other end of what I am doing
11/11/22, 01:12 - Unknown: That is really impressive, that you understand your own personality! But, do you also understand the fact that, such weakness might put you in trouble when you shall be placed in a professional setup?
11/11/22, 01:13 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Yes sir and i have been trying to work on them
11/11/22, 01:17 - Unknown: Great! We shall work on it together and try to become a better version of ourselves, every single day.
11/11/22, 01:17 - Unknown: So Keith! Are you ready to work on the Projects which we discussed in the Introductory session?
11/11/22, 01:20 - Keith EWYL22E0690: I would love that
11/11/22, 01:20 - Keith EWYL22E0690: Yes
11/11/22, 01:26 - Unknown: Great Keith! So, I would suggest you put in at least 1 hour of your day daily, on the corporate alliance and African Schools Reform Project. In the meantime, you can regularly work on community building, as a normal conversation with people can be done at any time of the day, but schools, companies, and professional places have time set to reach out and contact. I hope you get my point.
