Make sure you inform prior in case you cannot manage to be in the session.
17/12/22, 02:23 - Delight EWYL22E0571: okay ma'am I'll surely do that
17/12/22, 02:23 - Jasmine Kaur: Effective and timely feedback is a crucial part of a successful performance, as I discussed with you in our Saturday activity. I wanted to get in touch with you to share your EWYL report card and ask you to evaluate your performance by responding to the following questions:

1. How would you rate your performance from 1-10, 10 being the highest score?
2. What is your goal- in terms of skills and amount of scholarship credits that you want to earn?
3. What is your plan- how will you achieve the above mentioned goal?

The answers you give here will be evaluated by Ms Deepali and Ms Davi. So take you time and share your responses here in the group itself.
17/12/22, 02:25 - Delight EWYL22E0571: okay I will send the answers before the end of the day
17/12/22, 02:27 - Jasmine Kaur: Delight, it would be great if you could send short and crisp answers now so that we can have a discussion around the ame?
17/12/22, 02:28 - Jasmine Kaur: Same*
17/12/22, 02:43 - Delight EWYL22E0571: my performance I would rate it at 5 due to my inconsistencies but I promise to improve my performance.

My goal in terms of skills is to develop my social networking skills as well as a professional networking in order to complete my projects and attract more people towards the Edoofa Scholarship program. I also plan on improving my time management skills as well as multitasking in order to earn as many scholarship credits as possible in doing so I'll be gaining more experience.
17/12/22, 02:44 - Jasmine Kaur: What is your plan now to achieve the targets? 
What do you think should be your next step?
17/12/22, 02:49 - Delight EWYL22E0571: My plan is to set time limits to complete each and every project assigned to me
17/12/22, 02:51 - Delight EWYL22E0571: My next step is working under a lot of pressure making sure that I reach those targets I set for myself
17/12/22, 02:56 - Jasmine Kaur: I will help you with some tips:
1. Have a plan
Set goals at the beginning of the project and note the date. Have a deadline for it as well, it is good to manage the goals. Decide at the beginning how often you are going to work on the project.
2. Listen and listen
Listening in my opinion is more important than saying anything. Listen to the other person's problems and just by being there you might help the other person to think out loud and share their thoughts with you [ in reference to school headmasters and other students ].
17/12/22, 02:57 - Delight EWYL22E0571: noted
17/12/22, 02:58 - Jasmine Kaur: 3. Make time
Being a hardworking person is not easy, it consumes time, not only from the meetings but you need to prepare and do some research before every meeting. Be prepared to spend some time on this.
4. Be honest
If people ask you a question and you don’t know the answer, be honest, don’t make up an answer just to show that you are never wrong.You don’t have all the answers in the world. If you don’t know the answer for a problem, look for it, or even better, look for it together with your mentor.
17/12/22, 02:59 - Delight EWYL22E0571: understood
17/12/22, 03:49 - Jasmine Kaur: With the above 4 listed elements you can work on the projects efficiently.
Also, now as you can see I have shared your report with and I really want you to have it in your mind whenever you work on projects, activities or lessons.
17/12/22, 03:51 - Delight EWYL22E0571: yes Ms Riva, I'll keep that in mind
17/12/22, 03:58 - Jasmine Kaur: The first step we will take to move ahead is :
A] ATTENDANCE : maintain a 100 percent attendance by saying *I am a proud edoofian*
B] Lessons and activities : remember to receive your lessons on Wednesdays to build your skill set and your activities on Saturdays to use that skill set.
C] Projects : Ofcourse, this is also a major part. Fix a time in your schedule to work on your EWYL projects.

17/12/22, 21:16 - Jasmine Kaur: Sat Activity: 

Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often than not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Who would you prefer as your Secret Santa and what gift would you like to receive from them and why?

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!
18/12/22, 05:06 - Delight EWYL22E0571: I'd like my secret Santa to be my grandfather. He is one of my favorite people in the world, a warm hearted man whose selfless, generous and considerate. To be honest having him around for Christmas would be the greatest gift in the world because when he is there everything is complete. He is one person who manages to get the family to gather together on Christmas. I want nothing from him because ever since I was little he has always given me anything and everything that I wanted all I want is his presence and love which he always gives me. I really love my grandfather so much.
19/12/22, 18:15 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello, my proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well.

12/01/23, 23:14 - Jasmine Kaur: Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals towards achieving this goal. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

I would appreciate you sharing your learnings from today’s lesson.
13/01/23, 16:26 - Jasmine Kaur: Goodmorning Delight,
How are you?
13/01/23, 22:56 - Delight EWYL22E0571: good day miss, how are you
14/01/23, 00:21 - Jasmine Kaur: I am very well, thanks for asking.
17/01/23, 22:19 - Delight EWYL22E0571: I am a proud Edoofian
17/01/23, 22:21 - Jasmine Kaur: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
17/01/23, 22:36 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my lovely edoofians, hope you are doing well.

I have some amazing news and an opportunity to share with you. But first, do you know, A 2018 report by WaterAid India and Menstrual Hygiene Alliance India (MHAI) states that there are 336 million menstruating women in India, out of which only 121 million use sanitary pads. Assuming that these women use eight sanitary pads for one cycle (conservatively), a simple calculation reveals that almost one billion sanitary pads are used and disposed of every year.  The primary component in all disposable sanitary napkins is plastic. This takes approximately 500-800 years to fully disintegrate after disposal. Assuming one billion DSNs are disposed of every year, handling menstrual waste becomes a mammoth task.

And the solution to this problem is Sustainable menstruation!

Wondering what it is :

* Sustainable menstruation refers to the use of alternative products during one’s menstrual cycle for the benefit of the body and the earth.
* Sustainable menstruation is being mindful of the negative effects disposable sanitary products have on our environment in an effort to reduce the plastic waste ending up in our oceans or landfills.

I would like to invite you to our webinar on Sustainable menstruation tomorrow I.e. 18th January 2023, wherein we will be joined by Dr.Aarushi Kehar Malhotra. She will be helping us understand it better and how can each one of us be the solution to this problem.

Don’t forget to join by 5:45 PM IST, the webinar will start exactly at 6:00 PM [2:30 PM: Zimbabwean time] . Don’t be late for this webinar. Come prepared with the questions that you might have!
