My response regarding  the weekend activity

Success means doing the best we can with what we have around us. Success is the doing not the getting, it is the trying process not the triumph. Success is very simple ,one has to do what is right the right way and at the right time interval.

There are some traits that can mould one to be a successful individual in life. The first one l would like to go about is passion for what you are doing. Being passionate is  the feeling of being excited with what you're doing. In life one cannot make a living from something he\/she is not interested in. Hardwork is the  other trait which hand in hand with passion . Inorder to be successful put all your efforts towards what you want to achieve in life. In the journey to success one must learn from failure , correct yourself from the mistakes you have made in life. 

Persistence is also the most important trait one must have inorder to be successful . Endure the hard times because there are the ones that yield fruitful results in life.

If yes, what are the those and which ones do you think you need to inculcate in yourself to be successful like Gilbert Peters?
08/08/22, 19:49 - Simon EWYL21E0159: Yes sir
08/08/22, 19:52 - Simon EWYL21E0159: The ones that l have stated above l have mastered them but l think  that l should add these traits to be more successful optimism , commitment, and persistence as well
08/08/22, 20:36 - Unknown: As I mentioned earlier that continuous learning is a must for a student, and the industry leaders are a great source to learn from as their experiences and struggles can be a great source of inspiration.

13/08/22, 20:32 - Simon EWYL21E0159: From the Wednesday wisdom l learnt a lot of things in life. Firstly on the the very firstly point which said ''forget luck ,live by intent l understood nothing in life comes without me as an individual putting effort towards it. Yes in life opportunities do exist but one has to rely on his\/her willpower because we don't know when in life these opportunities will meet us .ln life the only input to the goals we dream if is hardworking.
13/08/22, 20:46 - Simon EWYL21E0159: From the second point which talked about failure l understood that failure is not the end but it is just a milestone for you to reflect that the method that you have been using towards a goal does not fits it. We have to take failure as a lesson not as punishment. Failure acknowledge us to reshuffle our methods inorder to achieve a goal

Happy New Week, my proud Edoofian! How was your weekend?
25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

Good morning sir
28/07/22, 14:57 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

Hello my proud Edoofian! Greeting of the day.
28/07/22, 21:17 - Unknown: Also, did you work on the week's Wednesday wisdom shared with you yesterday?

I personally found it very interesting as I know my students struggle with managing their time to attend university and to work on their skill building and that is why I requested Mrs Davi to create a lesson on the same.
