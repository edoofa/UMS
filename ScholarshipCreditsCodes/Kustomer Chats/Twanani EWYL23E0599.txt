06/10/23, 13:49 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofians,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning

I hope this message finds you well. Today's "Wednesday Wisdom" session will delve into the topic of peak performance and the significance of focus in achieving success. We've all heard experts advise us to concentrate, eliminate distractions, and commit to mastering one thing. This guidance is undoubtedly valuable, and the more I study successful individuals from various fieldsâ€”be it artists, athletes, entrepreneurs, or scientistsâ€”the more I am convinced that focus plays a pivotal role in their accomplishments.

Together, we'll explore strategies and ideas that can help you navigate the complex landscape of choices and find your true calling.
Read the PDF very carefully and we will connect in our upcoming session.

Till Then
Happy Learning!
