20/03/23, 17:42 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my proud Edoofian!

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!","transform":"

Okay from the last lesson we were discussing about the Principles that can help to achieve success in any area of life, not just financially



We first talked about Decision
The most successful people in this world make wise decisions fast and definitely. And those who doesn't always struggle to make them and they are easier to be persuaded by the opinion of others. We should learn to trust our very own decisions and if we need help, we can or must acquire it from trustworthy sources.

Persistence
This one stated that it is built upon the strength of will. Most people give up when things become too challenging. So by persistence and putting some concentration and effort, one can easily overcome the burdens

The Power of Mastermind
To accumulate money one need power because without power you cannot put your plans into action
Hill stated that there are 3 ways of accumulating money:-
     1-Infinite Intelligence
     2-Accumulated Experience
     3-Experiment and Research
Knowledge is converted into power by organizing it into definite plans. As they say two is better than one, a collection of minds produces results far better than the sum of parts
