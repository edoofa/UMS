19/05/23, 19:02 - Humphrey EWYL21E0656: To share the little that i got from yesterday's call.
There was a question imposed why is necessary to know each other before we got to India.
It comes with a great advantage because we start to make friends while you still in your Country and then when you meet in India you will be familiar with one another.

Thats all i got from from yesterday as i was not able to have more time on the session
22/05/23, 15:28 - Humphrey EWYL21E0656: Am a proud edoofian
22/05/23, 15:28 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Alex who loved playing the piano. Despite facing financial hardships, he practiced on an old, worn-out piano every day. His passion and dedication led him to enter a prestigious music competition.

Now, it's time for a quick quiz to test your comprehension of Alex's motivational story:

What did Alex's passion and dedication lead him to?
a) Winning a sports competition
b) Receiving an art scholarship
c) Participating in a theater production
d) Entering a prestigious music competition
22/05/23, 15:28 - Humphrey EWYL21E0656: It comes with a great honour and privilege to talk about leadership as most people dream about being leaders one day.
From the list of 3 projects that am assigned to do, for i to keep on practicing and strengthening my leadership skills, i will go for corparate alliance  and African  reformed mission.
To detail my choices i  will start by African reform mission, in this case i will be meeting with different types of school heads who have a lot of knowledge and experience. I will have to be brave and confindence and know how to put my points in  crystal manner.
As time goes i will boost my inner self and become unstoppable.
Corparate Alliance will enable me to advance my networking skills and help me meet new people using difference network. And it will also strengthen my interactive skills. Being a leader comes with great responsibility and am ready to take it.

29/05/23, 14:48 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
