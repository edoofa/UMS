22/12/22, 07:14 - Munashe EWYL22E0606: Well sir for my family on Christmas Day we attend a short church service which we partake from 0900am to 1000am . We attend the church service dressed in whichever clothes family members choose to wear for some they choose to go to church dressed in their new clothes and some go to church dressed in their normal clothes but usually my family members attend church with their ordinary clothes then after attending church that is from past 1100am we come back home and jump into our new clothes and get on the roads because Christmas is that one day we are always looking forward to for the whole year because my parents always have a beautiful destination for us and so we visit the beautiful place and spend time there the likes of this December I have heard my parents saying we should invite our friends for a Christmas outing to Osborne dam and they will pay for their admission. The reason for my parents having to invite people is not to seek attention but they always say it's not Christmas if you don't get to bring some sparkles into someone's life so each year we always try to incorporate many other people to enjoy Christmas with them for example last year my mother bought boxes of Christmas hampers and stocked them at our shops and said every customer should receive one for themselves and this even made Christmas for everyone including the homeless people who walked in our shop to purchase  small items as little as a dandy . That is how my family and I always celebrate our Christmas sir

23/12/22, 05:10 - Munashe EWYL22E0606: 1. From the webinar well sir I learnt that

Brand development is the creative process of generating new economic ideas which can be accomplished through ideation techniques.

Some of the ideation the h
23/12/22, 05:39 - Munashe EWYL22E0606: Some of the ideation techniques are
1. brainstorming ( carrying out market research on the type of business and product)
prototyping (drawing the idea to have better understanding of the business or product)
3.Reverse brainstorming ( seeking for future problems which might affect the flourishing of the business and or product and the community and try finding solutions to them e.g. global warming)
4. Mind mapping ( the key factor of business ideation,where one has to put himself into the customers' shoes and ask himself\/herself if they would be willing to support the business were they customers and not producers.

*Strategies to business ideation*

1. Design thinking ( finding problem being faced in the community)
2. Analyze your idea ( generate a solution and think of how it would make money for you .
3. Business value ( is it making profits i.e. for a business to be viable it has to be profit making)
4. Demand ( research on availability of market for the product)
5. Skill and dependency ( compose a team to work with you towards achieving your goal)
6. Compliance ( People's willingness to work with you , think of how you will start your business) 


*Business development*

It is a process of distinguishing your company's brand from others'.

*Strategies*

1.Consider your overall business strategy
2. Identify your target clients
3. Research your target client group
4. Develop your brand positioning
5. Develop your messaging strategies ( mission and statement) 
6. Develop your name,logo and tagline
7. Develop your website
8. Build your marketing tool (e.g. social media, flyers, banners) in tandem with market structures.
9. Implement, track and adjust ( carry out the business and track progress also don't be discouraged by hurting feedbacks by people)

15/12/22, 16:33 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
