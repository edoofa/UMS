16/03/23, 21:37 - Saloni Rastogi: I am sharing the Wednesday lesson with you below:
16/03/23, 21:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian,
This week's Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the topic of \"Seeking Wealth, not Money or Status.\" This is an important lesson that will provide valuable insights into the pursuit of financial stability and success. During this lesson, we will explore the concept of wealth and its importance in building a sustainable financial future. We will discuss the difference between wealth, money, and status, and how each of these concepts plays a role in our lives.
I encourage you to read the lesson in detail and take notes to fully understand the material. It is important to engage with this topic and think critically about your own financial goals and aspirations.
By understanding the importance of seeking wealth over money or status, you can develop a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial success. I look forward to exploring this topic with you in more detail during our upcoming lesson.

Happy learning!

17/03/23, 19:08 - Saloni Rastogi: I apologise for leaving our conversation in between yesterday.
I got an urgent call from one of our Edoofian in India and it took me some time to resolve his challenge.
17/03/23, 19:08 - Saloni Rastogi: I hope that we can connect for our session Today?
17/03/23, 22:31 - Rosemary EWYL22E0409: I understand
17/03/23, 22:32 - Rosemary EWYL22E0409: Sure
17/03/23, 22:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Rosemary, May I know what did we discuss in our last session?
17/03/23, 22:47 - Rosemary EWYL22E0409: This week's Wednesday wisdom lesson focused on the topic of seeking wealth not money or status
17/03/23, 22:48 - Rosemary EWYL22E0409: I will share my understanding later today
17/03/23, 22:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, I was referring to our active session before that
17/03/23, 22:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, Please share your understandings regarding the Wednesday lesson with me
17/03/23, 22:56 - Rosemary EWYL22E0409: The lesson was focusing on the importance of investing in assets as they   don't require your involvement all the time. It also points out that money is the mode of exchange which is used to earn wealth.
17/03/23, 22:56 - Rosemary EWYL22E0409: It was on my understanding regarding the Christmas celebrations
17/03/23, 22:58 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very happy to see your response.
Money is a medium of exchange, wealth is an accumulation of assets that generate income over time, and status is a social position or level of prestige. Each of these concepts has its own unique characteristics and importance in our lives.
I am sure that now, You will be looking towards wealth generation. The first step in this would be ensure the best academic journey for yourself.

Good morning Mr Rithvik
20/03/23, 19:24 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

I am sharing the Saturday Activity with you below:
21/03/23, 19:07 - Saloni Rastogi: SATURDAY ACTIVITY:

Hello my proud Edoofian!

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!
21/03/23, 19:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Since, You received it late, Therefore, I am extending the deadline for you.

17/11/22, 05:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Wednesday Lesson

Hello, my dear proud Edoofian. I hope all is well with you.

Another insightful Wednesday Wisdom is presented here. The lesson today teaches us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, disability. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition. A few questions near the end of the session will ask you to reflect and have an open dialogue with yourself. After you finish your lesson, as your mentor, I'd like to have a thorough conversation about your key take aways, in our upcoming sessions.

Enjoy the article and keep in mind that success does not come to you suddenly; rather, it can be attained over time by making modest, daily improvements.

Happy learning!

17/11/22, 18:17 - Saloni Rastogi: We will be having our session at 3:00 PM Indian Time i.e. 11:30 AM Zimb Time Tomorrow
Before, We start with our session tomorrow, I would like you to go through some important information that I am sharing below:
17/11/22, 18:17 - Saloni Rastogi: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages. Let us get a better understanding of the three stages!

Your counselor is your first point of contact. Your counselor has been guiding you during your onboarding process where you learnt about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your Admissions Officer {Miss Vilsha\/Mr. Milan}.I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now you must be aware that all your admissions related queries like: your VISA process, Registration fees, AAL etc. would be addressed\/handled by the Admissions Team. 
Note: Your EWYL mentor\/counselor will not be addressing your admission queries
Finally you will be starting your EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor, where you get a chance to learn 21st century job skills and earn your scholarship credits which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
17/11/22, 18:27 - Rosemary EWYL22E0409: No queries for now

16/12/22, 14:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We will be starting with our session Today at 3:00 PM Indian Time I.e. 11:30 AM Zimb Time

Till then, Please make sure that you have completed all the things that I mentioned in the message yesterday

16/12/22, 20:22 - Saloni Rastogi: It is time for our session
17/12/22, 21:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, 
_I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?_

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!

Since You have not performed the Proud Edoofian Ritual yesterday morning, Therefore, I was not able to share the Wednesday Lesson with you.
06/01/23, 18:05 - Saloni Rastogi: *Wednesday Lesson | 4 Jan*

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy Learning!
06/01/23, 18:06 - Saloni Rastogi: You can share your response after our session Today
06/01/23, 18:07 - Rosemary EWYL22E0409: I am a Proud Edoofian'

I am sharing some messages with you below, Please have a look at them.
The first one is the Saturday Activity and the second is the new Student Application Form that you have to use from now on for the Community Building Project.
Feel free to share any queries that you have regarding this.
We will discuss them in detail in our next session.
Have a cheerful day ahead!
16/01/23, 22:36 - Saloni Rastogi: The ability to solve problems is a basic life skill and is essential to our day-to-day lives, at home, at school, and at work. We solve problems every day without really thinking about how we solve them. For example: it’s raining and you need to go to the store. What do you do? There are lots of possible solutions. Take your umbrella and walk. If you don't want to get wet, you can drive, or take the bus. There is no right way to solve this problem and different people will solve it differently. However in our Wednesday wisdom we learnt about some Problem solving strategies. As part of your Saturday activity, I want you to share with us a problem that you encountered very recently and how did you Solve It. Did you use any strategy that was similar to what Munger has talked about?

Looking forward to your responses!
