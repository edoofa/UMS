17/12/22, 20:13 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!

Do you agree on this Ndapiwa?
14/07/22, 22:26 - Unknown: I will certainly share the credits with you as well Ndapiwa.

15/07/22, 00:56 - Ndapiwa EWYL21E0509: Yes sir I do believe.
15/07/22, 01:14 - Unknown: So, do you believe you are able to utilize the opportunity that the EWYL program creates for you? Are you able to fully leverage your opportunity to self fund your higher education?
15/07/22, 01:32 - Ndapiwa EWYL21E0509: Yes sir I do believe.
15/07/22, 01:33 - Ndapiwa EWYL21E0509: Yes sir I do believe.
15/07/22, 01:55 - Unknown: Now to put this in action, you must increase your work on the EWYL projects Ndapiwa. You have to be more active on the community building project because you have the potential in you. I see it.

16/07/22, 01:54 - Ndapiwa EWYL21E0509: I understand very well sir and I am going to pull up my socks

16/07/22, 03:41 - Unknown: This is good Ndapiwa.
16/07/22, 03:42 - Unknown: Also Ndapiwa. Since you are working on the school connect project, I want you to work on the follower task of the project as well. 

You must share 5 followers for both skooqs instagram and facebook.
16/07/22, 03:47 - Ndapiwa EWYL21E0509: Ok sir so I should look for the posts on skooqs Instagram and bring followers right?
16/07/22, 04:38 - Ndapiwa EWYL21E0509: The person is Chaplin Maeresera
16/07/22, 18:30 - Ndapiwa EWYL21E0509: I am proud Edoofian
16/07/22, 18:32 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

18/07/22, 23:16 - Unknown: Great Ndapiwa,  Let me first help you understand what SWOT Analysis is.

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment.This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organisations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
19/07/22, 00:11 - Ndapiwa EWYL21E0509: Okok yaeh I am getting the sense sir ,,I understand.
19/07/22, 00:18 - Unknown: Ndapiwa,As seen above, SWOT is an acronym of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. However, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym:

1 Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
2 Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
3 Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
4 Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by
19/07/22, 00:21 - Ndapiwa EWYL21E0509: I understand sir.
19/07/22, 01:14 - Unknown: You know why SWOT Analysis is important? It can help you to challenge risky assumptions and to uncover dangerous blindspots about your organization's performance. If you use it carefully and collaboratively, it can deliver new insights on where your business currently is, and help you to develop exactly the right strategy for any situation.
19/07/22, 01:14 - Unknown: Ndapiwa, For example, you may be well aware of some of your organization's strengths, but until you record them alongside weaknesses and threats you might not realize how unreliable those strengths actually are.

Equally, you likely have reasonable concerns about some of your business weaknesses but, by going through the analysis systematically, you could find an opportunity, previously overlooked, that could more than compensate.
19/07/22, 01:20 - Ndapiwa EWYL21E0509: Yes sir so it means things need to be recorded so that you can analyse
19/07/22, 01:24 - Unknown: Now, What Are the Biggest SWOT Analysis Mistakes that people make?
19/07/22, 01:38 - Ndapiwa EWYL21E0509: I think they don't identify weakness and strengths as well as recording them ,sir
19/07/22, 01:43 - Unknown: Interesting Ndapiwa,
19/07/22, 01:45 - Unknown: Here are what I believe that people make mistakes with:
19/07/22, 01:45 - Unknown: 1 Making your lists too long. Ask yourself if your ideas are feasible as you go along.
2 Being vague. Be specific to provide more focus for later discussions.
3. Not seeing weaknesses. Be sure to ask customers and colleagues what they experience in real life.
4. Not thinking ahead. It's easy to come up with nice ideas without taking them through to their logical conclusion. Always consider their practical impact.
5 Being unrealistic. Don't plan in detail for opportunities that don't exist yet.
19/07/22, 01:56 - Ndapiwa EWYL21E0509: I understand sir ,,and I have captured
19/07/22, 02:11 - Unknown: Great ndapiwa, with this in mind, keep working on the projects now.
19/07/22, 02:12 - Unknown: Also Ndapiwa, Everyone at team Edoofa is super excited to see you here in India soon. This will be a big step that you are taking towards your successful careers ahead. I would like to inform you of a special session being organized for your efficient travel preparation and smooth integration to LPU campus.
