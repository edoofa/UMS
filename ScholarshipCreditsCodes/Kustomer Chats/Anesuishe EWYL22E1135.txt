Comment if you have been working on the community building project and how many aspiring Edoofians have enrolled through you!
28/06/23, 16:34 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

01/07/23, 15:57 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!

This is only a negative statement from a negative minded being.When one comes to this end , we know for sure life has made you taste lemons ,life has thrown it's best tantrums and only the bold will Soildier up. When l finished my A'level l wanted to be a lawyer .l knew l have nailed it , l didn't even for once think l have failed my exams.My dream was to be a lawyer and l envisioned myself as one.When results came and l didn't come up with what l expected ,l broke down, l couldn't face reality that my dream was shattered how can l become a lawyer then. However with the zeal l had for law l applied various polytechnic and they saw my potential. At this moment l realise a dream without hardwork will never come to existance.Realisation came to me that inorder to be a Successful lawyer ,inorder to live your dream one has to work towards it. One has to focus ,l started researching on all that is need for one to fulfill the desire to be a lawyer.All the characteristics that surround a good lawyer . 

As the days went by , l realised l wanted my career path to have an impact to everyone.l want to be successful. It is then Edoofa Scholarship program gives me lights .On this journey l have started ,l will move with boldness and determination.Not forgetting a dream without hardwork is just another imagination.Inorder to live one's dream ,you have to be willing to work hard and give your all in it. Taking charge for my life , Yes knowing that life is not only about living to your best but fulfilling your purpose ,touching lives and living a remarkable life.

We spend much of our precious time in a dilemma , whining, wondering what life has thrown at our doorsteps . Yes , go ahead do not put anything into motion ,sleep ,cry ,hide in a closed room , do not smile . You're an ultimate crazy numbskull this is exactly what l told my self when l feel like l am giving up.

I will never give up , future Attorney Anesuishe

By focusing on consistency,you're laying the foundation for long term success.Consistency in preparing for your exams can make you happy for your entire life , also a remarkable memory you will always be proud of.

*Example 1:*
The power of consistency in body fitness..In this regard, consistency refers to making body fitness routine  a top priority.
Consistency makes one endure, it makes one stronger , consistency makes one get results.

*Example 2:*
This is hilarious to know that even a skin routine needs consistency .Yes , beauty can be attained by being consistent to your skin and beauty routine.It is the key to noticeable results.


*Most importantly through the Wednesday Wisdom, l came to realisation that , consistency is self- motivation,it yields success.Be it in my career path ,if l need progress,l need to be consistent throughout my studies.As a proud Edoofian , if l be consistent in the EWYL program,l will definitely breed progress and strengthen relationships with my mentor.I understood that , consistency alone can bring attention to my image and nurtures credibility even from my other peers and the Edoofa board at large.Thank you , from today onwards l will practise consistency.*

Indeed , consistency is the critical driver to success. I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN. #Wednesday Wisdom.

06/07/23, 14:19 - Anesuishe EWYL22E1135: Most of these students are L6 , let me clarify on that ma'am.
Will resend them after a steady look ma'am.
06/07/23, 14:30 - Jasmine Kaur: I would like to draw your attention to a few important matters. Currently, the admissions for the year 2025 have not yet commenced. Therefore, it is crucial that you refrain from submitting any forms for the 2025 batch at this time. However, I have an alternate suggestion that can prove beneficial. Gather all the 2025 forms in one designated location and engage with those students. Your primary objective should be to address any queries or concerns they may have, while also providing them with the necessary guidance and motivation to pursue their aspirations in India.

By following this approach, you can ensure that not a single form goes to waste. Rest assured, as soon as the 2025 admissions open, I will promptly inform you, enabling you to submit all the 2025 forms in a consolidated manner.
06/07/23, 14:30 - Jasmine Kaur: Since all these 3 forms are of 2025. So none of them will be considered dear.
06/07/23, 14:31 - Jasmine Kaur: As we conclude our session, I would like to provide you with a weekend target.
