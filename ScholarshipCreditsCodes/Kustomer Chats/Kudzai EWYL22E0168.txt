11/08/22, 16:39 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

It is easy to dream and imagine being successful in our life but the journey of this victory is really a challenging one. I really adore the dedication, and hardwork of the business man he understood that things might not work at for a while but it won't be forever hence not giving up is one thing we should do
