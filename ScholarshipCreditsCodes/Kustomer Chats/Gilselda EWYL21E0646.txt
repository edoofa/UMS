While going through our conversation, I noticed that you haven't submitted *Wednesday's Lesson* yet.
The deadline to make the submission is *Thursday* *6 PM*. Please make sure that you submit your response before that because the *Academic Board* keeps a very strict check on these things. 
 
The aim of this activity is to make you aware of the life journey of Patrice Motsepe and how you can inculcate his traits in your daily life.
15/07/22, 17:30 - Unknown: I also noticed that from a long time, You haven't submitted any audio lessons or activities.
Please let me know if you are facing any challenges.
Proud Edoofian, These are not the things that could be taught to someone in school or university but these are very important from your life and career perspective.
This is why these audio lessons and activities become more important.

25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
