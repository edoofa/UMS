Greeting of the day my proud edoofian! How are you doing?
15/07/22, 21:07 - Albert EWYL22E0250: Am doing good
15/07/22, 21:07 - Albert EWYL22E0250: How are you
15/07/22, 21:07 - Unknown: I understand the challenges Albert.
15/07/22, 21:07 - Unknown: Did you work on the Wednesday wisdom task I shared with you yesterday Edoofian?

Personally I found it very interesting as it discussed the life and struggles of Patrice, an African Billionaire and I believe my students should take inspiration from him.
15/07/22, 22:02 - Albert EWYL22E0250: Yes am done
15/07/22, 22:03 - Albert EWYL22E0250: Check in the EWYL group
15/07/22, 22:45 - Albert EWYL22E0250: This story of Patrice Motsepe teaches us students and everyone a lot. Motsepe got interested in mining and he put all his efforts and inputs in order to get information about mining. He was also raised by his father who owned a tuckshop but look now he became successful. This lesson teaches us that nothing comes in an easy way ,it inspires us and encourages us to be open minded. We need to work hard by all means in order to achieve our goals. This story also teaches us that your background does not define your future, you can be poor now but if you work hard you can have a bright future regardless of your skin, nature, country or background
16/07/22, 00:01 - Unknown: Amazing work on the Lesson task. I saw that Patrice had the wisdom to recognize and grab the opportunities that time brought for him and that is what set him apart from others and made him who he is.

Do you agree on this Edoofian?
16/07/22, 00:16 - Albert EWYL22E0250: Absolutely correct
16/07/22, 00:31 - Unknown: Now recognizing and grabbing the opportunities that come at hand is crucial. Do you believe you do that as well?
16/07/22, 00:46 - Albert EWYL22E0250: Yes Sir
16/07/22, 00:51 - Unknown: So, do you believe you are able to utilize the opportunity that the EWYL program creates for you? Are you able to fully leverage your opportunity to self fund your higher education?
16/07/22, 00:55 - Albert EWYL22E0250: Thats my everyday goal
16/07/22, 01:18 - Unknown: So Albert, this is time to make significant progress on the community building project and other EWYL projects to bring in schools and talk to company managers. 

You simply can't afford to miss out on this opportunity because you have to work hard to build your future and become successful. These projects enable you to do that.
16/07/22, 01:22 - Albert EWYL22E0250: Exactly , am working on them
16/07/22, 01:27 - Unknown: Yes Albert.
16/07/22, 01:28 - Unknown: Now you should aim for tangible progress on the project considering that you are aiming to build your skills and self fund your education Right?
16/07/22, 01:33 - Albert EWYL22E0250: Yes,  noted
25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
26/07/22, 19:18 - Albert EWYL22E0250: The story of the sea and the sailor is baised on success. Successful people don't don't blame the world for their loss or failures. It is a lesson for me and others on how to be successful and responsible at the same time. This has taught me that good things don't just come easily,  you don't need to wait and relax waiting for your future. Future is what you create for your own tomorrow. I myself I am now dedicated to build my future, no matter what comes in  my way I won't stop, all the rejections and failures will make me stronger and gain the spirit of fighting. My mind needs to be open, confidence and self esteem are my motto. You don't need to blame anyone for your failure or talk to people in a rude manner buh you just need to take responsibility for everything that occurs in your life.
