14/01/23, 17:34 - Aditi Kapoor: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

I am a proud Edoofian!
16/01/23, 09:47 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0925: I am really grateful to Mr Angad Singh motivational words.Us as teenagers we are likely to suffer from peer pressure looking at what other people of our age are doing usually ruins our lives.Some get involved into drugs therefore as Mr Singh said getting to spend your time with people older than you will help one to experiance life.Usually we are really afraid of loosing friends but l have come to understand  that it is somehow helpful to get rid of the friends who have no future plans.And also finding a mentor no matter how brave or intelligent one always make mistakes therefore it is really wise to have someone to correct your mistakes and also someone who helps in your decision making.l have learnt a lot in this newsletter and l am looking forward to another interesting newsletter.

20/01/23, 04:22 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0925: Wednesday wisdom HOW TO ASK GOOD QUESTIONS 

As l went through the document l have learnt  quite a lot.For one to ask a good question it is wise to first get to study and know the person being asked,according to my understanding this helps one to know the feelings and the emotions of the person being asked and also for the questioner it helps him or her to know the kind of questions to ask.Secondly one should be a good listener and to ask the questions one will enjoy.Being a good listener means that the questioner must not always interrupt the one being asked.This will only leave the person bored as they are not given chance to speak.Also to keep the conversation going one should avoid asking empty questions.Another thing l have learnt is never to overload questions.This will only leave the person answering the questions confused and not knowing the right question to answer first.This will lead to distortion of some information. The questioner must creat a hierachy to know the question to ask next.

This is what l understood from the Wednesday wisdom.

However Mr Maurice l have a question, on number 4 its stating to never lead the questions.Can you give me a clarification on that.
04/03/23, 23:21 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0925: I am a proud Edoofian!

03/04/23, 18:47 - Aditi Kapoor: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!
