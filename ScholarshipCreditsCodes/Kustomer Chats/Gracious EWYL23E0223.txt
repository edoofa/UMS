We hope this message finds you well in your academic pursuits. We are excited to share a Saturday activity centered around learning from influential personalities. Our chosen figure is Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of Liberia and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Through her remarkable leadership and unwavering determination, she has left an indelible mark on history. Let's draw valuable lessons from her life for our personal development.

Two traits that stand out about Ellen Johnson Sirleaf are resilience and visionary leadership. These qualities can greatly contribute to our growth and development as individuals. They can positively impact our academic pursuits, relationships, and future career goals.

To develop resilience, we can learn from Sirleaf's ability to bounce back from challenges. We can seek out difficult experiences and learn from them, cultivating a mindset of perseverance and adaptability.

Here are some suggestions to help you get started:

Identify two traits: Reflect on Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's qualities that resonate with you.

Reflect on personal development: Consider how these traits can positively impact your academic pursuits, relationships, or future career goals.

Create an action plan: Outline practical steps like seeking mentorship, practicing self-discipline, engaging in community service, or pursuing relevant courses and extracurricular activities.
Let's embark on this exciting journey together and make Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's legacy an integral part of our own lives.
Best regards,

Team Edoofa

Its time for our Saturday Activity, I want you to delve into the realm of inspiration and write a detailed essay about a person whom you know personally and who embodies the remarkable trait of consistency. This individual has consistently demonstrated their dedication, determination, and unwavering commitment, becoming a true source of inspiration for you.

In your essay, please explore the key aspects of their life, experiences, and actions that exemplify their consistent nature. Describe how their consistent approach has positively influenced and impacted not only their own life but also the lives of those around them. Reflect on specific instances or situations where their consistent behavior or mindset has motivated you to strive for excellence or overcome challenges in your own life.

Feel free to include personal anecdotes, observations, or conversations that highlight the impact this person's consistency has had on your growth and development. Additionally, analyze the qualities, values, or strategies that you believe contribute to their ability to maintain consistency over time.
I am excited to read your insightful essays and learn about the inspiring individuals who have demonstrated the power of consistency.
Best regards,
Team EWYL
08/07/23, 14:27 - Gracious EWYL23E0223: When am l to hand in the essay
09/07/23, 18:40 - Gracious EWYL23E0223: *MY SOURCE OF INSPIRATION*
Everyone has their own views and perspective in that we see the world differently meaning what inspires us to go on day by day is also very different too. As for me my inspiration comes from the woman who brought me into this world that is my mother. She is the only one who has always been breathing down my neck to ensure that l do well all the time. She is the only person in the whole world who has supported  and motivated me to achieve my dreams and goals even when l feel like giving up in life. My mom has walked with me through thick and thin without leaving my side no matter what and she actually taught me to see and believe in dreams so as she inspired me to achieve endeavor. This is all because of the fact that my dad died when l was still six and ever since she works hard so as to make sure that she provides all the necessities we need as her children so that we do not feel left out in any way. She plays both the role of a mother and a father in our lives which most single parents fail to do for they lose hope once their spouse passes away. I am sure that she does not only shine her light upon us as her children only but l believe that she motivates a lot of people around us that in what they do one should never give up rather they should thrive for the best in whatever they do to achieve their goals. All this makes my mom my very own advisor and best friend in whom l can confide in about anything knowing that her response will give me the courage to tackle any obstacle that comes my way. I think my mom has her consistent character because she is hardworking, self-confident and above all she is optimistic, minor setbacks or roadblocks do not stop her from achieving wht she wants.

10/07/23, 15:48 - Ananya: It's truly heartwarming to hear about the strong source of inspiration and support that your mother provides in your life. Mothers often play a pivotal role in shaping our values, beliefs, and aspirations. It's evident that your mother's dedication and love have had a profound impact on your personal growth and determination.

27/07/23, 15:35 - Ananya: I am good. So, yesterday's Wednesday lesson was about someone whom I personally admire a lot! Aman Gupta is an incredibly talented young boy. What did you think about him? Did you read about him?
27/07/23, 15:41 - Gracious EWYL23E0223: I didn't get the chance to do so because we are having electricity and network problems
27/07/23, 15:41 - Gracious EWYL23E0223: Can l read it today?
27/07/23, 15:44 - Ananya: Alright, you can read it today! Kindly share your understanding with me by the end of the day. Is that alright?

27/07/23, 15:48 - Ananya: Gracious, you know, yesterday we had a meeting with Angad Sir, and as a whole team, we were planning to introduce some external projects! I'm sharing this information with my students early because these external projects will be considered as valuable experience when they pursue their future dream jobs!
These projects will only be offered to students who have excelled in the EWYL journey and previous projects, as they demonstrate dedication and consistency. So, I think it's essential for us to start preparing as soon as possible. Together, we will brainstorm creative ways to maintain our positive reputation and excellent record. What are your thoughts on this?
27/07/23, 18:28 - Gracious EWYL23E0223: I think it's a great idea and I'm looking forward to doing my best
28/07/23, 15:27 - Gracious EWYL23E0223: Good afternoon ma'am we have been facing network problems so l just downloaded the pdf and audio today
So l think that Aman Gupta is a very optimistic and competitive person who strived to make his business a success and from what l read it shows that he has strategic marketing skills that made Boat go to greater heights and that he endured a lot of competition to be where he is
