13/10/23, 15:39 - Natalie EWYL23E0556: Mam l was asking if l finish the projects that you gave me so that l will reduce pressure.
13/10/23, 15:39 - Saloni Rastogi: There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.

There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*

Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
13/10/23, 15:40 - Natalie EWYL23E0556: Oky l understand, thank you Mam.

13/10/23, 15:55 - Saloni Rastogi: That is great, now I would like to inform you about something.

Since project one is on hold due to some technical reconstruction and development, we have the chance to explore our hands-on Community building and African school project.
13/10/23, 15:56 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know out of these two, which one would you like to dwell and focus more on for the coming weeks?
13/10/23, 15:58 - Natalie EWYL23E0556: Community building.
13/10/23, 16:01 - Saloni Rastogi: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
13/10/23, 16:02 - Saloni Rastogi: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*

For eg: In your case, it will be-

*Natalie/Saloni/13OCT2023*
13/10/23, 16:02 - Saloni Rastogi: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
13/10/23, 16:02 - Saloni Rastogi: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
13/10/23, 16:02 - Saloni Rastogi: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
13/10/23, 16:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
13/10/23, 16:09 - Natalie EWYL23E0556: Oky Mam l have understood.
13/10/23, 16:14 - Saloni Rastogi: So today's task will be that you form a group and add everyone!
13/10/23, 16:14 - Natalie EWYL23E0556: Oky Ma
13/10/23, 16:14 - Natalie EWYL23E0556: *m
13/10/23, 16:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Natalie, you can add all A Level class mates and O - level friends.

We re accepting student application forms for all the students who are expected to come to India in 2024 and 2025.
13/10/23, 16:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Just share the link of your WhatsApp group in all the unofficial groups.
13/10/23, 16:18 - Natalie EWYL23E0556: Oky l will surely do.
13/10/23, 16:23 - Natalie EWYL23E0556: So l will have to add you in the group.
13/10/23, 16:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, add me in the group as well, it will help me in tracking.
