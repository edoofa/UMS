 You are required to explore the concept of ecopreneurship and investigate prevailing environmental problems in your local community. In your submission, 
a. you should focus on identifying the causes and impacts of these problems, and 
b. possible solutions to mitigate them.

I will be looking forward to some detailed responses from your end, don‚Äôt forget to think like a Leader!

02/05/23, 18:23 - Tenzin: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.

Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell:

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges.
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
 3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
02/05/23, 18:27 - Sibongile EWYL23E0041: 4
02/05/23, 18:39 - Sibongile EWYL23E0041: *Desire*  
* If you hold onto your desire you will attain what you want.
 *Six steps in think and grow rich* 
*Firstly you have to describe how much money you have,you have to determine what is date,create a plan on how your Goal can be achieved.
*_Faith_* 
*In order to increase our self-confidence think and grow big suggests us to*
*Know that we are capable
*Have dominating thoughts 
*Forcus on increasing your sense of self-confidence
*Write down a description of your goal
*Then realize that you can not have enduring success if you attained it through immoral means.
*Auto-suggestions* 
*You have to influence the subconscious by:
 Find a quiet place
 Repeat 
 Place a written statement.
*Specialized knowledge* 
*Experience and observation is needed.
*Imagination*
The workshop of the mind
*Organized planing*
The crystallization of desire into action
The one I have found easiest to apply is imagination,faith and desire and the one I have found difficult to apply is  *Auto- suggestions*  cause it is the bridge between the conscious and sub conscious mind of which it has no impact on reading words loudly

06/05/23, 17:49 - Sibongile EWYL23E0041: *Wednesday wisdom* 
*The most valuable skill that is hard to come by the ability to critically think through problems.
* Having  thoughts of thinking critically through problems can actually lessen them and have more free time, if not instead you will spend most of your time fixing mistakes.
*Note* good decisions make the future easy and bad ones makes it harder.
*How to learn to think better* 
*Distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information 
*Note* 
Thinking is simply means concentrating on one thing long enough to develop an idea about it.
*Do not memorize information
*Give a chance and let the mind come to play
*Clear thinking gives poor thinking nowhere to hide 
*Concentrating, sticking to one thing, being patient, letting all the parts of the mind coming to play

So can you tell me which project have we been discussing so that we can carry on from there
12/05/23, 16:24 - Sibongile EWYL23E0041: The cooperate alliance but I was asking for some help sir
12/05/23, 16:25 - Sibongile EWYL23E0041: And the one for involving students but I had some struggles which i discussed with you the other day

12/05/23, 16:50 - Sibongile EWYL23E0041: The ones for involving our fellow students of which I said most of them have already applied already to other universities like the university of Zambia is offering a 100 basary to study so most of the former students are there, and you also said that they are accepting forms till 2024 only ,
My next challenge is that I might need some help and guidance (step by step)when I find a company I did last time
12/05/23, 17:51 - Tenzin: Alright then, can you tell me up till which part have we done for the cooperate alliance project?
12/05/23, 17:55 - Sibongile EWYL23E0041: I just researched on a particular company that's where I ended from there I couldn't pull through for I needed guidance since it's my first project
12/05/23, 18:03 - Tenzin: Alright let us start over again then
12/05/23, 18:03 - Tenzin: Today we're going to talk about how to find student-centric SMEs in Africa using Google and LinkedIn. Are you familiar with these tools?
12/05/23, 18:03 - Sibongile EWYL23E0041: Sure thing sir
12/05/23, 18:04 - Sibongile EWYL23E0041: No sir
12/05/23, 18:04 - Tenzin: No worries, we'll go through it step by step. Let's start with Google. When you're searching for student-centric SMEs in Africa, what keywords do you think you should use?
12/05/23, 18:07 - Sibongile EWYL23E0041: The best students-centric SMEs
12/05/23, 18:11 - Tenzin: That's a good start. You could also try "student-centered SMEs in Africa" or "African startups focused on education". Once you have a list of relevant startups, the next step is to find the company officials on LinkedIn. Have you used LinkedIn before?
12/05/23, 18:13 - Sibongile EWYL23E0041: I have only made in account but I have not used it
12/05/23, 18:14 - Sibongile EWYL23E0041: And I think I did not make my profile with proper details
12/05/23, 18:19 - Tenzin: Oh, well you have to have a decent profile
12/05/23, 18:21 - Sibongile EWYL23E0041: Can I please have some tips on how to display my profile
