03/03/23, 17:06 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Takudzwa!
How are you?
03/03/23, 17:07 - Aditi Kapoor: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
03/03/23, 17:07 - Aditi Kapoor: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
03/03/23, 17:07 - Aditi Kapoor: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
03/03/23, 17:07 - Aditi Kapoor: Are you ready for the journey?
03/03/23, 22:58 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1015: yes l'm ready
03/03/23, 23:05 - Aditi Kapoor: That's great!
03/03/23, 23:05 - Aditi Kapoor: Please take note of your session time and date.
03/03/23, 23:06 - Aditi Kapoor: So, may I know on which project will you work on for the month of March?

04/03/23, 20:53 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Takudzwa!
How are you?
04/03/23, 20:54 - Aditi Kapoor: Please follow the daily ritual for today, Takudzwa.
04/03/23, 20:54 - Aditi Kapoor: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
04/03/23, 20:54 - Aditi Kapoor: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
04/03/23, 20:54 - Aditi Kapoor: In our scheduled session on Tuesday we will discuss how we can best do the community-building project.
04/03/23, 20:54 - Aditi Kapoor: Till then, have a great weekend!

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

We will be connected TOMORROW for our session where we will discuss:
1) Weekend activity

06/03/23, 23:58 - Aditi Kapoor: Please excuse me for the late reply. By the time you texted, it was quite late in India. Let me highlight the time difference here in India, it is 03:30 hours. My working hours are:

07/03/23, 20:45 - Aditi Kapoor: _Happy Monday my proud edoofian_!
How are you?

As part of your Saturday submission, I want you to answer the following questions in detail:

1. What are the key factors that have contributed to the success of NetFlorist, and how have the Bacher brothers' vision and dedication enabled them to build South Africa's largest online gifting company?
2. Additionally, what skills would you like to master in order to be successful in your professional journey?

In today's session, we will discuss:
1) Weekend activity
2) Projects
07/03/23, 20:46 - Aditi Kapoor: You know the opinions of both the question will completely differ with students but one thing that is common is that they strive to move ahead in life and take this motivation to next level. I have heard one quote on it, let me share it with you:
''One of the best ways to achieve career success is to keep assessing your performance. Don't wait for your annual appraisal – do it yourself. An ideal way to do this would be to identify quantifiable goals and set a timeline for achieving them. Start with setting short-term goals when you're new to a job.''

Your response just reflects how passionate you are towards your journey in the EWYL Program with me.
07/03/23, 22:18 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1015: 1.The company's focus on innovation and technology have contributed to the success of NetFlorist and the Bacher brothers's vision and dedication to their business have enabled them to build South Africa's largest online gifting company by giving them power to continue focusing on innovation and determination

2.l would like to master excellent communication skills, listening and speaking;adaptability skills;critical thinking, problem solving and creativity skills;initiave and drive ,teamwork skills, prioritizing my work inorder to be successful in my professional journey
07/03/23, 22:32 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, I read your response above and I shared my views on it as well.
07/03/23, 22:33 - Aditi Kapoor: Let's move our discussion on the community building project
07/03/23, 22:33 - Aditi Kapoor: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
07/03/23, 22:34 - Aditi Kapoor: A] Through WhatsApp community groups:


STEP 1: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME\/MENTOR NAME\/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED
For eg: In your case it will be Ireen\/Saloni\/7MAR2023
07/03/23, 22:34 - Aditi Kapoor: STEP 2: We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
07/03/23, 22:34 - Aditi Kapoor: As for attracting the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 5, and Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).


Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
07/03/23, 22:34 - Aditi Kapoor: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to STUDY IN INDIA with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

And in a very similar manner, you can repeat the same process with the Form 5 students as well.
07/03/23, 23:43 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1015: Will the student name be my name or the name of the applicant
08/03/23, 00:35 - Aditi Kapoor: Sorry, I did not get you.
08/03/23, 00:35 - Aditi Kapoor: We will connect on Friday from 11:30 AM-02:30 PM for our session since the organization is observing a holiday tomorrow on the eve of the Indian religious festival named HOLI.
Holi also known as the Festival of Colours, Festival of Spring, and Festival of Love, is one of the most popular and significant festivals in Hinduism. It celebrates the eternal and divine love of the gods Radha and Krishna.
08/03/23, 00:51 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1015: l mean is it my name l'm supposed to write where it is written student's name
08/03/23, 04:03 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1015: okay then,,, have a nice and wonderful holiday
08/03/23, 17:37 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1015: I am a proud Edoofian

07/06/23, 17:55 - Saloni Rastogi: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about

Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
07/06/23, 17:56 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe.
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

23/06/23, 17:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Edoofian,
We hope this message finds you well in your academic pursuits. We are excited to share a Saturday activity centered around learning from influential personalities. Our chosen figure is Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of Liberia and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Through her remarkable leadership and unwavering determination, she has left an indelible mark on history. Let's draw valuable lessons from her life for our personal development.

Two traits that stand out about Ellen Johnson Sirleaf are resilience and visionary leadership. These qualities can greatly contribute to our growth and development as individuals. They can positively impact our academic pursuits, relationships, and future career goals.

To develop resilience, we can learn from Sirleaf's ability to bounce back from challenges. We can seek out difficult experiences and learn from them, cultivating a mindset of perseverance and adaptability.

Here are some suggestions to help you get started:

Identify two traits: Reflect on Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's qualities that resonate with you.

Reflect on personal development: Consider how these traits can positively impact your academic pursuits, relationships, or future career goals.

Create an action plan: Outline practical steps like seeking mentorship, practicing self-discipline, engaging in community service, or pursuing relevant courses and extracurricular activities.
Let's embark on this exciting journey together and make Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's legacy an integral part of our own lives.
Best regards,

Team Edoofa

Honest and integrity are essential attributes for a leader as they bring fought trust and foster a culture of fairness and also we must advocate for equal opportunities and create and inclusive society that celebrates diversity. Education is also something which should be valued and we must seize opportunities for growth and work towards empowering ourselves and our communities and ability to collaborate and create diplomacy can help achieve shared goals hence promoting peace and stability. We must not also forget the importance of preserving our planet and strive to be responsible stewards of the environment contributing to a sustanaible future. We must also embrace our ability to effect change no matter our ages or background and live to aspire a positive and lasting legacy in our communities.

28/06/23, 16:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

01/07/23, 15:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!
