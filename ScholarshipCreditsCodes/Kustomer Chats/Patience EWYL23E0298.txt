29/12/23, 16:00 - Aditi Kapoor: Happy Friday!üå∫

Hope you are well.
So are you pumped up for today's session?üéØ
29/12/23, 19:03 - Aditi Kapoor: I've noticed that you've been leaving my messages on "Seen" without responding.
Your responsibility as a mentee includes actively engaging in conversations, seeking guidance when needed, and keeping me updated on your progress. Ignoring messages, even unintentionally, can hinder our ability to work together effectively and achieve your goals.

If you're facing challenges or have any concerns, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Our communication should be a two-way street, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.

 
May I know the reason for you not coming to the session?
29/12/23, 19:03 - Aditi Kapoor: As we embark on a new year, it's the perfect time to reflect on our aspirations and set goals for personal and academic growth. To kick off our Saturday activity, we invite you to share the goals you've set for yourself in the upcoming year, 2024.üéØ

Whether your goals are related to academics, personal development, extracurricular activities, or any other aspect of your life, we want to hear about them! This is a wonderful opportunity for us to inspire and support one another as a community.

Please take a moment to jot down your goals and be prepared to share them during our Saturday activity. It could be something as simple as improving your study habits, achieving a certain grade, learning a new skill, or even fostering better connections with your peers.‚ú®

Remember, setting goals is not only a way to envision your future but also a roadmap to success. By sharing your goals, you might inspire someone else to reach for their dreams as well.

Let's make 2024 a year of growth, achievement, and mutual support. We look forward to hearing about your aspirations during our Saturday activity.ü§ù

Best regards,
Team EWYL
