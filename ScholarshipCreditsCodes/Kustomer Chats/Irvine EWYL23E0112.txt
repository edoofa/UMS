Hope you are doing well, I would like to announce that today is a holiday on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan which is an auspicious Indian Festival so I am sharing the lesson with you today!

So for this week's Wednesday lesson,  I have an exciting topic to delve into: Hidden Talent.
We'll dive into the captivating story of Samuel, a character whose seemingly ordinary life takes a fascinating turn when his secret talent comes to light. Through his story, we'll discover the power of talents that lie beneath the surface, waiting for the perfect moment to shine.
So, bring your curiosity and imagination as we delve into Samuel's tale and discuss the significance of hidden talents in our own lives. You might even find yourself reflecting on your own unique abilities that are yet to be revealed.

In our upcoming session I would like to know if you have a hidden talent that you're particularly good at or passionate about? It could be anything – from artistic pursuits to something more unexpected.

Get ready to be inspired, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together!

We hope this message finds you well and thriving in your academic journey. Today, we want to encourage you to step out of your comfort zone and share your hidden talents. Whether you're a budding poet, a passionate musician, a mesmerizing dancer, a gifted painter, or possess any unique skill, it's time to embrace your talent and showcase it with unwavering confidence.

We believe that each one of you possesses a hidden gem within, waiting to be discovered. Your talents are not just hobbies; they are an integral part of who you are. They make you unique and add vibrancy to our academic community.

Why a video, you ask? Well, videos are a powerful medium to convey emotions and connect with others. They allow you to express yourself fully, capturing the essence of your talent. So, poets, we want to see you recite your verses with passion, musicians, let your melodies shine, dancers, grace the screen with your moves, and artists, unveil your creative masterpieces.

Remember, your talent is a gift that deserves to be celebrated and shared. By showcasing your hidden talents, you not only inspire others but also gain the confidence to pursue your passions further. You are required to submit your videos before our next session.

10/07/23, 17:33 - Irvine EWYL23E0112: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Vinscent Irvine Chipanga and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Irvine23E0112.
10/07/23, 19:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Irvine!
How are you?
10/07/23, 19:28 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
10/07/23, 19:28 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
10/07/23, 19:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *09:30-11:00 AM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
10/07/23, 19:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
10/07/23, 19:50 - Irvine EWYL23E0112: I am good Ms Saloni, How about you.
10/07/23, 19:52 - Irvine EWYL23E0112: I am ready Ms Saloni.

How are you?

Please follow the daily ritual for today of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'.
11/07/23, 13:30 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
