04/01/23, 23:53 - Jasmine Kaur: *Wednesday Lesson | 4 Jan*

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy learning.

Edoofian, Punctuality in school life builds the path to success in a student's life by enabling them to plan ahead, make an efficient routine, and be prepared for their tasks.

Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals towards achieving this goal. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

I would appreciate you sharing your learnings from today’s lesson.
