19/12/23, 12:50 - Brooklyn EWYL22E1062: Intergrity and Diligence

Honesty,morality,virtue,freedom,the fortitude to resist corruption and the ability to make tje right decision all describe inergrity.Every stage of life has an intergrity exam that we all should be able to pass.In education a pupil with strong moral principles won't lie or disappoint others.In business reputation is vital to success .Acting with intergrity,helps to build reputation.Likewise doing things that lack intergrity can spell your quick demise.Traits such as expression gratitude for others,helping those in need without sacrificing your own health,demonstrating reliability and trustworthiness ,respecting others and people around you no matter where you go and taking responsibility and accontability for your actions either good or bad are all housed by intergrity.Intergrity even at work is about even more than honesty and respect. If an organisation has true culture of intergrity,that means employees take their commitments crucially and are proactive when they don't understand  their responsibilities and are ultimately accountable for their results.As a result a business thrives.In life their resources such as luxury cars and good houses but without integrity such things are its clear that the resources are are or were achieved with dirty hands.At schools teachers cooperate with students with intergrity and even sacrifice for them to rip good morals and sow fascinating results.Also in life diligence is another important factor. Perseverance ,determination and long term effort  lead to a good life.Living life the hard way with diligence  leads to an easy future but living the life which is easy without diligencelead to a hard future .In life its not all about intelligence but hard work produces results.Its better to die trying to achieve greater things than to live with smaller dreams.A tree that is hit on the same position will fall faster than a tree hit at different  position. Diligence provides focus ,the ability to ne tenacious  and achieve colossal things in life.In education,businesses,cooperatives diligence is a common feature which must pravail

19/12/23, 18:08 - Aditi Kapoor: Your reflection on integrity and diligence resonates deeply with the essence of a purposeful and successful life. Integrity, as you beautifully describe, encompasses a spectrum of virtues, from honesty and morality to freedom and the courage to resist corruption. It's heartening to read about the importance of integrity at every stage of life, emphasizing the idea that each of us faces an integrity exam that we must pass.
Your insights into education highlight the significance of strong moral principles for pupils, fostering an environment of trust and reliability. In the business world, integrity becomes the bedrock of success, shaping reputations and contributing to the longevity of endeavors. The contrast you draw between acting with integrity and engaging in activities lacking integrity underscores the profound impact these choices can have on one's journey. Your thoughtful reflection serves as a compass guiding individuals toward a life rich in purpose, moral values, and hard work. The intertwining of integrity and diligence creates a roadmap for personal and collective success, reminding us that these principles are not just ideals but essential features that must prevail in our educational, professional, and communal landscapes.

21/12/23, 13:06 - Brooklyn EWYL22E1062: Thank you
21/12/23, 13:06 - Brooklyn EWYL22E1062: Yes we can start
21/12/23, 13:16 - Brooklyn EWYL22E1062: I went through the previous link you sent me which was about leadership.That was a very crucial lesson which  taught a lot.l learnt about the relationship between a leader and a follower which is at times mutualistic.A leader has to have positive persuasive skills to the follower.That was my undersating on the webinar that was carried
21/12/23, 13:31 - Aditi Kapoor: I'm delighted to hear that you found the leadership lesson valuable! Understanding the mutualistic relationship between a leader and a follower, along with the importance of positive persuasive skills, is indeed crucial in effective leadership.

21/12/23, 13:31 - Aditi Kapoor: Sure so how do you feel about our special Christmas Wednesday lesson? Let's hear your thoughts! üéÑüåü
21/12/23, 13:41 - Brooklyn EWYL22E1062: Oky that was a good lesson also,because most people do celebrate Christmas but are not aware of what Christmas really is.It is a moment of forgetting all sorts of sorrows and embrace each other with massive love,compassion and philanthropy which binds people together and transferring joy and laughter with those around us.What is done with love thrives forever and must not only be practised during holiday season but every day and its a fact
21/12/23, 13:46 - Aditi Kapoor: Indeed! I absolutely agree with your understanding ‚ù§Ô∏è
21/12/23, 13:48 - Brooklyn EWYL22E1062: That's wonderful...thank youü•∞
21/12/23, 13:48 - Aditi Kapoor: What's the one special thing you're hoping to unwrap under the Christmas tree this year? üéÑ‚ú®
21/12/23, 13:51 - Brooklyn EWYL22E1062: Oh l like the question ,but at the moment l am not aware but l am sure that l will do something amazing
21/12/23, 13:59 - Aditi Kapoor: This is amazing, I like your confidence and will.
21/12/23, 14:01 - Brooklyn EWYL22E1062: Sure,confidence is a an important attitude removes fear
21/12/23, 14:06 - Aditi Kapoor: Indeed!
21/12/23, 14:06 - Aditi Kapoor: So may I have an update on your progress's projects please.
21/12/23, 14:13 - Brooklyn EWYL22E1062: Oky  l was waiting for your assistance that..on the other project there are two senior schools where l stay and the fees is below $70.So should l connect with the principals of those schools or not
21/12/23, 14:15 - Aditi Kapoor: I mean honestly I would like you to move forward with schools above $100 fees as usually it actually presses lots of pressure on the parents who cannot afford but with their child to study in India.
21/12/23, 14:17 - Brooklyn EWYL22E1062: Oky l will keep looking for schools that are better just that our economy is low so most paprents end up sending schools at the cheapest schools..l will look for better schools
21/12/23, 14:21 - Aditi Kapoor: I understand that but let me tell you there are a a lot of schools out there with more than $100 fees.
21/12/23, 14:22 - Brooklyn EWYL22E1062: That is true ,but they are boarding schools in my locality there are no boarding schools
21/12/23, 14:24 - Aditi Kapoor: Can you elaborate on this Brooklyn?
21/12/23, 14:27 - Brooklyn EWYL22E1062: Oky l am saying where l stay there are no boarding  schools just day schools,which pay a little fees so l am now going to look for schools that are not of my local area which pay more than $100
21/12/23, 14:32 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, noted.
21/12/23, 14:33 - Aditi Kapoor: All the best!
21/12/23, 14:33 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes! may I know how many students you are currently in touch with regarding the community building project?
21/12/23, 14:34 - Brooklyn EWYL22E1062: Thank you.l will put effort on finding best schools
21/12/23, 14:34 - Aditi Kapoor: Great!
21/12/23, 14:38 - Brooklyn EWYL22E1062: Oky ,l am in contact with 7 students some of them my friends..So l am waiting to see how serous  they are and how prepared they are parents are financially then l create a group of people who are serious about it.
21/12/23, 14:42 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, but I feel that you should create a group today itself, okay?
21/12/23, 14:42 - Aditi Kapoor: So now we are wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.ü´∂üèª
