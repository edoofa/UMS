07/03/23, 01:22 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

In our Wednesday wisdom, we learned that the success story of NetFlorist highlights the significant role that innovation, customer-centricity, and hard work play in building a thriving business. The vision and dedication of the Bacher brothers have been instrumental in creating South Africa's largest online gifting company, and their commitment to innovation and customer service will likely drive NetFlorist's growth for years to come.

As part of your Saturday submission, I want you to answer the following questions in detail:

1. What are the key factors that have contributed to the success of NetFlorist, and how have the Bacher brothers' vision and dedication enabled them to build South Africa's largest online gifting company?

07/03/23, 22:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Alright, I have noted your answer, the correct answer will be revealed shortly.","transform":"
07/03/23, 22:29 - Saloni Rastogi: The correct answer for today's trivia was option  B","transform":"
07/03/23, 22:29 - Ireen EWYL22E1148: Alright
07/03/23, 22:29 - Ireen EWYL22E1148: Okay
07/03/23, 22:30 - Saloni Rastogi: On Community Building,  Now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
07/03/23, 22:31 - Saloni Rastogi: A] Through WhatsApp community groups:


STEP 1: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME\/MENTOR NAME\/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED
For eg: In your case it will be Ireen\/Saloni\/7MAR2023
07/03/23, 22:31 - Ireen EWYL22E1148: Waiting
07/03/23, 22:31 - Saloni Rastogi: STEP 2: We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
07/03/23, 22:31 - Saloni Rastogi: As for attracting the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 5, and Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).


Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
07/03/23, 22:32 - Saloni Rastogi: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to STUDY IN INDIA with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

And in a very similar manner, you can repeat the same process with the Form 5 students as well.
07/03/23, 22:32 - Saloni Rastogi: Did you receive the step 1 idea Ireen?
07/03/23, 22:33 - Ireen EWYL22E1148: Yes l did ma'am
07/03/23, 22:54 - Ireen EWYL22E1148: I'm now going back to my studies,have a great day ahead
07/03/23, 23:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Did you add me in the group Ireen?
08/03/23, 00:53 - Ireen EWYL22E1148: I haven't created the group yet but l will surely add you as l create the group today
08/03/23, 16:04 - Ireen EWYL22E1148: I have added you
