30/05/23, 15:47 - Ananya: So, were you able to read the newsletter?
30/05/23, 15:50 - Beckham EWYL22E1058: Yes I did go through it
30/05/23, 15:56 - Ananya: So, would you like to share your views on it?
30/05/23, 15:59 - Beckham EWYL22E1058: 1. From my own understanding, we can overcome anxiety by preparing and eliminating the negative thoughts in our minds. I am struggling with it but I believe if I continue fighting it someday I will be successful.

2. The best way to help a person with anxiety is to positively affirm them and tell them that they are doing great. This usually will help them calm their nerves.
30/05/23, 15:59 - Ananya: Have you tried calming down your nerves?
30/05/23, 16:03 - Beckham EWYL22E1058: Yes. Usually the method I use is the breath in breath out though sometimes it may take a long time to calm down
30/05/23, 16:05 - Ananya: That is great, so you are experienced , right?
30/05/23, 16:14 - Beckham EWYL22E1058: Yes here and there but what I can say is that most of the times, my anxiety is due to lack of preparation.
30/05/23, 16:15 - Ananya: what kind of preparation?
30/05/23, 16:26 - Beckham EWYL22E1058: Preparation as in rehearsal. For example sometimes when I am giving a speech that I did not prepare for. I get nervous before the event
30/05/23, 16:32 - Ananya: It's completely normal to feel nervous when faced with an unprepared situation, like giving a speech. However, I want to remind you that preparation is key to boosting your confidence and delivering a successful performance. By dedicating time to rehearsing and practicing your speech beforehand, you can significantly reduce anxiety and improve your overall performance. Remember, every moment spent preparing is an investment in your success. So embrace the opportunity to prepare and watch your confidence soar as you conquer any challenge that comes your way.
30/05/23, 16:39 - Beckham EWYL22E1058: Yes, that is true. Being prepared can help gain confidence
30/05/23, 16:46 - Ananya: Great, now may I ask if you were able to search for schools?
30/05/23, 16:49 - Beckham EWYL22E1058: Yes, I did search for some schools but I could not get some information on Linkedln as I did not have enough connections to access some information on the workers of the school
30/05/23, 16:49 - Ananya: Beckham, so why aren't you expanding your network?
30/05/23, 16:57 - Beckham EWYL22E1058: I have been expanding it. Now I have 143 connections
