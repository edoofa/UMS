14/12/23, 16:21 - Violet EWYL23E0937: I really can't wait to have a opportunity to learn skills that are going to help me build my social skills and self confidence because have such an opportunity means having an opportunity to create your own market
14/12/23, 16:22 - Aditi Kapoor: That's great!
14/12/23, 16:23 - Violet EWYL23E0937: Thank you
14/12/23, 16:24 - Aditi Kapoor: So may I know if you have created the group for community building?
14/12/23, 16:26 - Violet EWYL23E0937: Am still trying to find people who are interested in being part of the Edoofa community but as most of them are waiting for their results
14/12/23, 16:26 - Violet EWYL23E0937: It's a bit of a challenge there
14/12/23, 16:33 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, tell them they can also apply before their results are out as till that time they can start their counseling sessions, right?
14/12/23, 16:33 - Violet EWYL23E0937: Alright no problem
14/12/23, 16:34 - Violet EWYL23E0937: I will do as wise
14/12/23, 16:44 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, great!
And what about the school's project?
14/12/23, 16:45 - Violet EWYL23E0937: The school head management hasn't been responding to me so I don't know what to do if I should continue or not
14/12/23, 16:47 - Violet EWYL23E0937: As for the other school project I did visit two secondary schools and they did say I will be called next week so that I can discuss with them more about Edoofa
14/12/23, 16:49 - Aditi Kapoor: Violet, may I know why didn't you share the message that I sent you when we were discussing the School's project.
14/12/23, 16:50 - Violet EWYL23E0937: I only sent her that to let her know who was texting her because  it would have been better for her to know who I am before proceeding with the message you sent me
14/12/23, 16:59 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, I understand.
14/12/23, 17:00 - Violet EWYL23E0937: Exactly

Elevate your skills and broaden your horizons with Edoofa's commitment to education for all
18/12/23, 16:00 - Aditi Kapoor: Your storytelling prowess shines through in this captivating narrative centered around Nhamoinesu, the street kid. It's a tale that transcends the ordinary and delves into the extraordinary facets of resilience, determination, and the transformative power of honesty and hard work.
Nhamo's character is a beacon of inspiration, navigating the harsh realities of street life with a spirit that refuses to be broken. The discovery of the map adds an intriguing twist, and Nhamo's pursuit of treasure becomes a metaphor for the universal quest for a meaningful and fulfilling life.
The symbolism in Nhamo's journey is profound‚Äîthe treasure turning out to be friendship, love, and a sense of belonging echoes the profound truth that life's richest treasures often lie in human connections and shared experiences. It's a powerful reminder that material wealth pales in comparison to the wealth of the heart. Nhamo's legacy as a symbol of integrity is a timeless lesson that resonates with the reader. It serves as a testament to the idea that no matter our circumstances, the virtues of honesty, integrity, and diligence can guide us toward a brighter future.
This narrative is not just a story; it's a parable that imparts wisdom and offers a perspective on life's journey. Well done! I look forward to more stories that weave together lessons and inspiration in such a compelling manner.
18/12/23, 16:00 - Aditi Kapoor: Good Afternoon on this wonderful day‚òÉÔ∏è
