20/07/22, 01:34 - Unknown: Hello nigel! How are you doing my proud Edoofian?
20/07/22, 01:34 - Unknown: nigel,Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"
20/07/22, 01:34 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
20/07/22, 01:34 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
20/07/22, 05:11 - Nigel EWYL22E0312: That  is so amazing
Thank you sir for such strong wonderful message to me.
l'm now feeling different to other students and great because of this big opportunity of mine
20/07/22, 20:49 - Unknown: Hello Edoofian! How are you?

Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.

\"Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.\" ~ Bruce Lee

In this week's Wednesday lesson, you learned about the different sorts of personalities a person carries, but only a true leader is one who understands their personality and can do wonders with its power. In today's activity, I want you to dig deeper into your own consciousness and learn more about the kind of personality you are. As I believe, the more you know yourself, the clearer your vision of the world and your mind gets. Below is a link to a personality test, which you shall be taking up this week, and then would be sharing the results via a screenshot to your mentors by Monday. You can then read and understand more about your results by discussing them with your Mentor.

This particular exercise is going to give you an insight into the kind of person you are so that you can use your strengths to yield the maximum benefits in whatever work you take up.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own personality while performing this activity.

Have a wonderful weekend ahead.

Deadline -  Monday.

Another insightful Wednesday Wisdom is presented here. The lesson today teaches us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, disability. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition. A few questions near the end of the session will ask you to reflect and have an open dialogue with yourself. After you finish your lesson, as your mentor, I'd like to have a thorough conversation about your key takeaways, in our upcoming sessions.

Enjoy the article and keep in mind that success does not come to you suddenly; rather, it can be attained over time by making modest, daily improvements.

Happy learning!
17/11/22, 00:56 - Unknown: Nigel, let's connect tomorrow morning to discuss about the issues you have addressed.
17/11/22, 01:00 - Nigel EWYL22E0312: Ok fine
17/11/22, 01:01 - Unknown: Till then, if you have any other issues as well. You can tell me about them, so that I can address those as well to the board.
17/11/22, 01:03 - Nigel EWYL22E0312: Fact ??
17/11/22, 01:04 - Unknown: What?
17/11/22, 01:05 - Nigel EWYL22E0312: l mean its alright
17/11/22, 01:15 - Unknown: Great! Although, on the point that you are being served only eggs. I would like to emphasize by saying that it is really lucky for you to be able to get even eggs in the university mess. As you know, India is a Hindu country, and in its traditions and culture. Non-veg is strictly prohibited. In some homes, you cannot even bring it inside a house. In a similar way, since Indians consider schools and colleges as a place of worship, it is the temple of education. Hence, it is strictly prohibited to run any non-veg kitchen on the campuses. But even then universities are trying to provide it to you. Secondly, meat or protein is something which you can have an alternative for, or order it from outside or eat it from some different place. So, I guess it shall be a majority call, and since most of the students are vegetarians, they even tend to stay away from eating from any kitchen where non-veg is prepared. So, I don't think it would be possible for the university to make that call. Apart from that, regarding the hygiene issues, you would be notified of the call to action tomorrow and can follow it.

At last Nigel! I would again want to reiterate something, I told you on the very first day! Life is all about adjustments because it won't stop for anyone, if you wish to keep moving ahead, you have to mend your ways, and always focus on the bigger picture. I hope you are with me on this point.
17/11/22, 01:28 - Nigel EWYL22E0312: Ok l think the best is all Africans to stay outside so that we can prepare our on meals
