14/07/22, 22:38 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Tadiwanashe!
How's your day going?
14/07/22, 22:38 - Unknown: From his dad’s small foray into entrepreneurship, Patrice Motsepe got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe’s success story is a remarkable one showing how curiosity, doggedness, perseverance, and the knack to exploit great opportunities as they come, can determine how successful or not, any individual could become. 
And this was all about our WEDNESDAY WISDOM.
Hope you have gone through it.
I am so excited to listen to your thoughts and views here.
14/07/22, 23:48 - Tadiwanashe EWYL21E0451: Yes I was really inspired with the way he started it started as a small thing but ended up big this just gave me a view that we can even start right now with what we have and we upgrade but we need the skills for running businesses in us and we use our degree sometimes to boost our ideas up
15/07/22, 02:59 - Unknown: I read your response Tadiwanashe and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a way. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. With can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.

The relevant local authorities have powers to designate the design and carrying out of building works in their jurisdictions.''

22/07/22, 17:46 - Unknown: I am doing absolutely fine, thanks for asking.
22/07/22, 17:47 - Unknown: I read your response Tadiwanashe and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.

25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Change your mindset, change your life. It sounds so easy, yet many of us tell ourselves it’s too late to change careers or that we don’t have enough time to learn something new. Living with these limiting beliefs creates a self-fulfilling prophecy: we believe we can’t, so we don’t. If we instead lived in terms of “I can” and “I will”, imagine what we could achieve!

I believe our thoughts have incredible power over our everyday lives, and that our moods and behaviors are a reflection of how we think. Over the years, I’ve developed 7 hacks to ensure I’m always in the right frame of mind to be successful and happy — and it starts with imagining possibilities instead of focusing on roadblocks.



Ask people to imagine the impossible and you’ll be surprised what you can achieve.

Anyone can transform their mindset and learn to ask “Can You Imagine?” too. Here are the 7 mindsets of highly successful (and happy) people.

1. Ditch the Fixed Mindset and Go For Growth



Let’s say you feel like you’re not getting ahead at work. A fixed mindset says the situation is the way it is, and it will never change no matter what you do. A growth mindset says you can create change if you work hard, adapt to feedback and implement strategies for pe

26/07/22, 17:33 - Tadiwanashe EWYL21E0451: Growing mindsets of successful people is stopping fearing failure.It produces a mindset that has no shame in failure a mindset that accept failing as part of learning a mindset that is not set to quit at anything.Also having a mindset that plan it's long term goals and short term goals helps because you can never reach where you are going if you don't know the name of your destination.Praying also grows your mindset in success the Bible say in the book of Proverbs 1:7 the fear of The Lord is beginning of all wisdom you cannot get any wisdom unless you go to your creator.Being solution giver build our mindsets in the field of success because the world needs solutions if we only educate ourselves to be employed we won't meet our requirements in this world.
26/07/22, 19:12 - Unknown: I read your understanding of the activity Tadiwanashe and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it’s not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you’re looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don’t do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.

How's your day going?
28/07/22, 23:04 - Unknown: ime management is defined as using your time productively and efficiently—but what about when you are working as productively as possible, and you still can’t get everything done? It may be better to think about time management as a combination of working productively and prioritizing your time.

Our *Wednesday Wisdom* was all about Time Management and understanding the priority matrix to organize our tasks. 
I am really excited to hear your understanding and working on the same.
Please share it with me here.
In today's session we will talk about:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. progress on community building projects.
29/07/22, 08:08 - Tadiwanashe EWYL21E0451: Time management is one of the biggest thing inorder to achieve success.When people work with time they become organised and it is something that changes the way you think and also the way you see things.Managing time is good because you won't procrastinate since everything will be planned wisely.Being good at managing time also makes one disciplined in whatever you do

29/07/22, 21:47 - Unknown: Good afternoon Tadiwanashe!
How's your day going?
29/07/22, 21:48 - Unknown: Your response to the Wednesday wisdom has made me realize our childhood quote  is Money'.
Through Wednesday Wisdom, my main aim was to educate my Edoofians about TIME MANAGEMENT and HOW IT CAN BE ACHIEVED.
You know are very well aware of what Time management means, let me tell you about what Time Management includes:

#Effective Planning
# Setting goals and objectives
# Setting deadlines
# Delegation of responsibilities
# Prioritizing activities as per their importance
# Spending the right time on the right activity

The benefits of Time Management are:
- Time Management makes an individual punctual and disciplined.
- One becomes more organized as a result of effective Time Management.
- Individuals who stick to a time plan are the ones who realize their goals and objectives within the shortest possible period. 
- Research says that individuals who accomplish tasks on time are less prone to stress and anxiety. 

How can we achieve it:
# Set a goal for yourself.
# Priority matrix (like we talked about in the Wednesday lesson)
# Organize your study space
# Do a SWOT Analysis of yourself.

I am sure you will note all these things and imply in your day-to-day life and do share with me what changes you have felt.
29/07/22, 21:50 - Unknown: I am so happy to receive these forms from you Tadiwanashe.
I just want to ask one thing from you  do you know these students from whom you have got these forms filled, may I please know that?
30/07/22, 04:40 - Tadiwanashe EWYL21E0451: Yes I know these people former schoolm
30/07/22, 04:41 - Tadiwanashe EWYL21E0451: *schoolmates
30/07/22, 04:41 - Tadiwanashe EWYL21E0451: From the same school with me
30/07/22, 04:41 - Tadiwanashe EWYL21E0451: They're all my friends
31/07/22, 21:34 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. \r
﻿\r
So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!\r
﻿\r
Happy Weekend!\r

01/08/22, 17:56 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
01/08/22, 23:06 - Unknown: A timetable is a framework that lets individuals see specific activities lined up. In this framework, it shows the tie allotment among several tasks and courses. It ensures equal distribution of time among activities and subjects, creates a smooth workflow, prevents wasting of time and efforts, and aids in creating good habits.
The *weekend activity* asked you to draw a timetable for yourself and of course, have time for your scheduled sessions as well.
I am really excited to see your timetable on the EWYL Line and of course, we can discuss how we can manage our sessions accordingly.
In this session today, we will discuss:
1. your timetable (as a part of the weekend activity)
2. progress on community building projects
01/08/22, 23:06 - Unknown: I am sharing a format with you, please construct a timetable and share it with me here.
