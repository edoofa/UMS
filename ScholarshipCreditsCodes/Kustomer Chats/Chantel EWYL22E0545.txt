06/11/23, 22:54 - Chantel EWYL22E0545: Good Evening maam, I'm  glad to be sharing with you my dreams ,visions and aspirations  as well as insights as a vibrant young woman  .
To commence with, it is with my personality to believe  that hard work  can help to accomplish  anything ,as the systematic work only bears  the fruit if you select only an appropriate route.It is my dream  to study law ,my ambition to become  an international  corporate/ commercial lawyer and my vision to expand and expagorate my horizons as woman inorder to be successful .Though I have faced problems  and have past experiences of some close and distant  relatives or associates' negative  perceptions  towards life, I have come to a conclusion that despite what people might say about  my life be it positive  or negative, I should  always  choose  the positive because  I believe  I'm a gifted  human being with intelligence ,prodigy and dignity.For one speaker once said, "the real loser is not the one who croses the finish line last, but it is the one who does not even try to compete and sit on the sidelines".I believe hard work is wonderful  and has many opportunities.For me , being a lawyer is not just  a desired profession intended only  for benefits ,but it my dream and vision to be able to promote socio- economic justice and fairness inorder to save the world through universalizing peace and stability for all 
People  across the world.Thus , my insights as words of inspiration  would be "Never let hardships and failure  disturb you , no one can avoid problems, not even saints or sages.The obstacles  of your past can become gateways  and bridges that lead to new beginnings ,if you can make a balance  between  expectations  and reality. "
07/11/23, 13:44 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings!
Hope you are well.

Thank you for sharing your dreams and aspirations. Your belief in hard work and choosing the right path to success is truly admirable. Your dream of studying law, ambition to become an international corporate/commercial lawyer, and vision of expanding your horizons as a successful woman are all inspiring goals.

08/11/23, 14:46 - Aditi Kapoor: Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.
08/11/23, 14:46 - Aditi Kapoor: .....

Well I learned  that diwali is a celebration  of light triumphing over darkness. And it also serves  as a way to ensure unity within families , as people  obtain  opportunities  to celebrate  together.
15/11/23, 13:55 - Aditi Kapoor: Happy Wednesday! üåü
Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
