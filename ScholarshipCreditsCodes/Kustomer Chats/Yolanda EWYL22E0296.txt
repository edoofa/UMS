15/07/22, 02:17 - Yolanda EWYL22E0296: I was inspired by Patrice's hardworking targeting his dream and his passion to see himself being successful in life.

The fact that he managed to acquire business skills and get exposure from his father's small shop inspires me and motivate me to also hard work and achieve what my heart desires

Despite being a lawyers Patrice gave himself time to study mining and being one of the blacks to be listed on the South African stock exchange.
15/07/22, 02:18 - Yolanda EWYL22E0296: Okay sir
15/07/22, 03:06 - Jasmine Kaur: Amazing work on the Lesson task. I saw that Patrice had the wisdom to recognize and grab the opportunities that time brought for him and that is what set him apart from others and made him who he is.

18/07/22, 19:18 - Jasmine Kaur: Yolanda, Did you work on the  very interesting Weekend activity? 

I personally enjoyed learning about SWOT analysis and implementing it for my self. I hope you did too.
18/07/22, 20:53 - Yolanda EWYL22E0296: Yes I did iam sorry for late submission.... Today i have a exams one after the other but um submitting
18/07/22, 23:01 - Jasmine Kaur: I see Yolanda. have you prepared well for it?
18/07/22, 23:11 - Yolanda EWYL22E0296: Yes sir i did tried my best
18/07/22, 23:14 - Jasmine Kaur: Amazing to read your response for the weekend activity. I like how you chose this particular industry and how you have explained about it's growth in the time to come. Keep it up.
18/07/22, 23:15 - Jasmine Kaur: Let me first help you understand what SWOT Analysis is.

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment.This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organisations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
18/07/22, 23:31 - Yolanda EWYL22E0296: Noted sir
19/07/22, 00:01 - Jasmine Kaur: As seen above, SWOT is an acronym of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. However, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym:

1 Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
2 Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
3 Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
4 Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by
19/07/22, 00:04 - Yolanda EWYL22E0296: Noted
19/07/22, 00:24 - Jasmine Kaur: You know why SWOT Analysis is important? It can help you to challenge risky assumptions and to uncover dangerous blindspots about your organization's performance. If you use it carefully and collaboratively, it can deliver new insights on where your business currently is, and help you to develop exactly the right strategy for any situation.
19/07/22, 00:24 - Jasmine Kaur: Yolanda,For example, you may be well aware of some of your organization's strengths, but until you record them alongside weaknesses and threats you might not realize how unreliable those strengths actually are.

Equally, you likely have reasonable concerns about some of your business weaknesses but, by going through the analysis systematically, you could find an opportunity, previously overlooked, that could more than compensate.
19/07/22, 01:42 - Jasmine Kaur: Now, What Are the Biggest SWOT Analysis Mistakes people make?
19/07/22, 02:33 - Yolanda EWYL22E0296: They usually let go of projects before analysing the opportunities it carries
19/07/22, 02:50 - Jasmine Kaur: that is good observation Yolanda.
19/07/22, 02:51 - Jasmine Kaur: In addition to this, I believe people make the following mistakes.
1 Making your lists too long. Ask yourself if your ideas are feasible as you go along.
2 Being vague. Be specific to provide more focus for later discussions.
3. Not seeing weaknesses. Be sure to ask customers and colleagues what they experience in real life.
4. Not thinking ahead. It's easy to come up with nice ideas without taking them through to their logical conclusion. Always consider their practical impact.
5 Being unrealistic. Don't plan in detail for opportunities that don't exist yet.
19/07/22, 02:54 - Yolanda EWYL22E0296: Okay sir
19/07/22, 18:17 - Yolanda EWYL22E0296: Iam a proud edoofian
