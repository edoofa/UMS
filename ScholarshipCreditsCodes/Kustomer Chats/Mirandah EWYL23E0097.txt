Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
Here we are with our weekend activity, it has been some time that we are talking about leadership, styles of leadership and have even learnt alot for our leader from Edoofa. It goes without saying that leadership is a skill that one acquires over time and with continous effort to acquire this characteristic.The EWYL programme, each project and task that is assigned to you, is a direct place for you to practise this skill. This weekend, sit with yourself and write about how you can use the EWYL programme to master the skill of leadership, and make a plan for which projects you will prioritise to be a leader in the student community. How will you ensure that your name is on the next list of student leaders for the Edoofa student community? Some of the students have already been recommended as Student Leaders by the mentors; how will you ensure that your name is on the next list of student leaders for the Edoofa student community?
Since a detailed plan is required, so the minimum word limit of today‚Äôs activity is 150 words.

The last day to submit your responses is Monday and don‚Äôt forget only the responses shared on dedicated EWYL line will be evaluated.

Transformational Leadership, Delegative Leadership, Authoritative Leadership, Transactional Leadership, Participative Leadership and Servant Leadership. 
I will engage in Transformational and Participative Leaderships.
I will try to engage the headteachers of the secondary schools in my district so that they can trickle down the edoofa program to their pupils.
The other aspect I will attempt to undertake is engage my former classmates. I will also bring on board my extended family so that they can appreciate the significance of edoofa scholarship and education. Granted, I have already extended the edoofa program to some of my colleagues and friends and they have expressed interest.
I have also requested my parents to advertise the edoofa scholarship at their places of work. And they have told me that the response is positive.

24/05/23, 18:48 - Tenzin: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian!
Hope are doing well.

‚ÄúWhen I discover who I am, I'll be free.‚Äù ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.
