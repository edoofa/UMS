27/06/23, 15:54 - Tenzin: Did I send my video?
27/06/23, 15:55 - Tapiwanashe EWYL22E0517: Yes maam
27/06/23, 15:56 - Tenzin: Okay, Tapiwanashe, today when I was on my way to the organization, I came across a motivational story on my phone and I learned a lot from it. I wish to share it with you so that you can read and learn something from the moral of the story. Would you like to know?


And please while you read it please ask if you don't understand a sentence or a word or even the whole story, I will make sure we learn something new today.
27/06/23, 15:56 - Tapiwanashe EWYL22E0517: Yeah sure

Ok ma'am
27/06/23, 15:57 - Tenzin: One morning, an elderly man was walking along the beach when he noticed a young boy picking something off the sand and throwing it into the sea.
As he got closer, the man realized the child was throwing stranded starfishes that had washed up on the shore back into the breaking waves.
Approaching the boy, the man asked what he was doing.
“The starfish will die if they’re still on the shore when the sun rises,” he replied.
Perplexed, the old man said, “But that’s pointless! There are countless miles of beach and thousands of starfish. It doesn’t matter how many you return to the water, you can’t make a difference.”
Unfazed, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish, and tossed it into the sea.
“It matters to this one,” he said.
27/06/23, 15:58 - Tapiwanashe EWYL22E0517: It's such a touching educating story
27/06/23, 15:59 - Tenzin: Moral of the story:

No matter the odds of success or the scale of the challenge, your actions can make a difference. It’s better to light a candle than curse the dark.

Every little one counts. Doing something to make a positive change is always better than nothing!
27/06/23, 16:01 - Tapiwanashe EWYL22E0517: Yeah sure thank you ma'am for the motivation
27/06/23, 16:01 - Tenzin: Shall we discuss the project now?
27/06/23, 16:01 - Tapiwanashe EWYL22E0517: Yeah sure
27/06/23, 16:04 - Tenzin: We are now gonna set targets for our projects, I do not want us to lag behind other students, There are students who have already earned more than 1200$ And I wish us to earn more than them.
27/06/23, 16:04 - Tapiwanashe EWYL22E0517: Ok so how do I start earning money
27/06/23, 16:05 - Tenzin: I would like you to send me 2 student Forms every day. And if you fail to bring me 1 form on one day then the next day you will have to bring 3 forms so that we don't miss our targets. How does that sound? so now every week we will have 14 forms okay?
And 2 school forms for the week.
But if you bring more than 14 forms that will be great.
27/06/23, 16:08 - Tapiwanashe EWYL22E0517: Ma'am can you help a bit.....student form you mean two students application forms

28/06/23, 16:52 - Tenzin: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

08/07/23, 14:24 - Tenzin: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!
08/07/23, 16:01 - Tenzin: I am so sorry, I shared the activity of last week, and I am sharing this week's now.
08/07/23, 16:02 - Tenzin: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

Its time for our Saturday Activity, I want you to delve into the realm of inspiration and write a detailed essay about a person whom you know personally and who embodies the remarkable trait of consistency. This individual has consistently demonstrated their dedication, determination, and unwavering commitment, becoming a true source of inspiration for you.

In your essay, please explore the key aspects of their life, experiences, and actions that exemplify their consistent nature. Describe how their consistent approach has positively influenced and impacted not only their own life but also the lives of those around them. Reflect on specific instances or situations where their consistent behavior or mindset has motivated you to strive for excellence or overcome challenges in your own life.

Feel free to include personal anecdotes, observations, or conversations that highlight the impact this person's consistency has had on your growth and development. Additionally, analyze the qualities, values, or strategies that you believe contribute to their ability to maintain consistency over time.

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy learning.
05/01/23, 02:39 - Tapiwanashe EWYL22E0517: Sorry sir .... My school opened yesterday so I was busy preparing for our new syllabus in our for the new season
05/01/23, 02:44 - Tapiwanashe EWYL22E0517: Sorry sir .... My school opened yesterday so I was busy preparing for our new syllabus in our for the new season
05/01/23, 03:03 - Tapiwanashe EWYL22E0517: I will sir for now I am busy with assignments
05/01/23, 22:17 - Unknown: Greetings, Tapiwanashe
I hope that you are doing well
05/01/23, 22:17 - Unknown: We would have to discuss this challenge in detail and find out a solution for this, Tapiwanashe
06/01/23, 00:04 - Unknown: Edoofian, I hope that you are aware that I interact with hundreds of students in a single day.
It is my duty that each conversation that I have should be fruitful. To make sure this happens, I have allotted different time slots to each student.

But if a student is not active during this time slot, then this defeats the whole purpose.
Next time, Please make sure that you realise the importance of timeslots and free yourself up for a fruitful session because this is the only way through which we can earn credits.

We will have an additional session at the same time tomorrow.
For that, Please make sure that YOU reach out to me 5 mins prior to our session timings.
Have a cheerful day ahead

06/01/23, 23:03 - Tapiwanashe EWYL22E0517: Firstly for today lesson I was not aware of the timings.

Secondly.... Sir this is my final year I am writing my upper 6 final examination....bad news about it our school changed all the teachers who used to teach us....the new teachers we have are refusing to cover up some other topics left behind... So my complaint is I am not available to your sessions most of the time because of the pressure to cover up these topics so as to quickly finish my syllabus for me to have time for revision.

I don't know maybe they miss interpreted or I didn't get it right but my first mentor said I will be starting earn while you learn program as soon after I finish writing the final exams.

For now sir I would plead you to understand me it's not that I am lazy but I am trying to score both sides the pressure is too much for now

I am sorry sir

13/01/23, 07:29 - Tapiwanashe EWYL22E0517: I am proud to be an Edoofian
13/01/23, 07:30 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

16/01/23, 22:11 - Unknown: Edoofian, There is some important work due to which I won't be able to connect for our session.
In order to cover up for our missed session, We will connect tomorrow at the same time.
Please make sure that YOU reach out to me 5 mins prior to our session timings in order to start it.
I am sharing some messages with you below, Please have a look at them.
The first one is the Saturday Activity and the second is the new Student Application Form that you have to use from now on for the Community Building Project.
Have a cheerful day ahead!
16/01/23, 22:12 - Unknown: The ability to solve problems is a basic life skill and is essential to our day-to-day lives, at home, at school, and at work. We solve problems every day without really thinking about how we solve them. For example: it’s raining and you need to go to the store. What do you do? There are lots of possible solutions. Take your umbrella and walk. If you don't want to get wet, you can drive, or take the bus. There is no right way to solve this problem and different people will solve it differently. However in our Wednesday wisdom we learnt about some Problem solving strategies. As part of your Saturday activity, I want you to share with us a problem that you encountered very recently and how did you Solve It. Did you use any strategy that was similar to what Munger has talked about?

Looking forward to your responses!
