North Star Metric is a key business metric that reflects the core value a product delivers to its customers. It's a single, actionable metric that aligns all efforts towards achieving long-term growth. Let us learn about in greater detail, read the lesson carefully and we will connect in our upcoming scheduled session.

12/03/23, 18:11 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well

The feedback we have received from some of you on this week‚Äôs Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.
As part of this week‚Äôs Saturday Activity, you are required to share your written submission on : 
What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?
There is no word limit, so feel free to express your understanding in detail. The second answer requires some mental work, so sit with yourself, introspect, and share your honest answer with your mentor. 
Let this activity play an important role in your personal goal setting. We will connect soon in our upcoming session. 
Till then, happy learning and happy growing!

16/03/23, 11:09 - Jasmine Kaur: Here's your lesson for this week. 
I want you to come prepared with the lesson for our today's session
16/03/23, 11:09 - Jasmine Kaur: This week's Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the topic of \"Seeking Wealth, not Money or Status.\" This is an important lesson that will provide valuable insights into the pursuit of financial stability and success. During this lesson, we will explore the concept of wealth and its importance in building a sustainable financial future. We will discuss the difference between wealth, money, and status, and how each of these concepts plays a role in our lives.
I encourage you to read the lesson in detail and take notes to fully understand the material. It is important to engage with this topic and think critically about your own financial goals and aspirations.
By understanding the importance of seeking wealth over money or status, you can develop a more sustainable and fulfilling path toward financial success. I look forward to exploring this topic with you in more detail during our upcoming lesson.

Happy learning!
17/03/23, 20:10 - Patience EWYL22E0730: Seek wealth , not Money or Status


It provides a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial stability and success . Wealth is having an asset that earn while you sleep
On the other hand, money is a tool tat we use to transfer time and wealth.
Furthermore,Status is youe place in your society hierarchy .it is often associated with wealth and money but it is not a measure of time , success and happiness
17/03/23, 20:12 - Patience EWYL22E0730: In conclusion, by focusing on creating assets that generate passive income you can create a steady stream of income that can support you and your family

10/06/23, 15:48 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week‚Äôs Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better‚Äîtogether. It‚Äôs why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger‚Äîas successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!
