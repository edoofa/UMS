08/11/23, 13:01 - Unknown: Good day, Riyahboka! I'd like to kick off this session with a motivating quote by Robert Frost: "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference." As we gather here today, let's reflect on the path we've chosen, the journey we're on, and how it's shaping our lives.

08/11/23, 13:30 - Unknown: Riyahboka, while I understand that exams can be quite challenging. It's important to remember that you are not alone in feeling this way, and many students go through similar experiences during exam periods. Here are some tips to help you manage and navigate through your exams:
08/11/23, 13:31 - Unknown: Stay Organized: Create a study schedule and set clear goals for each study session. Planning your study time can help you stay on track.
Take Breaks: Don't forget to take short breaks during your study sessions. It can help you recharge and maintain your focus.
Healthy Lifestyle: Eating well, getting enough sleep, and engaging in physical activity can have a positive impact on your concentration and stress levels.
Study Smart: Focus on understanding the material rather than just memorizing it. Ask for help if you're stuck on a particular topic.
Stay Positive: Maintain a positive mindset and believe in your ability to overcome challenges. Avoid negative self-talk.
Reach Out for Support: If you're struggling with a particular subject or topic, don't hesitate to ask your teachers, mentors, or peers for assistance.
Practice Self-Care: It's essential to find time for relaxation and activities you enjoy outside of studying to relieve stress.
08/11/23, 13:31 - Unknown: Always remember, exams are a part of your educational journey, and while they can be demanding, they are also an opportunity to showcase your knowledge and skills. You've got this, and I'm here to support you. If you ever need guidance or someone to talk to about your studies, feel free to reach out.
08/11/23, 14:31 - Unknown: Now that the time is over for our scheduled session, I would like to share my observation that since you did not participate actively in the session, we could not complete our discussion on everything that I planned for.
08/11/23, 14:32 - Unknown: For our upcoming session, your goal is to connect with a minimum of 30 students and assist them.

Also, you should at least be submitting 15 student application forms.

This means actively engaging with students, offering guidance on the application process, addressing their questions and concerns, and ensuring they meet the necessary requirements and deadlines. Our objective is to help these students succeed in their applications, and I'm committed to working together with you to achieve this target.
08/11/23, 14:35 - Unknown: In conclusion, remember that every step you take, every challenge you face, and every success you achieve contributes to our collective journey. Let's continue to be a source of inspiration for each other, pushing ourselves to explore the road less traveled and make all the difference in the world. Thank you for your commitment, and I look forward to our continued collaboration and growth.
08/11/23, 16:00 - Unknown: Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

 As we witness the remarkable progress in AI, we ponder its potential to transform our lives and simultaneously question if it will replace us
15/11/23, 14:13 - Unknown: Dear Riyaboka,

Happy Wednesday! üåü Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
