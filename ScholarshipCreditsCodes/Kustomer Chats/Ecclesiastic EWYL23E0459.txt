The Great Rift Valley is like Mother Nature showing off her impressive artistic skills. Just breathtaking!
20/11/23, 13:41 - Ecclesiastic EWYL23E0459: No, thanks for sharing this amazing information
20/11/23, 13:52 - Unknown: Good morning Ecclesiastic
Thank you so much for joining the EWYL Line. You are warmly welcomed. 
I am looking forward to our session tomorrow at 9:30 am.
20/11/23, 13:53 - Unknown: In the meanwhile, I would like to share with you this week's Saturday activity.
Before our session tomorrow, kindly submit the response for the same.
20/11/23, 13:53 - Ecclesiastic EWYL23E0459: I am  fine thank you

Okay thank you
20/11/23, 13:53 - Unknown: Today's Saturday activity is a special one – it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.
As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!
For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.
By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.
Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.
Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!
Best,

Team EWYL!

29/11/23, 12:59 - Ecclesiastic EWYL23E0459: I come from a poor family. In 2018 my mother got employed at Alheit High School . She got that chance because of her level of education. In 2019 my mother took me to continue my education at Alheit. As my family was poor sometimes I used to feel out of place due to level of wealthy. My ordinary level for me was so difficult as l was without any friend to share my ideas and problems.l worked extra hard to achieve something and at the end l passed my ordinary level.  After ordinary level ,my parents failed to find me school fres to continue with my education .However the RCZ  synod committee  give me the chance to continue with my education by paying me three quarters of my school fees which reduce labour to my parents. My  wish since I was young was to do something which will improve the standard of living of my family. Now l have finished my Advanced Level ,the only thing which is left is to fulfill my dreams to be one of prestigious professionals in my society. Because of my every day living sometimes gives me extra power to work hard so that my family can also be counted in my society. The challenge which is still bothering me is the lack of money  so that l can talk to you everytime I am supposed to do so. Sometimes I also failed to talk to people because they will be laughing at me due to different levels of living. The only thing which makes me happy every single day is that my brothers and my sister are thriving very hard to help me fulfill my dreams.
