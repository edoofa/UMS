13/02/23, 22:28 - Saloni Rastogi: One morning, an elderly man was walking along the beach when he noticed a young boy picking something off the sand and throwing it into the sea.

As he got closer, the man realized the child was throwing stranded starfishes that had washed up on the shore back into the breaking waves.

Approaching the boy, the man asked what he was doing.

‚ÄúThe starfish will die if they‚Äôre still on the shore when the sun rises,‚Äù he replied.

Perplexed, the old man said, ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs pointless! There are countless miles of beach and thousands of starfish. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many you return to the water, you can‚Äôt make a difference.‚Äù

Unfazed, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish, and tossed it into the sea.

‚ÄúIt matters to this one,‚Äù he said.","transform":"

14/07/23, 16:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Sumaila!
How are you?

I am so happy to have you here on the EWYL Line!
14/07/23, 16:51 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
14/07/23, 16:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù


2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
14/07/23, 16:58 - Sumaila EWYL22E0343: okay, I get it
14/07/23, 17:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Tomorrow I will be sharing the weekend activity with you, and yes in our next session onwards, we will discuss about the projects.
14/07/23, 17:09 - Sumaila EWYL22E0343: okay
