Let's make it exciting‚Äîreflect on your journey this year and share your aspirations for the next. What dreams do you want to chase in 2024?

29/12/23, 13:51 - Malcolm EWYL23E0654: To study and become a medical biotechnologist
29/12/23, 14:05 - Ananya: Great, you know, 2023 is wrapping up. Don't you think we should kick off the new year with something big? How about committing to earning a specific amount of scholarship credits?
After all, you wouldn't want to head to India empty-handed.

I'm saying this from my own experience ‚Äì having some credits before you arrive in India isn't just a benefit for you; it's a help for your parents too. Not only this, we often pick students for internships and personal training based on their credits and regularity in the EWYL journey.
Believe me, you've got plenty of time right now being in your home country, so don;t you think we should utilize this time with our utmost dedication?
29/12/23, 14:23 - Malcolm EWYL23E0654: Yes that‚Äôs true
29/12/23, 14:24 - Ananya: Now, Malcolm, the weekend is arriving, and after this weekend, we will be landing in a completely new year, which is going to be special as you step into a new journey of your life. I want you to begin this journey with some productivity. Therefore, I am giving you a small target for the weekend. Connect with at least 4 students and submit their application forms with me.
Since you are working on your own credits, could you work on this diligently? Remember, your hard work now is something that will help you in your future endeavors! This is me speaking from experience!
29/12/23, 14:25 - Malcolm EWYL23E0654: Yes please l can do that
29/12/23, 14:26 - Malcolm EWYL23E0654: L already connected with some students and l will ask them again if they are really interested l already gave some of the students forms to fill in and l be collecting them soon
29/12/23, 15:09 - Ananya: Now as I am concluding our session I want to share something with you, as your mentor, I am invested in ensuring your success and growth. In light of this, I've decided to implement a change in our process. Moving forward you have to submit your lesson response before the beginning of our session. Only then will I move ahead with the session and mark your attendance. If you want, you can submit your response immediately after receiving the activity or lesson.
29/12/23, 15:09 - Ananya: Greetings on this beautiful day!‚ú®

As we embark on a new year, it's the perfect time to reflect on our aspirations and set goals for personal and academic growth. To kick off our Saturday activity, we invite you to share the goals you've set for yourself in the upcoming year, 2024.üéØ

Whether your goals are related to academics, personal development, extracurricular activities, or any other aspect of your life, we want to hear about them! This is a wonderful opportunity for us to inspire and support one another as a community.

Please take a moment to jot down your goals and be prepared to share them during our Saturday activity. It could be something as simple as improving your study habits, achieving a certain grade, learning a new skill, or even fostering better connections with your peers.‚ú®

Remember, setting goals is not only a way to envision your future but also a roadmap to success. By sharing your goals, you might inspire someone else to reach for their dreams as well.

Let's make 2024 a year of growth, achievement, and mutual support. We look forward to hearing about your aspirations during our Saturday activity.ü§ù

Best regards,

02/01/24, 13:05 - Ananya: Good morning, Malcolm!

Before we dive into today's session, I'm curious ‚Äì how was your New Year? Did you have a chance to celebrate and welcome the new chapter?

Your dedication to excelling in your studies, seizing the opportunities provided by the scholarship, and contributing to the community through volunteering is commendable.
02/01/24, 13:18 - Malcolm EWYL23E0654: Thankyou very much
02/01/24, 13:21 - Ananya: Also, Great job on submitting the form! I've forwarded it to our dedicated counseling team. Now, let's keep the momentum going by staying in close touch with the students and promptly addressing any questions or concerns they might have. Together, we're making a positive impact! üåü

02/01/24, 13:32 - Ananya: This morning, the head of our department, Ms. Sanjana, and I discussed our students' performance in the EWYL project. I am delighted to see how consistently you have been performing, especially in the community-building project. Not only have I recognized your efforts and performance, but Ms. Sanjana has also acknowledged them.

The commitment to excellence exhibited by both Yeukai and Edoofa symbolizes the ethos of continuous improvement and dedication to empowering the next generation of leaders.
05/01/24, 13:15 - Ananya: Good morning, Malcolm!

Every day is a new beginning, take a deep breath and start afresh. On this note, let us begin our session and make a change together! ‚òÄÔ∏èüåº
05/01/24, 13:16 - Malcolm EWYL23E0654: Morning lm alright 
L hope you are well
05/01/24, 13:16 - Malcolm EWYL23E0654: That is okay we can begin please
05/01/24, 13:25 - Ananya: Great! So for today, we will be discussing our third project which is the school reform mission. I will share a few tips and tricks for it! Are you ready?
05/01/24, 13:26 - Malcolm EWYL23E0654: Yes that is great lm ready please
05/01/24, 13:33 - Ananya: Alright, So, there are two ways to work on the African School Reform project:


A. *Connecting with school virtually*-
‚ñ™Ô∏è In this you would have to find the contacts of the schools through your peers, friends, neighbors, cousins, school teachers, and school heads.
‚ñ™Ô∏èThen introduce yourself to them professionally and state the purpose of connecting with them along with their available time.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share information about Edoofa that I will be providing you in order to help them understand the Program deeply and with more clarity.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share the school form with them, and if they are interested in connecting with us, then our aim should be to get the form filled.
05/01/24, 13:35 - Malcolm EWYL23E0654: Oooh ü§îalright
05/01/24, 13:39 - Ananya: B. *Visiting schools physically*

‚ñ™Ô∏è Now by this, as it clearly says, you have to visit schools nearby and inform them about Edoofa.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Visiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏è With this, you will surely gain a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, overcome the fear of presenting yourself and your family Edoofa, spontaneously in front of anyone at any point.
05/01/24, 13:42 - Malcolm EWYL23E0654: Yes that is correct
05/01/24, 13:45 - Ananya: This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success
‚ñ™Ô∏èVisiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear of presenting himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.
05/01/24, 13:45 - Ananya: .
05/01/24, 13:47 - Malcolm EWYL23E0654: Wow that‚Äôs amazing
05/01/24, 13:57 - Ananya: So, Malcolm what do you think about these ideas? Do you think these are useful?
05/01/24, 14:01 - Malcolm EWYL23E0654: Yes please they are especially the one about visiting the schools physically,l think that‚Äôs a great idea
05/01/24, 14:10 - Ananya: Absolutely! You know what, Malcolm? Last year around this time, I used to set a monthly target for my students based on their fees. They would set a goal to earn a particular amount in that month to cover their tuition fees. This approach really helped many of my students. When they arrived in India, they had one semester's worth of fees saved up, as they had been planning for it for a year. Recently, all of them have redeemed their credits to pay their tuition fees. I feel so content and happy because this was my wish for those students. I am thinking of preparing the same idea, what do you think?
05/01/24, 14:22 - Malcolm EWYL23E0654: Wow this sounds like a great idea
05/01/24, 14:25 - Ananya: Absolutely! We will begin this in our next session. Now, as you wrap up today's endeavors, remember: 'Believe you can and you're halfway there.' - Theodore Roosevelt. Your efforts today are the foundation for your success tomorrow. Keep pushing forward with confidence and determination. üí™
05/01/24, 14:28 - Malcolm EWYL23E0654: Alright thankyou very much , l will surely try not to fail and dissapoint
14/01/24, 16:39 - Malcolm EWYL23E0654: Lm a proud EDOOFIAN

I hope this message finds you well. I'm excited to share a sneak peek of this Wednesday's lesson, where we will be delving into the key learnings from the timeless classic, "Think and Grow Rich" by Napoleon Hill.

In this session, we will explore the transformative principles outlined in the book that have guided countless individuals on their journey to success and prosperity. From the power of positive thinking and definiteness of purpose to the significance of collaboration and visualization, we will unravel the wealth of wisdom embedded in Hill's masterpiece.

Whether you're already familiar with the book or discovering it for the first time, this lesson promises to provide valuable insights that you can apply to your personal and professional life.
Looking forward to an inspiring and insightful Wednesday session!

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.

14/10/23, 16:36 - Ananya: As part of our ongoing commitment to personal growth and self-improvement, I'd like you to take a moment to reflect on the key takeaways from the lesson. Identify one specific goal you want to achieve based on our discussions. Be sure to make it SMART. Lastly, identify one significant distraction that you are willing to remove or reduce to bolster your focus and productivity.

Let's reconvene next week to discuss our progress, share our experiences, and support each other in our personal development journeys. I look forward to hearing from you and working together to achieve our goals.

18/11/23, 16:17 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!

25/11/23, 21:02 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL
