Today's Wednesday Wisdom is not just special but carries a powerful reminder of the true essence of Christmas. As we stand on the brink of the festive season, it's crucial to reflect on the values that unite us as a community.

Beyond the glittering lights and festive decorations, Christmas serves as a poignant reminder of the core values that bind humanity together. It's a time when love, compassion, and generosity take center stage, fostering a sense of togetherness and shared joy.

Let's take a moment today to embrace the spirit of Christmas, appreciating the significance of our connections with one another. The lessons learned during this festive season go beyond the celebration itself, leaving a lasting impact on the way we interact with those around us.

May this Wednesday Wisdom inspire you to carry the spirit of Christmas not just during the holiday season but throughout the year! üéÑ‚ú®

Wishing you a joyous and reflective Wednesday!

Warm regards,
Team EWYL

21/12/23, 16:23 - Adonai EWYL23E0947: Okay they are really okay
21/12/23, 16:28 - Jasmine Kaur: As we approach the end of the year with just 10 days remaining

I want you to give your utmost dedication and focus on accomplishing your goals.
This is an opportune moment, especially considering that many individuals are free during the holidays and available for conversations.
So are you prepared to invest your full efforts in making the most of the last 10 days of 2023?
21/12/23, 16:31 - Adonai EWYL23E0947: Yes
21/12/23, 16:36 - Jasmine Kaur: Absolutely! To make our end-of-year push more effective, let's set a tangible goal to keep track of your progress. I'm suggesting a target of submitting 5 applications for Community Building and one school application before December 31, 2023.
I believe in your capabilities and encourage you to give it your all to achieve this milestone.
Can you commit to putting in your best effort to meet this goal?
21/12/23, 16:38 - Adonai EWYL23E0947: Yes l can do it
21/12/23, 16:39 - Jasmine Kaur: Great, So please go ahead and share with me on how are you going to achieve this target?
21/12/23, 16:44 - Jasmine Kaur: Adonai, May I know that are you finding it hard to reply to my message?
21/12/23, 16:45 - Adonai EWYL23E0947: Am going to look for my classmates and share with them
21/12/23, 16:46 - Adonai EWYL23E0947: And l will also approach my school
21/12/23, 16:50 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, To meet your goal of submitting 5 community-building applications, your task is to connect with at least 10 students and give them a quick overview of the Edoofa Scholarship program. Encourage them to fill out the application form to apply for the scholarship. Upon completion, they'll gain access to free counseling sessions where experienced counselors will provide one-on-one career guidance.
21/12/23, 16:58 - Adonai EWYL23E0947: Ok ma'am
21/12/23, 16:59 - Adonai EWYL23E0947: If l submit more than 5 application is it okay
21/12/23, 17:02 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes Adonai
21/12/23, 17:02 - Jasmine Kaur: Given that schools are currently closed, your approach would involve reaching out to headmasters via WhatsApp. Provide a concise introduction about the Edoofa Scholarship Program, and if they express interest, inform them that once they share the offline filled form with you, you can facilitate a connection with the program director. This connection will allow them to delve deeper into the program's details and explore the benefits it offers to schools.
21/12/23, 17:04 - Adonai EWYL23E0947: Ok
21/12/23, 17:12 - Jasmine Kaur: Did you get a little more clarity on how to move ahead with the projects?
21/12/23, 17:20 - Adonai EWYL23E0947: Yes l have
21/12/23, 17:20 - Jasmine Kaur: Awesome! It's time to conclude our session. It was wonderful chatting with you, and I wish you all the best. I have complete confidence that you can reach your goal, but I encourage you to give it your absolute best‚Äîput in that 100%.
Have a fantastic day ahead!
21/12/23, 17:21 - Adonai EWYL23E0947: Thank you
