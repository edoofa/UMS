22/08/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Rodwell!
How are you?
22/08/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
22/08/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù
22/08/23, 16:39 - Saloni Rastogi: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter

3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
22/08/23, 16:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *09:30-11:00 AM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
22/08/23, 16:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?

Hope you are doing well, I would like to announce that today is a holiday on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan which is an auspicious Indian Festival so I am sharing the lesson with you today!

So for this week's Wednesday lesson,  I have an exciting topic to delve into: Hidden Talent.
We'll dive into the captivating story of Samuel, a character whose seemingly ordinary life takes a fascinating turn when his secret talent comes to light. Through his story, we'll discover the power of talents that lie beneath the surface, waiting for the perfect moment to shine.
So, bring your curiosity and imagination as we delve into Samuel's tale and discuss the significance of hidden talents in our own lives. You might even find yourself reflecting on your own unique abilities that are yet to be revealed.

In our upcoming session I would like to know if you have a hidden talent that you're particularly good at or passionate about? It could be anything ‚Äì from artistic pursuits to something more unexpected.

Get ready to be inspired, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together!

Hidden talents are like sparkling gems waiting to be discovered in the depths of our souls. They are the beautiful secrets that each of us carries, often concealed by the noise of everyday life. What makes them truly magnificent is the element of surprise they bring when they finally emerge. These talents are the unexpected strokes of genius, the melodies of the heart, and the sparks of creativity that add unique colors to the canvas of our lives. Having a hidden talent is like possessing a precious treasure chest of abilities that can enrich our existence and connect us with our true selves. It's a reminder of the limitless potential that resides within each individual, waiting for the right moment to dazzle the world.

12/09/23, 16:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings my _lovely student_
How are you doing?

Here is an amazing story of Alex that I found from my very close repository. I hope you like itüíõ

In a bustling city, Alex, facing a learning disability and financial strain, struggled academically. Undeterred, they developed unique study techniques and worked tirelessly, balancing school with part-time employment. During their final year, Alex sought help and accommodations.

When the results arrived, everyone was astonished. Despite their challenges, Alex had achieved one of the highest scores in school. This remarkable success showcased that with unwavering determination, hard work, and the right support, anyone can overcome obstacles and excel academically, inspiring all who knew their story.
14/09/23, 14:15 - Rodwell EWYL23E0334: I'm sorry Ms Saloni these days I'm preparing for my final examinations so that's why some time I would be out
14/09/23, 17:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Rodwell!
How are you?
14/09/23, 17:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
14/09/23, 17:50 - Saloni Rastogi: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to -sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, saloni.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.

15/11/23, 15:41 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy Wednesday! üåü
Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
