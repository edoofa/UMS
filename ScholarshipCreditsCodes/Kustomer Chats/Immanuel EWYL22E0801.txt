17/03/23, 00:25 - Unknown: For the community building project, you’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

TENDAI\/MENTOR NAME\/1FEB2023
17/03/23, 00:25 - Unknown: Then, we need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.
17/03/23, 00:25 - Unknown: First of all, make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community building project, YOU ADD ME and make me the ADMIN of the Group.
Add my number

17/03/23, 00:29 - Immanuel EWYL22E0801: In that group I will add every student or each student will  have his or her own group
17/03/23, 00:30 - Unknown: You will be adding the students Immanuel
17/03/23, 00:30 - Unknown: The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
17/03/23, 00:30 - Unknown: As for attracting the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 5, and Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

20/03/23, 17:42 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian!

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!","transform":"

During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.
