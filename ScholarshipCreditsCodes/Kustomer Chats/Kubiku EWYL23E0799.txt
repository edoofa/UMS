I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.
As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!
For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.
By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.
Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it with the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.
Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!
Best,

Team EWYL!

After that, let's switch gears and delve into the thrilling progress we've made on our projects. It's going to be an engaging session, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts and contributions on the EWYL Line.
27/11/23, 16:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Kubiku, you have not received your Saturday activity because you have not followed the daily ritual for the past three days. May I know the challenges?
27/11/23, 16:09 - Saloni Rastogi: You can share the forms with me here, on the EWYL Line.

27/11/23, 16:23 - Kubiku EWYL23E0799: have got some stomach pains coz of acids that were very high
27/11/23, 16:26 - Saloni Rastogi: I'm sorry to hear about your discomfort due to high stomach acids. To alleviate this issue, consider adopting dietary changes and lifestyle habits. Incorporating foods that are gentle on the stomach, such as bananas, oatmeal, and yogurt, can help. Additionally, avoid spicy and acidic foods, and opt for smaller, more frequent meals. Drinking plenty of water and avoiding lying down immediately after meals can aid digestion. If symptoms persist, it's advisable to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and potential medication to regulate stomach acid levels.
27/11/23, 16:26 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know how are you feeling now?

27/11/23, 16:39 - Saloni Rastogi: As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."
As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals?
Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.
Best regards,

Team EWYL

27/11/23, 22:43 - Kubiku EWYL23E0799: *what l have understood of the spirit of competition and it's meaning

The spirit of competition referes to the competitive drive and energy that people bring to game or competition. It's about the joy and excitement of competing ,the sense of accomplishment that comes from pushing yourself and the feeling of belongs to a community of like-minded people
27/11/23, 22:52 - Kubiku EWYL23E0799: *how has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals

When your approach challenges and goals with the spirit of competition, you're more likely to be motivated, determined, and focused. You'll be more likely to push yourself to the limit, and you'll be more likely to overcome obstacles. You'll also be more likely to learn from your mistakes and to celebrate your successes. The spirit of competition can also help you to stay positive and focused, even when things get tough
27/11/23, 22:59 - Kubiku EWYL23E0799: *a real-life example where your spirit of competition played a pivotal role in achieving success

A good example that the spirit of competition helped me was studying for an exam. Let's say you're struggling to focus on your studies. If you approach your studies with the spirit of competition, you might set a goal to earn a certain grade on your next exam. You might find ways to make studying more fun and engaging, and you might feel more motivated to put in the work to reach your goal. That's what helped me
