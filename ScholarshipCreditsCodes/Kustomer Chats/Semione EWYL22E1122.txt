Greetings Ms. Salon, I am Semione Mhone and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. 
My EWYL group name is EWYL22E1122.
27/03/23, 19:40 - Semione EWYL22E1122: Yes madam, am ready
27/03/23, 19:41 - Saloni Rastogi: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

27/03/23, 20:51 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Semione!
How are you?
27/03/23, 20:51 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
27/03/23, 20:51 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
27/03/23, 20:51 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
27/03/23, 21:53 - Semione EWYL22E1122: Sorry my phone is down, shall we continue tomorrow madam?
27/03/23, 23:36 - Saloni Rastogi: No worries Semione, but for this week, we will be having the sessions till tomorrow since we are visiting our _proud Indian edoofian_  from Wednesday to Saturday.
28/03/23, 03:12 - Semione EWYL22E1122: Alright madam, well understood.
28/03/23, 17:29 - Semione EWYL22E1122: I am proud EDOOFIAN. 
Greetings!  Good morning ?!
28/03/23, 17:33 - Saloni Rastogi: Alright, I have noted your answer, the correct answer will be revealed shortly.","transform":"
28/03/23, 17:34 - Saloni Rastogi: The correct answer is A. Zambezi

Do you know? 

The Zambezi River is the fourth-longest river in Africa, the longest east-flowing river in Africa and the largest flowing into the Indian Ocean from Africa.","transform":"
28/03/23, 17:34 - Semione EWYL22E1122: Alright.
28/03/23, 17:36 - Semione EWYL22E1122: Yes!  Am aware of that and it is about 2600km long.
29/03/23, 00:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for the delayed response, I was occupied in an internal meeting with the team with was to be attended as a priority about our visit starting tomorrow till Saturday.
As informed, no sessions will be held during this time and we will begin afresh from next week onwards where I will be sharing some crazy and interesting insights with you.
But this will only be done, we you will NOT MISS these *THREE THINGS*:
1) Timely submission of the Wednesday lesson and weekend activity
2) Daily following the ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', the absence of which can lead to not sharing of weekly lessons and activities with you
3) and most importantly, *PROGRESS ON PROJECTS*

I will be tracking the progress on _Monday_.
I completely know that these two weeks, we might not have dedicated discussions on the projects. So in my absence, I want that you think in-depth about *the project you are doing, revising the targets for the same, and completing it*.
I would really be emotional and happy that in a few months, many of the new edoofians will be joining our Indian family here. And honestly, I will be happier that we start preparing now for the future because growth is not measured in one day. We need to work hard consistently and dedicatedly.

Like I always say ‘1 step daily means 1 step UP. 0 step daily means 1 step DOWN’.
I trust you, just believe in yourself.
29/03/23, 03:58 - Semione EWYL22E1122: Noted madam, thanks alot.

07/04/23, 22:39 - Saloni Rastogi: It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

Below are my response from Wednesday lesson  and a message to my  mentor.
09/04/23, 02:03 - Semione EWYL22E1122: WHAT I LEARNT FROM WEDNESDAY LESSON

In the first place,I would like to say that consistence hard work leads to success and greatness will come upon it.
It is consistence which leads to success in any aspect of life same applies to student's skill development and career growth.

Consistence helps students to success in studies, practice and learning in academic success.
It helps students to understand and retain the concepts better,which ultimately reflects in their grades.
Consistence sometimes helps for developing skills in sports and music and more.

In this case,regular practice in students,it helps that particular student to develop muscle memory and improve their technique and building a better performance in class.


In conclusion, consistence in learning is crucial for career growth because learning proceed even if the person is a graduate.
