15/01/24, 23:03 - Blessing EWYL23E1005: That's such a fun question to kick things off! I'd have to say that the Grand Canyon would be my first choice. There's just something so majestic and awe-inspiring about this natural wonder. The sheer size and beauty of the canyon is unlike anything else in the world. And there's so much to explore, from hiking and camping to whitewater rafting and exploring the ancient Native American ruins. What about you? If you could go anywhere, where would you go?
15/01/24, 23:05 - Jasmine Kaur: Well, Done on sharing the 3 applications ðŸŒŸ It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, you must maintain regular communication with the students and address any queries they may have. Our counseling team will be reaching out to them directly within the next 15-20 days.

15/01/24, 23:06 - Jasmine Kaur: As for me, if I could go anywhere, my dream would be to travel and explore the diverse cultures within India. The rich tapestry of traditions, languages, and landscapes across the country is something I find immensely fascinating. Each region has its own unique charm, and I believe there's so much to learn and appreciate within our own borders
