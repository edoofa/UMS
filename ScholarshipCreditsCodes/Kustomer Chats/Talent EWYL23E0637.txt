I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.

Happy Saturday! We hope you're all feeling fantastic today. As part of our Saturday activity, we have something special in store for you that's all about celebrating our Edoofian pride!

Today's activity is all about showcasing your pride as an Edoofian. We want you to flaunt your badge of honor, that feeling of being a proud Edoofian, and record a short video saying, "I am a proud Edoofian, and here's one reason why." This is your opportunity to share your Edoofian spirit and what makes you proud to be part of our community.

We can't wait to see your videos and hear your stories of Edoofian pride! Remember, this activity is all about celebrating our unique journeys and what makes our community so special⭐

Best regards,
TEAM EWYL
18/11/23, 16:17 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one – it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
