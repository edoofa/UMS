25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:07 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:33 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
12/07/22, 19:09 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian,
Please make sure that you are active during our scheduled sessions otherwise due to this, We miss out on many important things that are scheduled to be discussed during our session timings.

Now, Since, We were not able to complete our discussion yesterday, Let us try to cover up what was left today.
12/07/22, 20:59 - Unknown: Joel, are we connected ?
13/07/22, 01:04 - Joel EWYL21E0902: Sorry sir I was experiencing power cuts
13/07/22, 01:11 - Unknown: Joel, I am Ms.Riva
13/07/22, 01:11 - Unknown: Please do not call me sir
13/07/22, 01:14 - Joel EWYL21E0902: Oooh very sorry mem
13/07/22, 01:14 - Joel EWYL21E0902: Sorry I was not aware I  am very sorry mem
13/07/22, 19:24 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
Let us start our day with a quote  is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence*
13/07/22, 19:24 - Unknown: Also, I understand what you are saying.
I am your mentor *Ms.Riva* and I will help you cover everything as well.
But, my proud edoofian you need to be consistent and loyal for me to trust you.
You have to work with me and you have to prove yourself because only then I would be able to help.
13/07/22, 22:26 - Joel EWYL21E0902: Good afternoon I am a proud Edoofian ?
13/07/22, 22:28 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
