25/08/22, 21:19 - Unknown: The Class of 2022, as well as new graduate and professional students, have settled in but many are probably wondering what the next few years holds for them with Edoofa. One key element of Orientation is, as its name implies, getting students going in the right direction. Part of that is feeling welcomed and at home here on campus. Part is learning how to put your best foot forward, regardless of your backgrounds and previous experiences.

We are planning a pre-orientation session because the orientation programme will now take place in the first few weeks of September. This session will be led by Ms. Davi, who will inform you of a few crucial details and have a wonderful surprise in store for everyone of you.

The pre-orientation will take place through Google meet on Friday, 26th August, 7:30 PM IST 

Link:  https:\/\/meet.google.com\/com-cskt-dkp

Kindly join 10 minutes in advance as the session will start exactly at 7:30 PM and students joining post 7:30 PM will not be allowed to join.
25/08/22, 22:21 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0308: Okay
