16/12/22, 20:32 - Kelvin EWYL22E0590: From my understanding the name secret Santa evolved from there being acts of kindness towards another. It all began from when Larry Dean Stewart was helped in his time of need and this also motivated him to help those who are also in need once he was in a better place. He would help the needy in their times of difficulties anytime he could. This got him the name Secret Santa. He the went on to train others people to also do the same. Now Santa are many in number. Larry Dean also went on to look for Ted who helped him back then and repayed him for his kindness. All that Secret Santa asks for¬† from the people he helps is for them to do the same when they get the chance. This promotes kindness around the world.
16/12/22, 20:33 - Kelvin EWYL22E0590: My understanding from the Wednesday lesson

17/12/22, 21:34 - Tenzin: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special ‚Äî the receiver‚Äôs happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver‚Äôs eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, 
_I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?_

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

20/12/22, 19:18 - Kelvin EWYL22E0590: As someone who grasped and understood the evolving and where the name Secret Santa evolved from, this has motivated and inspired me to be someone's Secret Santa as one's joy is also joy to the giver. So i decided to also get a chance to expirience the joy of having to make someone happy to because the act of kindness is beneficial to us both. So I have decided to be a secret Santa to my little cousin by the name Victor Chaunoda. Victor is actually my little brother since he is my father's brother's son. I have decided to gift Victor with clothes and shoes. I have decided to buy him a few new clothes and shoes and then add on some of my own clothes that I no longer wear because I can no longer fit into them. This is something I saw necessary and sonething that would bring joy to Victor and his mother both. I had plan to do this because Victor comes from a less privileged family where it is just him and his mother. Victor lost his father who was also my uncle back when he was still younger. After so happened I have always felt sorry for him as it is something painful to lose someone so important to you at such a small age. So I plan on being his Secret Santa this Christmas when we visit them for Christmas in the rural areas. I feel like in doing so I would have done the Secret Santa act since it all comes from there being an act of kindness towards others.

20/12/22, 21:09 - Kelvin EWYL22E0590: From my understanding the name secret Santa evolved from there being acts of kindness towards another. It all began from when Larry Dean Stewart was helped in his time of need and this also motivated him to help those who are also in need once he was in a better place. He would help the needy in their times of difficulties anytime he could. This got him the name Secret Santa. He the went on to train others people to also do the same. Now Santa are many in number. Larry Dean also went on to look for Ted who helped him back then and repayed him for his kindness. All that Secret Santa asks for¬† from the people he helps is for them to do the same when they get the chance. This promotes kindness around the world.
