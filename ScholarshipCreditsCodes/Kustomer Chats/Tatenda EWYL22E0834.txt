25/04/23, 05:20 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian, ready for a motivational monday?

In a remote village, there lives a hardworking farmer who owns a farm. Over the years his grapery yields rich crops, and the farmer is very successful. He has three sons, who are young and energetic but never worry about working. As the farmer grows older, he begins to worry about his sons‚Äô future.

Then he becomes very ill and feels that his death is coming soon. He calls his sons and says,

‚ÄúDear sons, I see my death approaching, but I want to share a secret before you all leave. These areas have treasure hidden inside. Dig the whole area after my death, to find it. ‚Äù

The old farmer died. The sons start digging for money without leaving any part of the field but nothing is found. In any case, digging their fields leads to healthier crops and results in higher incomes. These earnings make the sons realize what their father means.

What according to you is the moral of the story?

a. Hard work always pays off. The fruits of hard work are always sweet.
b. Be Selflessly kind
c. both a & b
25/04/23, 12:52 - Tatenda EWYL22E0834: Good morning sir
25/04/23, 13:00 - Tatenda EWYL22E0834: I think the moral of the story is hard work always  pays off.the fruits of hard work are always sweet
25/04/23, 13:12 - Ananya: Good Morning, *Tatenda*üåÖ
I hope that you are doing well‚ú®

2. How are you planning to earn these credits? Here explain your plan in detail.

For example: Corporate Alliance: I will share 10 Forms
Communuty Building: I will share 10 Forms
African School Education Reform Mission Project: I will share 5 Forms

Please share this with me by the day end.
Have a cheerful day ahead!
25/04/23, 22:19 - Tatenda EWYL22E0834: No sir
26/04/23, 04:55 - Tatenda EWYL22E0834: Good morning Sir
26/04/23, 04:55 - Tatenda EWYL22E0834: Sir lm very very sorry for what l did today it was very wrong not to remember what you told me.....l was disturbed when you asked me if l was interested in the EWYL program.....from today onwards l promise to work as hard as l can
26/04/23, 05:32 - Tatenda EWYL22E0834: For the month of May l want to work hard as l can to cover up for the month of April 


 1.So this is what l intend to do ...l want to earn a maximum  of $ 70 credit



2 Mainly on the African reform project.On this project lm planning to add 5 more schools on the schools that l communicated with and l hope and pray it will be successful but this time instead of communicating with the schools online l will go to the schools in person for progress sake 

Moving on, looking at community building lm planning something like $100 credits if possible.This is what lm going to do l will make sure that atleast five students will pay their first part of the enrollment fee offwhich for every student its $20 dollars and if l can get 5 students it will be a $100.Adding to that maybe two of the students will proceed to the admission of the university that is $60 dollars but probably this takes two months so l put aside the $60
26/04/23, 05:34 - Tatenda EWYL22E0834: I'm a  proud Edoofian who is willing to work from today onwards
