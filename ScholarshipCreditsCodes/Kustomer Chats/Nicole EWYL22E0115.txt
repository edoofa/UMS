18/07/22, 20:41 - Nicole EWYL22E0115: In my community the fastest growing industry is the food industry. Many new establishments are being set up daily that focus on buying and selling food items to people, from basic items such as drinks and sweets, to fast food and groceries that can be used daily. The rapid growth of the business could be as a result of the increase in demand of these items due to population growth. The main increase seems to be focused on fast food. People prefer it because it is very fast to prepare therefore sells at a faster rate, and also because customers prefer it since it is convenient. Many establishments are being set up from small stalls in the street,  to  restaurants all with the main goal of gaining profit from  this business. It is predicted that over the long run people will still benefit and make profits from this particular industry, because population numbers are continuing to rise, and therefore the demand for food will always be high. However due to the rise in competition between retailers, some businesses could suffer losses because customers may prefer the services being provided by competitors which could result in the decline of some of businesses.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
