20/06/23, 19:34 - Sharon EWYL23E0203: Question 
Similarities and dissimilarities between the entrepreneur l have chose Ruvhuneko Parirenyatwa and myself.

There are four different entrepreneurs described on the Wednesday Wisdom who have made significant contributions to entrepreneurship and have become motivational figures in Zimbabwe .Ruvheneko Parirenyatwa is one of the entrepreneurs who has motivated myself .l would like to clarify the differences and similarities between myself and Ruvheneko Parinyatwa .

Starting with dissimilarities between myself and Ruvheneko Parinyatwa.She is a prominent media personality and entrepreneur in Zimbabwe.She is a radio and television talk show host,master of ceremony voice over artist brand ambassador and philanthropist.This came out as a huge difference because l am still working on my self through planning to go to University to become prominent entrepreneur as her.

Ruvheneko is a entrepreneur who has established her own media production company .She is managing director in Neko Media .As compare to myself ,l do have my own media production company.However it really inspired me that  as a woman l can also be able to hold those huge position world wide .

Moving forward to similarities ,Ruvheneko Parirenyatwa is a hardworking woman and capable for holding many responsibilities and positions such being one of the speakers at the Deutsche Welle's in Germany and she use her platform to advocate for youth empowerment and social change.I am a person who is a hardworker and capable for holding many positions for example lm a vice chairperson in Youth department in our church at national level .l am also part of the guidance and counseling department for youths in our church as secretary.

I have also discovered that Ruvheneko Parirenyatwa is a Zimvabwean female entrepreneur same as myself .She is also uplifting the Zimbabwean flag world wide and l also represent my country as being an Edoofian and for the time l will be in India.

In a summation l have learned that anyone can also be an entrepreneur through working hard and have passion in section you are working in.

I also learned that true leadership requires the courage to make difficult decisions and the passion to uplift others in challenging times .This is clearly proved by Ellen Johnson during liberia's tumultuous periods of political instability and civil war.She emerged as a beacon of hope .She also prioritized integrity and faught against corruption through establishing system to promote transparency and accountability .

Sirleaf inspire me a lot as an example to challenge gender stereotypes ,advocate for equal opportunities and create an inclusive society that celebrates diversity.This is shown as she is the first elected female head of state in Africa  and it paved the way for countless women.She also inspired me that as student of Edoofa l should value education ,seize opportunities for growth and and work towards empowering themselves and other communities.


I learned that collaboration and diplomacy are essential tools for achieving shared goals and promoting peace and stability.As students of Edoofa we should understand the importance of preserving our planet and strive to be responsible stewards of the environment ,contributing to a sustainable future.As student l should embrace my ability to effect change ,no matter my age or background and inspire to leave a positive and lasting legacy in my communities.

Our chosen figure is Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of Liberia and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Through her remarkable leadership and unwavering determination, she has left an indelible mark on history. Let's draw valuable lessons from her life for our personal development.

Two traits that stand out about Ellen Johnson Sirleaf are resilience and visionary leadership. These qualities can greatly contribute to our growth and development as individuals. They can positively impact our academic pursuits, relationships, and future career goals.

To develop resilience, we can learn from Sirleaf's ability to bounce back from challenges. We can seek out difficult experiences and learn from them, cultivating a mindset of perseverance and adaptability.

Here are some suggestions to help you get started:

Identify two traits: Reflect on Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's qualities that resonate with you.

Reflect on personal development: Consider how these traits can positively impact your academic pursuits, relationships, or future career goals.

Create an action plan: Outline practical steps like seeking mentorship, practicing self-discipline, engaging in community service, or pursuing relevant courses and extracurricular activities.

Comment if you have been working on the community building project and how many aspiring Edoofians have enrolled through you!
28/06/23, 16:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

Alex focused on embodying the qualities of the person he aspired to be .Everyone at school noticed that he had improved and he created a studgroup which helped them to to redefine their own identities.
