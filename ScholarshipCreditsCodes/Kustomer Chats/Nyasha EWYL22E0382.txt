08/08/22, 22:34 - Unknown: One can be called successful if they have achieved their desired goals. For some people, being successful means being rich. But being successful is even more than being rich. When you achieve what you want, it gives you immense pleasure, and that is incomparable with being rich. To be successful in any aspect of life, one needs to have strong dedication and work hard. 
Our WEEKEND ACTIVITY discussed the traits of a successful person.
So, in our session today, we will:
1. discuss your understanding of the weekend activity.
2. make weekly plans on achieving targets on three ongoing projects.
