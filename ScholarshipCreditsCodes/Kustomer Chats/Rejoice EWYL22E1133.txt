08/12/23, 15:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!

Hope you're doing well!
I'm excited to catch up with you. Let's chat about the Wednesday lesson ‚Äì what stuck with you the most?

And, of course, I'm curious about how things are going with the projects.
Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and checking out your progress! üòä
08/12/23, 15:44 - Rejoice EWYL22E1133: Greetings to you too I am doing good and the projects are progressing on well but the headmaster of my school has not yet replied my requests
08/12/23, 15:45 - Rejoice EWYL22E1133: I understood how the excel is useful to the life of an Edoofian
08/12/23, 15:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share the screenshot of your conversation with the headmasters?
08/12/23, 15:59 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you elaborate more on what you know about excel?
08/12/23, 16:01 - Rejoice EWYL22E1133: I changed my WhatsApp after my GBWHATSAPP crashed but after I asked him what time he would be free, and he did not reply the following day l greeted him and send him a video of the edoofa founders with Dr auxillia Mnangagwa but he never replied
08/12/23, 16:03 - Rejoice EWYL22E1133: I understood that it is used in various fields for example finance and academics field and also it make data presentation on charts and graphs a lot more easier
08/12/23, 16:16 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know if you called them and tried to take a follow up?
08/12/23, 16:16 - Saloni Rastogi: I am glad to hear what you have said about Excel?
08/12/23, 16:17 - Rejoice EWYL22E1133: Not yet but i will take a follow up today
08/12/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi: There are two ways to work on the African School Reform project:
08/12/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi: A. *Connecting with school virtually*-

‚ñ™Ô∏è In this you would have to find the contacts of the schools through your peers, friends, neighbors, cousins, school teachers, and school heads.
‚ñ™Ô∏èThen introduce yourself to them professionally and state the purpose of connecting with them along with their available time.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share information about Edoofa that I will be providing you in order to help them understand the Program deeply and with more clarity.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share the school form with them, and if they are interested in connecting with us, then our aim should be to get the form filled.
08/12/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi: This is something you are already doing.
08/12/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi: B. *Visiting schools physically*


‚ñ™Ô∏è Now by this, as it clearly says, you have to visit schools nearby and inform them about Edoofa.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Visiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏è With this, you will surely gain a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, overcome the fear of presenting yourself and your family Edoofa, spontaneously in front of anyone at any point.
08/12/23, 16:39 - Saloni Rastogi: What have you thought on this?
08/12/23, 16:40 - Rejoice EWYL22E1133: I have thought about the option B but I have not yet gathered the resources to travel around but for now I will continue pushing virtually
08/12/23, 16:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Incase you feel physically visiting can be tough then of course we have option 1.
09/12/23, 08:25 - Rejoice EWYL22E1133: I'm a proud Edoofian
09/12/23, 08:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

09/12/23, 19:00 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!
09/12/23, 19:12 - Rejoice EWYL22E1133: Ok noted so can l download the excel app on my mobile phone

üöÄ Brace yourself for a lesson sprinkled with knowledge and a dash of holiday cheer! üéÑüéÅ

Today's Wednesday Wisdom is not just special but carries a powerful reminder of the true essence of Christmas. As we stand on the brink of the festive season, it's crucial to reflect on the values that unite us as a community.

Beyond the glittering lights and festive decorations, Christmas serves as a poignant reminder of the core values that bind humanity together. It's a time when love, compassion, and generosity take center stage, fostering a sense of togetherness and shared joy.

Let's take a moment today to embrace the spirit of Christmas, appreciating the significance of our connections with one another. The lessons learned during this festive season go beyond the celebration itself, leaving a lasting impact on the way we interact with those around us.

May this Wednesday Wisdom inspire you to carry the spirit of Christmas not just during the holiday season but throughout the year! üéÑ‚ú®

Wishing you a joyous and reflective Wednesday!

Warm regards,
