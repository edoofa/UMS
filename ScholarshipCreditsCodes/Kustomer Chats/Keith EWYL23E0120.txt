02/06/23, 18:37 - Jasmine Kaur: Keith, you have just sent me the lesson. You are supposed to read the lesson and then share your understanding.
03/06/23, 02:41 - Keith EWYL23E0120: When you surround yourself with positive people, they will support you and encourage you, and they will be there to help you when you need it. This can be a huge help when you are trying to reach your goals, as it can be difficult to do it alone. With the support of others, you are more likely to succeed.
Benefits of Building Your Inner Circle: You have people to inspire and motivate you. You can talk openly about your thoughts, dreams, and problems without fear of judgment. You feel safe being yourself. You have trusted friends who can hold you accountable.
Positive people bring happiness into our lives, helping us become the best version of ourselves. In addition, studies show that close friendships can prevent loneliness and alleviate the effects of stress. Also, surrounding yourself with positive people can significantly impact your mood, mental health, and well-being.

06/06/23, 10:01 - Keith EWYL23E0120: I am a proud Edoofian
06/06/23, 10:01 - Jasmine Kaur:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, Let me share a small story with you!
 Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came. 
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.
The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell: 

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. 
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above  
06/06/23, 10:03 - Keith EWYL23E0120: So touchingüî•. Thank you Ms Jasmine for the moral boost this morning. I will work hard to brighten my future and to be successful.
07/06/23, 10:00 - Keith EWYL23E0120: I am a proud Edoofian

08/06/23, 16:41 - Jasmine Kaur: Good afternoon dear!

I hope this message finds you well and in high spirits. It's time for our session.
Let's make the most of this afternoon's session! Get ready to engage, ask questions, share your thoughts, and challenge yourselves to reach new heights. Remember, success is not measured solely by the outcome but by the effort, growth, and resilience you display along the way.

Let us start this session by going through your lesson. Were you able to complete the lesson?
08/06/23, 16:41 - Jasmine Kaur: That is great Keith. I must tell you that all this wait will be worth it.
08/06/23, 16:42 - Keith EWYL23E0120: I am still going through the lesson mam.

08/06/23, 16:50 - Jasmine Kaur: Complete the lesson dear and let me know all that you learn from the lesson.
08/06/23, 16:51 - Keith EWYL23E0120: Yes l am almost done. Let me quickly share it with you
08/06/23, 16:51 - Jasmine Kaur: Sjure
08/06/23, 17:12 - Keith EWYL23E0120: The most important lesson is to be adaptable and vigilant: always consider yourself in permanent beta, i.e. as a work in progress, eager to learn and develop. Prioritize learning opportunities. Too often, 20 years of experience really means one year of experience repeated 20 times.Taking intelligent risks requires tolerance and an expectation that education innovation includes both successful and unsuccessful endeavors. Intelligent risk-taking can be cultivated and supported by applying deliberate, thoughtful consideration to both the problem and its potential solutions.*Start-up of you*provides practical strategies to support its concepts, for example  people become entrepreneurs because When starting their own businesses, entrepreneurs are not motivated by what you may think. The main reason most people want to become their own boss is the freedom, satisfaction and flexibility it offers them. Entrepreneurs need to embrace new technology and use it to their benefit to continue growing their startups.
08/06/23, 17:15 - Jasmine Kaur: Let me read it.
08/06/23, 17:16 - Keith EWYL23E0120: Sure mam
08/06/23, 17:17 - Jasmine Kaur: It's great to see that you've grasped the important lesson of being adaptable and vigilant, considering yourself as a work in progress and being eager to learn and develop. Overall, you've highlighted important insights from the lesson, emphasizing the importance of continuous learning, adaptability, and intelligent risk-taking. Good Job Keith.
08/06/23, 17:18 - Keith EWYL23E0120: Thank you Ms Jasmineüòä
08/06/23, 17:33 - Jasmine Kaur: Welcome dear. So, now I would like to take an update about your progress in the EWYL projects.

08/06/23, 17:45 - Jasmine Kaur: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about

Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
08/06/23, 17:46 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe.
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5‚ÄôS which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5‚ÄôS of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

10/06/23, 13:43 - Keith EWYL23E0120: I have commented just now Ms Jasmine
10/06/23, 15:50 - Jasmine Kaur: SATURDAY ACTIVITY

Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?
This week‚Äôs Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better‚Äîtogether. It‚Äôs why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger‚Äîas successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.
As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.
Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.

Till then Happy Learning!
10/06/23, 15:50 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, I saw your comment keith

10/06/23, 16:28 - Keith EWYL23E0120: It's my greatest pleasure to share with you my story as an Edoofian. In English circles they say, "Success is the result of perfection, hard work, learning from failure, loyalty, and persistence. ". In order to be successful one has to endure from all the pain of failure which is one of my principles. As an Edoofian, my goal is not only of studying abroad but also to make sure that by the end of my academic years my community must be transformed into an inspirational community. Usually when people grow up they ought to forget that they were raised by the society. The society plays an important role in our upbringing and they make sure that wherever we go we will define the society in a positive manner. When l was a child l challenged myself that one day l will work hard to change my society, in my success story my society must be included. I was very impressed when l was enrolled in the Edoofa program. The program happened to match my goals with its objectives. When l heard of the EWYL program l told myself that this is the chance to create a story in my community. I am working much harder to better my society. I always say, "if l cannot do great things, l can do small things in a great way" hence l am motivating my fellow friends by telling them the good news about Edoofa program. I want to utilize this opportunity to make sure that all hardworking students in my community must be part of Edoofa. By doing this, majority of the parents are really excited as they can see the dreams of their own children coming true. I am finding it interesting in working on my projects because l can see my dream coming true and l will change my community for sure. Last but not least I will end up by saying, "The moment you believe you can't do it, everything else begins to crumble. Never stop believing..."
