25/07/22, 03:17 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

12/11/22, 17:45 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian,

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.

All your hard work and efforts are your assets and they should be used very wisely and in the right direction. But I feel from past some time that direction is missing. So I have planned that from now on we will direct all our efforts toward our projects. Our three constant projects are Company Connect, Community building, and School Connect. We should now focus on them completely. Now I want you to set your this week's targets for the projects so we can start working to achieve them.\\

I like to ponder a lot, and with it comes brainstorming, prototyping, and ideation techniques. How does the idea of meeting a CEO, knowing about their journey, and contemplating how success came to them sound? Interesting, right? Not yet?

Then perhaps you would like to know about how brands are developed, how they scale, how they flourish, and what goes into making a company from scratch to something of impeccable scale. In this webinar not only business ideations and strategies will be discussed but also brand development, moreover, our featured industry professional is profound in advertising, content marketing, and marketing research too. Who knows, something might catch your eye or let you discover your field of interest by just listening to the different structures of a company. I would genuinely implore you to give this a chance and see for yourself whether the seats we worth taking.

17/12/22, 20:13 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!
