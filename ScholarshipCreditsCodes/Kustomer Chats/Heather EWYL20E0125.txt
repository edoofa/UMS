12/07/22, 17:03 - Unknown: Good Morning, Heather
I hope that you are in good health and spirits
12/07/22, 21:19 - Unknown: It is time for our session now, Heather
12/07/22, 21:22 - Heather EWYL20E0125: Yes Sir it is
12/07/22, 21:27 - Unknown: Can we start now, Heather?
12/07/22, 21:41 - Heather EWYL20E0125: Yesss
12/07/22, 22:14 - Unknown: Heather, Can you tell me what did we discuss in our last session?
12/07/22, 22:18 - Heather EWYL20E0125: we discussed the Proud Edoofian ritual?
12/07/22, 22:20 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

I hope that you are good health and spirits
13/07/22, 16:58 - Unknown: I hope that you have gone through the above document?
13/07/22, 20:51 - Unknown: Are we connected, Heather?
25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
