20/07/22, 00:21 - Rumbidzai EWYL22E0293: Hello Mentor
20/07/22, 16:59 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr

20/07/22, 19:01 - Rumbidzai EWYL22E0293: I’m a proud Edoofian
20/07/22, 19:02 - Unknown: Greetings,
Today I wanted to discuss the recent message I shared with you. The message that we want to be our daily habit, our words of connecting and experiencing a sense of belonging, We all at team Edoofa are very thrilled as we personally are undertaking the same activity. May I know what have you understood from this message, what is the intention behind the same?
20/07/22, 19:03 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

All in all The passage pits self pity and pessimism as fertile ground for failure against the propensity to lay blame on others and the overt denial  to take full responsibility for this failure devoid of introspection, pure hard work and positivism.

08/08/22, 20:12 - Rumbidzai EWYL22E0293: Hello Mentor how are you 

Sorry for late replies my WhatsApp phone number was banned 
This is my task

Successful people always have a story to tell. They can provide an audit trail of their journey. This involves highlighting problems they encountered and how they managed to solve these. To successful people these are not obstacles but learning opportunities. Its a positive realization that success is not achieved through a set blue print but opportunities that need to be explored. The process might include challenges which to the ordinary person with no insight or perception might lead to the wrong perspective of  achieving success. Failure to plan is plan to fail according to Benjamin Franklins. It is never about other people or circumstances as pessimistic people would like to think,its about staying focused and having the ability to focus and being proactive. The ability to be successful is summed by Benjamin Franklin saying and I quote, “by failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail” (MBA Rendezvous, 2019). This is true because when goals are not set in life, the prospect for success tends to be slim. “Fail to prepare, prepare to fail” is a remarkable quote to help reiterate what is necessary to achieve any goal. 

This brings the ideas of perssimissim versus optimissism, positivism versus negativism. Positive energy is only experienced by hard working people whose limit is the sky. I feel motivated really taking all this into account and working on my short comings to achieve success and avoid the blame game.This gives me the impetus to explore and achieve my potential.

16/08/22, 19:49 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
How was your long weekend?

Let me educate you about the Indian independence day which was yesterday due to which we had a long weekend!
Independence Day, in India, is a national holiday celebrated annually on August 15. Independence Day marks the end of British rule in 1947 and the establishment of a free and independent Indian nation. It also marks the anniversary of the partition of the subcontinent into two countries, India and Pakistan, which occurred at midnight on August 14–15, 1947.

Isn’t this interesting?
16/08/22, 19:49 - Unknown: Can you tell me about one such national event in Africa?
16/08/22, 20:07 - Rumbidzai EWYL22E0293: Ok specifically in Zimbabwe Until roughly 2,000 years ago, what would become Zimbabwe was populated by ancestors of the San people. Bantu inhabitants of the region arrived and developed ceramic production in the area. A series of trading empires emerged, including the Kingdom of Mapungubwe and Kingdom of Zimbabwe. In the 1880s, the British South Africa Company began its activities in the region, leading to the colonial era in Southern Rhodesia.

Following the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979 there was a transition to internationally recognized majority rule in 1980. The United Kingdom granted Zimbabwe independence on 18 April that year. In the 2000s Zimbabwe's economy began to deteriorate due to various factors, including the imposition of economic sanctions by western countries led by the United Kingdom and widespread corruption in government. Economic instability caused many Zimbabweans to emigrate. Prior to its recognized independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, the nation had been known by several names: Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia and Zimbabwe Rhodesia.

Additionally, social learning is a very effective method of learning. You can learn from the mistakes and accomplishments of others, so you don't have to figure everything out on your own, for instance.

Your mentors will have a thorough discussion in our forthcoming session about what you think were the factors that led to the success of the three panellists listed here after you have carefully listened to the audio file and read the PDF.

13/01/23, 22:29 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
This is to inform you that  today  we celebrate a very prestigious festival in my religion: *Lohri*

The end of the winter season is a joyous one in India, with Lohri celebrated on January 13 annually. This is a special celebration, particularly in Northern India, that marks the harvest of the winter rabi crops and the end of the winter solstice. It celebrates the sun and the ushering in of longer days.
Do research about this festival and let me know whatever insight you gain.

27/01/23, 19:08 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
I hope you are doing well,

Yesterday, I was not able to take your session because yesterday on 26th January we celebrated the Indian Republic day. The significance of the day is to commemorate the Indian Constitution as the supreme law of the country and to honour the country's military and cultural legacy. Republic Day is also celebrated in state capitals and other cities across India, with parades, patriotic songs, and cultural performances.
