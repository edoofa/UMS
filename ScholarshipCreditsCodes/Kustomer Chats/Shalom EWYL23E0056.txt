01/05/23, 18:19 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
01/05/23, 18:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
01/05/23, 18:20 - Saloni Rastogi: I have kept your session day and timings as:

*TUESDAY AND FRIDAY*
from
*02:00-03:30 PM*
01/05/23, 18:28 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
01/05/23, 20:27 - Shalom EWYL23E0056: Yes I am ready
02/05/23, 18:35 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Shalom!
How are you?
02/05/23, 18:37 - Saloni Rastogi: Please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' .
May I know which project will you work on in May?
02/05/23, 19:49 - Shalom EWYL23E0056: I am a proud Edoofian
02/05/23, 19:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.

Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell:

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges.
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
 3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
02/05/23, 19:49 - Shalom EWYL23E0056: Community building project
02/05/23, 21:14 - Shalom EWYL23E0056: Thank you
03/05/23, 16:37 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Shalom!
How are you?
03/05/23, 16:40 - Saloni Rastogi: Please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'.
Also, since you chose Community building project, let me share with you how my bright students have been working on it.
03/05/23, 16:40 - Saloni Rastogi: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*

For eg: In your case, it will be-

*Shalom/Saloni/3MAY2023*
03/05/23, 16:41 - Saloni Rastogi: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
03/05/23, 16:41 - Saloni Rastogi: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
03/05/23, 16:41 - Saloni Rastogi: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
03/05/23, 16:41 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
03/05/23, 16:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you form the group, please let me know.
05/05/23, 11:08 - Shalom EWYL23E0056: I am a proud Edoofian
05/05/23, 11:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Dear Proud Edoofian,

I hope you are doing well. This message serves as a gentle reminder for your Wednesday lesson. It is important to continue learning and developing your skills in order to advance in your career. Please take some time to go through the lesson, take notes on any important information, and complete the assigned tasks. Remember, investing in yourself is always a wise decision.

Happy learning!
05/05/23, 11:12 - Shalom EWYL23E0056: Thank you
05/05/23, 17:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Shalom, can you please share your views on the Wednesday lesson and project update?

06/05/23, 10:24 - Shalom EWYL23E0056: How to think better is a skill we've never been taught and it's a skill that gives one the ability to critically think through a problem and make good decisions in regards to the problem.

Multitasking can produce the worst results as it is a result of not being organized.Writing also helps one to slow down and think.


Therefore,in regards to the project I have learnt that tackling one project at a time prevents multitasking which breed bad results and also writing down the important details is quite important

09/05/23, 18:40 - Saloni Rastogi: Excellent response on the Wednesday wisdom! You've highlighted the importance of thinking better as a valuable skill that is often overlooked. Your understanding that critical thinking leads to making good decisions demonstrates your awareness of the power of thoughtful analysis. It's great that you recognize the drawbacks of multitasking and the benefits of focusing on one project at a time. Additionally, acknowledging the value of writing to slow down and organize thoughts shows your insightful approach. Keep up the fantastic work in honing your thinking skills and applying them effectively to your projects!

How are you doing?
In our session today we will discuss how adaptability can be mind-boggling and how necessary it is for all of us>
So in our session please share your views on the same and updates on the projects.
03/08/23, 16:05 - Shalom EWYL23E0056: Okay
03/08/23, 16:20 - Shalom EWYL23E0056: As much as adaptability is bewildering it it crucial to one's survival in a new area.One has to get used to the cultures,the social norms and values of that particular area so as to blend in and to avoid self isolation.For one to also get used to a new place they need to be flexible enough to interact with the people who have been in the area for quite some time and thus it will be easy for them to survive without feeling alienated.

In the Community Building project,it is very important to make sure a person is ductile so that when they get a chance to study in India they are safe and not prone to self isolation.
03/08/23, 16:33 - Saloni Rastogi: Shalom, your adaptability and flexibility are truly commendable traits that will serve you well in the Community Building project, especially as you embark on the journey of studying in India. Embracing the cultures, social norms, and values of a new place is not only crucial for survival but also for fostering meaningful connections with the people around you.
03/08/23, 16:34 - Saloni Rastogi: Your willingness to blend in and interact with those who have been in the area for some time will undoubtedly help you avoid feelings of alienation and self-isolation. By being ductile and open-minded, you create opportunities for positive experiences and personal growth.
03/08/23, 18:12 - Shalom EWYL23E0056: Indeed Ms Saloni

Through this lesson, I learned that Video blogging, or vlogging, has transformed how we share stories and insights. With just a camera and a creative mind, individuals can transport audiences into their world, adding a visual and personal touch to their narratives. Vlogging blends entertainment, education, and authenticity, allowing creators to connect with viewers on a deeper level. From travel escapades to cooking tutorials, vlogging's dynamic nature captures attention, fostering a sense of community and fostering a global conversation through the power of visual storytelling.
In this session, I want to learn what all you grasped about *VIDEO BLOGGING* and yes, *PROJECT UPDATES*
