15/07/22, 17:45 - Blessing EWYL21E0906: Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe was born  in South Africa . His father,\r
Augustine, was first a school teacher, before starting a mini-store.\r
From his dad’s small foray into entrepreneurship, Patrice Motsepe got his first exposure to the business world and\r
understood the mining business.\r
He acquired this knowledge when helping his father sell liquor to mine workers always coming to their Spaza shop.\r
This group of men usually stormed his father’s shop every day to first buy and drink liquor before heading to the\r
mines to work.\r
Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe studied and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Swaziland, then\r
subsequently earned a law degree from the University of the Witwatersrand.

Patrice Motsepe specialized in mining and business law. His exposure to the sector caused him\r
to start a company which was into contract mining services that involved\r
creating a system of worker remuneration that integrated a low base salary with a profit-sharing bonus, and also the\r
cleaning of gold dust from inside mine shafts for the Vaal Reefs Gold mine, currently a subsidiary of AngloGold. The company's name was Future mining.

Thats how he became Rich. He also done ted half of his salary to Charity. He was also rewarded 250million Dollars.

He has a Very Remarkable story  showing how Hard work, perseverance, and\r
being curious can make actually make a person Rich, I would like to be like him someday.

20/07/22, 07:21 - Blessing EWYL21E0906: I did a reseach on the internet and found out that the Gold mining Industry  in our country Zimbabwe has been going on from ancient times and it is estimated that a third about 700 tonnes of all historical gold production was mined locally from the seventh century until the introduction of mechanized mining. There are over 4000 recorded god deposits, nearly all of them located on ancient workings.

The occurrence of gold in Zimbabwe is mainly confined to hydrothermal vein and shear zone deposits found exclusively in rocks of the Basement Complex age.

 From my perception production from outside the Zimbabwe craton has been Renco Mine, which is in ancient deformed, high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Archean age North Marginal Zone of the Limpopo Mobile Belt and a number of mines in the Proterozoic Piriwiri.

Blanket Goldmine is a well established Gold Mine in Zimbabwe and arcording to my research from the Internet it is operated at 750meters  depth below the Surface 

I think as long as there are going to be miner volcanic eruptions the Gold with still be coming of(thats my Prediction)

As August Intake is right at our doorsteps, So due to this many of our Edoofians will be arriving here in India to kick start their dream journey.?

I feel that it is my duty to make sure that the university has prepared well for their onboarding process.

This is why I would be visiting the universities Today in order to do a personal check up.
Since, This process would take up lots of time that is why we won't be able to connect Today.
However, I am sure that in my absence, You will make sure that you follow the below given things:

1. Make sure to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual at 9 AM Tomorrow.
2. Do submit the Wednesday Lesson before the deadline.

Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!
