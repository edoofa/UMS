21/10/23, 13:50 - Christina EWYL23E0761: Thank you once more
21/10/23, 14:32 - Christina EWYL23E0761: I was in a shop full of dresses and beautiful jewellery and also such dresses were the latest designs. In the shop honour was mine and beauty as well I had,my body covered in the appetising perfume and around me there were smart ladies ready to pick what I chose.

I was addressed with the most highly title,but to be frank my experience was too beautiful to exist. At a corner in the shop I saw a splendid dress which at that point took my breath away, as such I never thought twice about the dress but pointed out to it ,but just when I was about to be handed the dress my life was lost and I woke up from that fantasising dream and saw that I was too poor to buy soap.

I dropped a tear and thought to myself"where could I get such fortune to buy such a dress if I'm failing to get bread for my hungry stomach." But my thoughts were disturbed by a person who reminded me of the task I have to carry out, I was supposed to feed 150 pigs and sell eggs at a certain farm.

But that day I carried out my task before noon for I wanted to rest and continue the delightful dream I had. But surprisingly my friend mentioned about an artistic festival and considered me to take part for I had an amazing knitting skill,but thinking about it I wanted to take my chance.

On the day of the festival I gathered my shameful clothes and looked like a pity human. There several rich people carried out their amazing crafts and suddenly a man reminded me to gather what I can do best and work on it. 

Without wondering my eyes  I worked on my knitted dress and developed a gorgeous and attractive dress, a rich lady saw my dress and suggested it would be a masterpiece in her collection but I thought she was only saying delightful sentences.

She took me and introduced me to a shop similar to that one in my dream and whispered to my ear "I give you a chance to pick out a dress you would like to have and also you will be considered to be my designers ",upon hearing that my eyes rushed to the same corner I saw in my dreams only to recognise a different dress but much expensive than the one in my dream. I pointed out to it and she guaranteed me the opportunity to run her shop for my dress demonstrated my hard work.

At that point I took my crochet and started knitting the best I could, and my life was never the same.

28/10/23, 13:27 - Christina EWYL23E0761: Oh thank
28/10/23, 13:27 - Christina EWYL23E0761: Thank you
28/10/23, 13:47 - Christina EWYL23E0761: My father is a pastor,but before starting this career he passed through alot.
My father is the last born in his family and he was raised in the village where situations were not conducive for learning,good diet as well as financial stability,but instead of backing down my father was his own empowerment,for he would wake up early in the morning and start farming after farming he would start preparing porridge for himself. Once the porridge is done he would feed on it then walk a long distance to acquire education ,but at school he always kept in mind that he wants to change the situation of his life. Reaching secondary school his parents had not much to support his studies,hence he didn't want to accept reality but rather he gathered his belongings and set for the city of Blantyre. In Blantyre he started working at southern bottlers so as to get money to pay for his school fees,this worked out and he finished school and started working at leopard match as an electrician,and later on married my mother and had us as their children. At some point he thought of pursuing a different career,that of a pastor and he changed careers now he's a well known past named Rev Hastings Phale.
28/10/23, 14:00 - Jasmine Kaur: Your father's journey is not only a source of inspiration but also a reminder that with determination and the right mindset, individuals can achieve their dreams and make a meaningful impact on the world. Thank you for sharing this incredible story of resilience and success.
