25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

He has comprehensive experience in areas such as interactive print, packaging, copywriting, and design. He says the one thing he wishes he had known sooner was, ‘sometimes when an idea is still at birth, not many will see it the way you do but you have to believe in it yourself. He also highlights that the best business decision you can ever make is hiring the right people.
So in our session today, we will discuss:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom

08/08/22, 03:42 - Chirenje EWYL22E0194: *The secret of  Gilberts success and identifying the traits that made him successful* 

Firstly l can say his first step to his success was because I'd how he was raised.The fact that he was raised by her single mother made hunger for his success . Secondly since he was comprehensive in areas such as interactive print, packaging , copywriting and so forth this oaged a way also for his success since he could these kind of things for himself and also others.The thing that he was a lover of Graphic Design this made him not to give up on her dream even though he faced many hardship he would try harder cause it was his dream.What also made him successful was his girlfriend  because  his girlfriend gave him one hundred and sixty united dollars o that he can use for office space rentals .The other thing was that he also found people who had the same energy of working like him henceforth this made him and others also to became successful 

To summarize the fact that Gilbert never gave up on his dream even though what people told him he never seize to give up on this dream but rather to pursue harder
08/08/22, 18:39 - Unknown: Greetings Chirenje!
How did your weekend go?
08/08/22, 18:41 - Unknown: I see you have typed two, may I know what confusion are you facing as to who and what a proud edoofian denotes?
Let me bring some clarity on the same.
08/08/22, 18:41 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
08/08/22, 18:41 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
08/08/22, 18:45 - Unknown: I know we have both been connected in the EWYL Journey for a long time now and I very well know how dedicatedly and consistently you work and make every session's discussion very productive and interactive. 
This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

SESSIONS' DAYS- I know you are very well aware that your sessions are scheduled on MONDAY and THURSDAY on the EWYL Line from 04:30-06:00 PM

MISSED SESSION- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday.In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday. 
Sessions will be held only on the EWYL Line.
Keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line.
In cases where you are not able to attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
Hoping for an amazing week with you.?
08/08/22, 22:16 - Unknown: So, in our session today:
1. discuss your understanding of the weekend activity.
2. make weekly plans on three ongoing projects.
08/08/22, 22:17 - Unknown: I read your response Chirenje and I must say that like always your understanding has blown my mind and added so much to my knowledge that I can't express.
All I can say is that:
*Success* is a strong word with a deep meaning, which might vary from one person to another. To attain success or your life’s objective, you must work tirelessly. Your success determines the _type of person you must be and the lifestyle you must keep_. There is no worth and no achievement if a person has dreams but does nothing to pursue them. A person can achieve success if they are committed to their objectives and dare to confront any challenges that come on their way to success. For some, success entails a large sum of money. However, the accurate measure of success is realizing your dream and attaining your objective. A person who aspires to be a doctor can only accomplish it if he puts in the necessary effort and works hard. If only he knew which road to take and how to get started on it. There is no such thing as a quick fix for success. You must pursue the route of honesty, truthfulness, and strenuous effort to be successful. The road to success is never easy, and there are no shortcuts. *Finding a solution to any problem may take time and a lot of effort, but there is always a solution; we only need to seek in the proper direction. A person must overcome all of the obstacles while remaining strong enough to proceed along the path. *If you give up on the struggles, then you can never achieve your dreams.*
08/08/22, 22:47 - Chirenje EWYL22E0194: Oky thank you Ms

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

How's your day going?

Every habit helps to enhance the other. When even just one habit is implemented the output will be great. As we all strive toward bettering ourselves we should take into consideration the eleven habits of success.

23/08/22, 07:43 - Unknown: Greetings Our Proud Edoofian! 

Your attendance at the webinar with Mr. Simon Maingi was greatly appreciated. You certainly had a lot of information to take in. Many kids attended, and the majority of them spoke with Mr. Simon personally to discover the value of developing a \"YOU\" brand. 

There is clearly room for improvement in terms of asking the correct questions, proper webcam etiquette, and engagement, all of which will be the subject of numerous talks going forward.

In the interim, we've provided a link to the session's feedback form. Your truthful feedback will enable us to contact the industry experts of your choosing and publish more success stories that will enable you to develop your skill set and advance your career.

25/08/22, 17:53 - Unknown: The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known to suffer, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of those depths.
The three said sharing their stories should inspire youths to work hard toward achieving their goals and shun a life of drugs.
This lesson was something that added so much to my knowledge and yes, took me one step ahead in this stage of learning:
So in our session today, we will:
1. talk about how these three brains inspired you
2. discussion on the community building project ( I will share audio and a revised form with you, please go through it, and then we will discuss it)

I want our conversations to be more interactive.
13/10/22, 01:13 - Unknown: I hope you are there with me.
13/10/22, 01:13 - Unknown: We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real-life example. That is how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because in the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.
Responses will be submitted on the EWYL Line only.

Happy Learning.

Made me happy that you explained everything so elaborately.
14/10/22, 23:07 - Unknown: And as for the Wednesday lesson, I completely agree with you. The point where you said 'Even though he lacks resources, he never made a shortcut and also never gave up on his dream', I got taken away by it.
The lesson was an important platform to make us realize the importance of social media Chirenje. Through these platforms, like Instagram, Facebook, Youtube, LinkedIn, etc, we can shape our careers and profile, like the example shared in the lesson.
14/10/22, 23:09 - Unknown: Along with this, I have come up with a brilliant opportunity for you Chirenje.
This is an amazing and exciting time for you to become the **face of the EDOOFA SCHOLARSHIP Program.**
So, Ms. Deepali, Head of Team EWYL, and I, your proud mentor, have prepared this opportunity to show the face of our dedicated students on Edoofa's social media platforms.

What all you have to do for this:
-you have to speak about *Process of Payment*
# in the video you have to speak about the _Clarity about financial preparation_-  how students need to be honest with their counselors about their payment plans since they guide them in the right direction and help you so that it's not a burden on you.

- The video has to be made professionally: wear a shirt, have a decent background, and have a stable camera.

- the video has to be about 60-90 seconds long.

- *DEADLINE: SUNDAY (that is the day after tomorrow), 12 PM*

20/10/22, 21:01 - Unknown: I am happy to tell you that this weekend we are having our great Indian festival, Deepawali and you know this festival holds a special place in the hearts of all Indian families. So yesterday, everyone in our office wore Ethnic dresses and celebrate Deepawali's party where we exchanged gifts and lit up the office with diyas and candles.
Due to this, there was a delay in sending you the Wednesday lesson for this week.
Please see to it and we will have a session tomorrow on the same because I want to give you time to ponder and work on it.
20/10/22, 21:01 - Unknown: In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.
20/10/22, 21:55 - Chirenje EWYL22E0194: Happy Deepawali Ms

He was born in a small village and his passion for football ,but his father never supported him because  they were not that famous  .He said he had to be hungry and run to achieve  his dream 

He said  that materialistic  life should  not be rushed for but rather focus on using resources  to build  ourselves  and other around us who dont have such opportunities  .When he visited his village during  the Pandemic  he build  hospitals  and brought  ventilation  henceforth  the phrase \"Humility is a virtue \"


2. Deepawali is the festival  that holds a special place in the all Indian families. During Deepawali everyone  dresses  in Ethnic  dresses  .A party is also done whereby people  exchange gifts  and lit up the office  white diyas and candle's
22/10/22, 06:11 - Unknown: Very well Chirenje.
22/10/22, 06:12 - Unknown: I read your response Chirenje and I feel that the struggle exists to change us and our lives we struggle because it is the key to the path of our destination of what we want or what we want to become filled with challenges, knowledge, and so on. Without struggle, we humans won't be able to achieve what we have today.
We both have spoken on similar grounds and yes it was indeed a very inspiring tale.
22/10/22, 06:12 - Unknown: Yes, that's great Chirenje.
It is a Hindu festival that marks the grand welcome of Lord Rama his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after long battle and hardships.
Moreover, the bigger significance that this festival taught me as a student and I want to teach you as well is that it marks the birth of a better version of ourselves, this day brings motivation to us to fight the evil in us and work for the best. It says aloud that, 'work hard, and struggle to strive for the good'.
Being your mentor, I want you to realize that you are made to do much bigger things in life and aim high. I want that you set aims in your life and work hard to achieve them.
Tell me, will you promise me that?
22/10/22, 11:33 - Chirenje EWYL22E0194: Yes Ms I promise

27/10/22, 06:58 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
