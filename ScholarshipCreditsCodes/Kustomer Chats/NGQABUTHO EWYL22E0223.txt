14/07/22, 20:58 - NGQABUTHO EWYL22E0223: Good day
14/07/22, 21:00 - Unknown: Good Day Ngqabutho!
14/07/22, 21:01 - Unknown: Okay So I am sharing a document with you that I sent earlier also. Have a look at it and give me a brief summary of the same.
14/07/22, 21:01 - NGQABUTHO EWYL22E0223: Ok ma'am
14/07/22, 21:19 - Unknown: Please have a look at this and let me know your understanding on the same.
14/07/22, 21:28 - NGQABUTHO EWYL22E0223: The document shares the projects and their worth.
It also shared the corresponding credits from the activities.

I'll give an understanding of the first project.
14/07/22, 21:45 - Unknown: That's amazing Ngqabutho.
14/07/22, 21:45 - Unknown: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
14/07/22, 22:04 - NGQABUTHO EWYL22E0223: Im done listening to it
14/07/22, 22:05 - NGQABUTHO EWYL22E0223: This is what I understood:

The goal is to create a cooperate alliance between Edoofa and the companies and potential employers concerned. As a representative of Edoofa I must build a network of partner companies and potential employers. This exercise helps or aims to prepare me for the market that I'm going to be working in and hence the need to understand it and familiarize myself with it at an early stage.

Reaching out to these organizations on behalf of Edoofa can also lead getting an online project that helps me and my community's growth. It also gives one leverage and credibility and a sense of confidence towards job hunting in the future as I prepare to speak with head dignitaries at an early stage.
14/07/22, 23:24 - NGQABUTHO EWYL22E0223: My question is how will you keep track of my progress of the activities...

I'm already doing the research on companies and their employees and dignitaries
15/07/22, 00:50 - Unknown: Yes Ngqabutho. I will keep a track of everything, don't worry.
15/07/22, 00:51 - Unknown: For TODAY, we will discuss project 1. Tomorrow we will discuss project 2 and then similarly project 3.
15/07/22, 00:52 - Unknown: So, now- I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
15/07/22, 01:04 - Unknown: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
15/07/22, 01:04 - NGQABUTHO EWYL22E0223: Ok ma'am let me go through it
15/07/22, 23:26 - Unknown: Greetings Ngqabutho!

15/07/22, 23:41 - NGQABUTHO EWYL22E0223: Greetings to you too.
M day is fine and good thank you.
15/07/22, 23:44 - NGQABUTHO EWYL22E0223: I have downloaded the linkedin application and I'm to set up my account.

Network issues sometimes hinder my progress with assignments that require an internet connection.
That also goes for my Isaac videos. Internet connection is required and sometimes it does not connect. But I promise to deliver all the videos at once, as soon as I get a full internet connection
16/07/22, 00:42 - NGQABUTHO EWYL22E0223: This below is my Wednesday Wisdom response
16/07/22, 00:42 - NGQABUTHO EWYL22E0223: Patrice Motsepe was not born with a lot of money or entitlement or a lot of opportunities for that matter but through hard work and a determined vision, he went on to become a billionaire through a start up mining business. 
He was the son of a teacher. And through the Little opportunities he got he maximized them and for the best out them to push him forward with his vision.
The intriguing part about his life is his attainment of a Law degree at the University of Witwatersrand and his LLB in 1998 leading to his stand in one of the most reputable law firms in South Africa. With this small opportunity he makes a mark big enough to get attention to pull him into the big leads hence we see him under the American Bar Association in 1991 and moving to work as a visiting attorney of Mcguire Woods in Richmond, Virginia. 

This is where he starts to show the vision, his zeal to want to be in the mining business.He reads articles about his to-be-trade and handles business and mining cases. He is drawn even more by the experience of meeting with mining organizations and the likes and thus the minute a chance shows up he starts up a mining firm and this show of  passion and zeal later on grows Into more.
He Is self made and   started small.
Started by helping at a spaza shop and just didn't give up: using law to kick start his vision for business. Becoming a partner and saving enough to earn an negotiation with Bobby Godsell when yet another opportunity presented itself and his charisma and work ethic and zeal for mining business, his passion earns him a spot in the big leagues of a dying and unprofitable mining shaft.

This part is one that interests me the most:
While he sees the unprofitable mining shaft, he takes it and somehow shows greater thinking business wise towards rejuvenation of it. He manages to raise up the mining shaft by making thoughtful decisions, going small to go big. He's reduction of staff and everything else manages to build the comp

16/07/22, 04:37 - Unknown: I read your response to the Wednesday wisdom NGQABUTHO and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a WAY. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. We can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.

25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
