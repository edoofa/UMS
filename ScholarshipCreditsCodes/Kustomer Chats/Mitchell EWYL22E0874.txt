I like to ponder a lot, and with it comes brainstorming, prototyping, and ideation techniques. How does the idea of meeting a CEO, knowing about their journey, and contemplating how success came to them sound? Interesting, right? Not yet?

Then perhaps you would like to know about how brands are developed, how they scale, how they flourish, and what goes into making a company from scratch to something of impeccable scale. In this webinar not only business ideations and strategies will be discussed but also brand development, moreover, our featured industry professional is profound in advertising, content marketing, and marketing research too. Who knows, something might catch your eye or let you discover your field of interest by just listening to the different structures of a company. I would genuinely implore you to give this a chance and see for yourself whether the seats we worth taking.

17/12/22, 20:16 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!

I really wish to be my grandmother's secret Santa. You know I'm still a school student I'm not working yet, so I don't have money to buy her fancy gifts, but this does not stop me from being her secret Santa. From the deepest part of my heart I will make an album containing all my photos with her from since my childhood. I want to show her that I value our memories together and I want to show her that she means a lot to me. I want to remind her that she will always be in my heart. I will also write a letter and put it inside the gift box along with the photo album. In the letter I will pour my heart to her appreciating everything she had done for me since my childhood.

Everybody in the world anticipates this time of year. Some of our students who are now studying in India recently connected with Ms. Davi, and they talked about how they celebrated Christmas back home.⛪️?☃️

I am eager to learn how you want to ring in the new year and enjoy Christmas this year❄️????
Please share with me your favourite Christmas time memories, any associated images, and any traditions you follow. This will undoubtedly be a very interesting discussion.

Wish you a joyous time ahead??❄️

22/12/22, 00:35 - Mitchell EWYL22E0874: I'm not going to talk about how Christmas is celebrated in Zimbabwe because I will spent the whole day since different families sometimes celebrate Christmas in many different ways. So my dear Mentor I'm going to tell you how my family celebrates Christmas.
22/12/22, 00:35 - Mitchell EWYL22E0874: During Christmas and New Year more than three quarters of our relatives come to our home to spent the holiday. Most of the time my dad stays in South Africa since it is where he works. Towards Christmas he comes home along with his younger brother and his family, also along with his 2 sisters and their children. I also have an aunt who stays in another town called Inyanga which is the largest mountain in Zimbabwe aslo comes to our home with her 4 daughters and 3 grandchildren. Other relatives from my mom's side also come to our home for celebration. On the Christmas day itself most of my dad's friends come to our home with their families for celebration. Towards Christmas my mom goes to South Africa to buy new clothes and shoes for us to wear on Christmas and New Year's day and also more food for people to eat. We don't usually go to other people's homes or to our relatives but they come to our home since our yard is very large to accommodate a lot of people. We usually kill a cow or many goats and many chickens for the celebration. The celebration starts on the night before the Christmas day. The relatives return to their homes after New Year. We usually pray before starting the celebration.

The feedback we have received from some of you on this week’s Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.
As part of this week’s Saturday Activity, you are required to share your written submission on : 
What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?
There is no word limit, so feel free to express your understanding in detail. The second answer requires some mental work, so sit with yourself, introspect, and share your honest answer with your mentor. 
Let this activity play an important role in your personal goal setting. We will connect soon in our upcoming session.

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!","transform":"

22/03/23, 22:57 - Unknown: The concept of wealth has been a topic of much debate and discussion for centuries. While some view wealth as a means to achieve success and fulfillment, others may view it with suspicion or even disdain. However, it is important to understand that ethical wealth creation is possible and can be a force for good in the world. In this regard, it is essential to examine our own perspectives on wealth creation, and consider how they may impact our relationship with money, status, and success.","transform":"
