05/12/23, 15:41 - Ananya: Good afternoon, Kaunda!

Here's a fun and easy fact to brighten your day: Honeybees can recognize human faces! These tiny creatures have an amazing ability to remember and distinguish between different human faces. So, the next time you see a bee buzzing around, maybe it's just saying, "Hello!"üêù
05/12/23, 15:48 - Kaunda EWYL23E0753: Noted ma'am even though I don't like Bees
05/12/23, 15:58 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey.
I want you to go through these points quickly.
I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.

It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.

Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.

05/12/23, 16:14 - Kaunda EWYL23E0753: The community building cause it allowed me to improve on my communication skills and its allowed me to be more social,it has also allowed me to take a risk.

05/12/23, 16:47 - Kaunda EWYL23E0753: For the school connection there some tiny bumps like it's a little bit difficult to connect with the school
05/12/23, 16:48 - Kaunda EWYL23E0753: But for the community building I help out in some local areas around my neighbourhood
05/12/23, 16:51 - Ananya: So, do you have a community building group?
05/12/23, 17:32 - Kaunda EWYL23E0753: No

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into ‚Äì the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work ‚Äì a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.üåü

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.ü§ù

15/12/23, 15:38 - Ananya: Good afternoon, kaunda!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!
Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!üçìü´ê
15/12/23, 16:54 - Kaunda EWYL23E0753: Yes ma'am
15/12/23, 17:21 - Ananya: Well, I had a fantastic session planned for you this week, but I noticed were not here. We only connect twice a week, and that's just for one and a half hours each time. It's disheartening to see this irresponsible attitude towards the session.
I hope this won't happen again, and we can continue our session next time. Please don't miss your EWYL Ritual this time, as we'll be meeting again on Tuesday!
15/12/23, 17:43 - Kaunda EWYL23E0753: Sorry ma'am I had some personal matters to deal with it won't happen again.

Did you know that the tradition of hanging stockings by the fireplace comes from the legend of St. Nicholas? According to the story, St. Nicholas dropped gold coins down the chimney of a poor man's house, and they landed in the stockings that were hanging by the fire to dry. From then on, the tradition stuck, and now many of us hang stockings as part of our Christmas celebrations. üß¶‚ú®

Today's Wednesday Wisdom is not just special but carries a powerful reminder of the true essence of Christmas. As we stand on the brink of the festive season, it's crucial to reflect on the values that unite us as a community.

Beyond the glittering lights and festive decorations, Christmas serves as a poignant reminder of the core values that bind humanity together. It's a time when love, compassion, and generosity take center stage, fostering a sense of togetherness and shared joy.

Let's take a moment today to embrace the spirit of Christmas, appreciating the significance of our connections with one another. The lessons learned during this festive season go beyond the celebration itself, leaving a lasting impact on the way we interact with those around us.

May this Wednesday Wisdom inspire you to carry the spirit of Christmas not just during the holiday season but throughout the year! üéÑ‚ú®

Wishing you a joyous and reflective Wednesday!

Warm regards,

22/12/23, 16:03 - Ananya: Well, since we started our session with Christmas, it reminds me of our Wednesday lesson. Did you read it?
22/12/23, 16:04 - Kaunda EWYL23E0753: Yes ma'am
22/12/23, 16:06 - Ananya: That's great! What did you learn from it? Kindly share your understanding with me.
22/12/23, 16:10 - Kaunda EWYL23E0753: The Wednesday wisdom 
Talks about Christmas and what is the whole meaning of Christmas, it also talks about how Christmas but even though it maybe different the essence of Christmas will still be the same,mean the spirit of love
22/12/23, 16:12 - Ananya: Now, 2023 is wrapping up. Don't you think we should kick off the new year with something big? How about committing to earning a specific amount of scholarship credits?
After all, you wouldn't want to head to India empty-handed.

I'm saying this from my own experience ‚Äì having some credits before you arrive in India isn't just a benefit for you; it's a help for your parents too. Not only this, we often pick students for internships and personal training based on their credits and regularity in the EWYL journey.
Believe me, you've got plenty of time right now being in your home country, so don;t you think we should utilise this time with our utmost dedication?
22/12/23, 16:15 - Kaunda EWYL23E0753: Yes ma'am
22/12/23, 16:27 - Ananya: Great, so I have finalized a few of my students for a 30-day challenge. During this duration I want you to dedicatedly attend the sessions and work hard on your EWYL Projects.
Not only this, I will set a target for you and you have to commit to work hard to achieve those targets. Being your mentor I will be there to help you in each process. I that alright?
22/12/23, 16:29 - Kaunda EWYL23E0753: Yes and thank you ma'am
22/12/23, 16:35 - Ananya: Amazing! Let's set a new target for you. For the first 10 days out of the 30, I want you to focus on connecting with two schools and getting eight students to submit their offline application forms.

If you encounter any challenges during this time, reach out to me immediately because we need to achieve this target. I expect you to give it your best effort.
22/12/23, 16:38 - Kaunda EWYL23E0753: Yes ma'am
22/12/23, 16:42 - Ananya: So, Kaunda, do you have any plans for how you would work on these targets?
22/12/23, 16:52 - Kaunda EWYL23E0753: For the schools it will be tricky cause majority of them have closed so I will use my friends instead
22/12/23, 17:01 - Ananya: That's alright. However, for the other project, you can use the following way :

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
22/12/23, 17:01 - Ananya: *Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
22/12/23, 17:42 - Ananya: Alright, your time starts now! Start exploring and working so that you can submit at least 2 application forms with me by tomorrow! Utilize the weekend. Now, let us conclude our session here, and we shall reconnect on Tuesday. Make sure to follow your EWYL ritual tomorrow, as I will be sharing your weekend activity.
