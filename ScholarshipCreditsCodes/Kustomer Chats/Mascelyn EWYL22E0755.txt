How are you?
04/10/23, 15:24 - Saloni Rastogi: Before we begin, as you have come on the EWYL Line, you have already completed some basic formalities. Now, I would like to talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.

I kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let me know.
04/10/23, 19:11 - Mascelyn EWYL22E0755: If the student is unavaible, will the sessions be resumed after she will be available.I'm worried.
