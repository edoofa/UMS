05/01/24, 13:12 - Ananya: Good morning, George!

 Every day is a new beginning, take a deep breath and start afresh. On this note, let us begin our session and make a change together! ‚òÄÔ∏èüåº
05/01/24, 13:13 - George EWYL23E1028: Okay great let's proceed
05/01/24, 13:18 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
05/01/24, 13:19 - George EWYL23E1028: Okay noted thank you l'm also excited about this journey
05/01/24, 13:23 - Ananya: Well, I believe that we should begin with something that aligns with your interests. So would you like to share which one is your favorite project? The community building or the school reform?
05/01/24, 13:24 - George EWYL23E1028: I can say both but the school reform is my favorite for now
05/01/24, 13:25 - Ananya: Great! So for today, we will be discussing our third project which is the school reform mission. I will share a few tips and tricks for it! Are you ready?
05/01/24, 13:25 - George EWYL23E1028: Yes yes ready!
05/01/24, 13:33 - Ananya: Alright, So, there are two ways to work on the African School Reform project:


A. *Connecting with school virtually*-
‚ñ™Ô∏è In this you would have to find the contacts of the schools through your peers, friends, neighbors, cousins, school teachers, and school heads.
‚ñ™Ô∏èThen introduce yourself to them professionally and state the purpose of connecting with them along with their available time.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share information about Edoofa that I will be providing you in order to help them understand the Program deeply and with more clarity.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share the school form with them, and if they are interested in connecting with us, then our aim should be to get the form filled.
05/01/24, 13:34 - George EWYL23E1028: Okay noted and l have managed to connect with two school heads so far and waiting for time to schedule our sessions
05/01/24, 13:39 - Ananya: Alright, George! B. *Visiting schools physically*

‚ñ™Ô∏è Now by this, as it clearly says, you have to visit schools nearby and inform them about Edoofa.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Visiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏è With this, you will surely gain a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, overcome the fear of presenting yourself and your family Edoofa, spontaneously in front of anyone at any point.
05/01/24, 13:40 - George EWYL23E1028: Yes l would love this one
05/01/24, 13:45 - Ananya: B. *Visiting schools physically*

‚ñ™Ô∏è Now by this, as it clearly says, you have to visit schools nearby and inform them about Edoofa.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Visiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏è With this, you will surely gain a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, overcome the fear of presenting yourself and your family Edoofa, spontaneously in front of anyone at any point.
05/01/24, 13:45 - George EWYL23E1028: Hie my mentor l have connected with one school head from Bradley High School in Mashonaland Central and he has scheduled me for 12:00 sharp
05/01/24, 13:45 - George EWYL23E1028: Noted thank you
05/01/24, 13:50 - Ananya: Alright, George! Let me share some important resources with you that you can share with the School Head.
05/01/24, 13:51 - Ananya: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!üéâ
05/01/24, 13:51 - Ananya: Edoofa is a *social-for-profit organization* that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities‚ú®.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!
05/01/24, 13:51 - Ananya: Edoofa scholarship program is currently helping over *100 schools in Africa*, and over *3000 African students* are benefiting from our scholarship program. The school principals and teachers who are playing a significant role in our program are enjoying exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Now, to help the students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation, Edoofa has its own Earn While You Learn Program, which helps the students to learn skills and earn money in the form of scholarship credits to reduce their expenses.üôå
05/01/24, 13:51 - Ananya: _Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today‚Äôs industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country‚Äôs development/growth._
05/01/24, 13:51 - Ananya: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

Their associate partner, *Mr. Shorwi Kawadza* is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of *Hartzell High School*. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with them for the past *Four Years* from which more than _80 students_ have enrolled and arrived in India already.
05/01/24, 13:52 - Ananya: The Child of the *DEO, Manicaland* Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
_*United College of Education*_, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and _Respected Sir Adam Luthuli_ has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program.


Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, _*Headmaster of Chibuwe High*_, the son of Ms. Christina Rockson, _The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School_, South Africa, and the child of Mrs. Aleta Makomeke, _DEO at Masvingo province_ are Edoofians and they have many more success stories from _St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, *Advent Hope Academy*, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High_, etc.
05/01/24, 13:52 - Ananya: Along with this, schools can be benefited in the following way:
1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‚ÄòA-Level‚Äô/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(PHD.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
05/01/24, 13:52 - Ananya: Once you go through all the information, and see that this can be a million opportunities for your school, then please help me fill out the form so that the Program Director of Edoofa can contact you.

05/01/24, 13:54 - Ananya: Make sure, not to share all of these in one go.
05/01/24, 13:55 - George EWYL23E1028: Okay thank you noted
05/01/24, 13:58 - Ananya: This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success
‚ñ™Ô∏èVisiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear of presenting himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.

05/01/24, 14:14 - Ananya: So,George ! As a mentor, I want to ensure that you earn credits and utilize this opportunity to finance your own education. To achieve this, I usually set a target for my students from the start. This helps me understand their potential and the skills required for the future. So, are you ready for your first target?
05/01/24, 14:14 - George EWYL23E1028: Yes l'm ready
05/01/24, 14:21 - Ananya: Great! Your first target is to connect with at least one school head this week. Ask them to fill out the form so that we can schedule a meeting with us. Alright?
