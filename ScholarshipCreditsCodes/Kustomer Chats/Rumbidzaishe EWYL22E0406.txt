“The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.” ― Eleanor Roosevelt
14/03/23, 21:12 - Unknown: Rumbidzaishe, May I know what did we discuss in our last session?
14/03/23, 21:13 - Unknown: I am sure that you must have gone through the video that I shared with you last time?
14/03/23, 21:52 - Rumbidzaishe EWYL22E0406: It was the community building project
14/03/23, 22:02 - Unknown: Yes, You are right
And Can you please respond to the message regarding the video?
14/03/23, 22:09 - Rumbidzaishe EWYL22E0406: Yes l also saw the video in the other group
14/03/23, 22:10 - Unknown: Great!
Let us move ahead then
14/03/23, 22:10 - Unknown: Now once the students have seen the video, Please ask them what they understood from it
After the students have shared their understanding, We can follow up using the message given below:
You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within a span of 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
14/03/23, 22:11 - Rumbidzaishe EWYL22E0406: Okay noted sir
14/03/23, 22:23 - Unknown: After this, You can interact with students by asking if they have any queries so far or not. Once all the queries have been dealt with, It is now time that we share the Student Application Form with the students and ask them to share it in the group.
Feel free to take my help if you have any doubts regarding the queries that you might get from the students.
14/03/23, 22:24 - Rumbidzaishe EWYL22E0406: That l will do sir noted
14/03/23, 22:25 - Unknown: So Edoofian, now comes the interesting part where you will be rewarded with scholarship credits for networking with your connection. 
After the student shares their referral and once they have a personalized counselling session with one of our career counsellors just like how you have experienced, the counsellor will ask some points of the student regarding how they got to know about Edoofa and if they understand our program structure. I hope you have explained to the student as we have discussed right?
14/03/23, 22:25 - Rumbidzaishe EWYL22E0406: Still looking for students
14/03/23, 22:27 - Unknown: Yes, Rumbidzaishe.
But I hope that you will do as instructed above, right?
14/03/23, 22:36 - Rumbidzaishe EWYL22E0406: Okay noted sir
14/03/23, 22:43 - Unknown: Great!
14/03/23, 22:43 - Unknown: Once a student that you have submitted to me confirms the details, you will be awarded scholarship credits for bringing an aspiring student to us. For every 25 students whom we confirm is a successful connection from your network, you will be awarded *$10 worth of scholarship credits*.
14/03/23, 22:51 - Rumbidzaishe EWYL22E0406: Noted
14/03/23, 23:03 - Unknown: So consider every 25 students as a milestone for you. You have to note here that if the student does not confirm that they are not a connection from your side or that you are unaware about the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you will not be awarded for the credits so I hope you will make sure that it is very important to explain everything to the student.
14/03/23, 23:12 - Rumbidzaishe EWYL22E0406: Noted sir l will
14/03/23, 23:28 - Unknown: Now, for every student that enrols in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*. So till the time they complete the admission process, it is best for you to stick with them and at the same time share your daily experience in the EWYL Program to make them familiar with the program.

27/03/23, 16:51 - Unknown: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits.

30/03/23, 16:25 - Unknown: Dear Students,
I hope this message finds you well. As your EWYL progresses, it is important that you stay up to date with your assignments and coursework. In order to ensure that you are able to move forward with the new lessons, I want to remind you that you must complete all of your previous assignments by the end of this week.

It is essential that you take the time to thoroughly review and complete your previous assignments. Doing so will not only help you to understand the lesson better, but it will also prepare you for the upcoming lessons. Failure to complete the previous assignments may result in a delay of the new lessons, and ultimately, it may impact your EWYL progress.

Therefore, I urge you to make the completion of your previous assignments a priority. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to seeing your completed assignments and to sharing the new lessons with you soon.

I hope this message finds you well. 

\"Consistency is the foundation of achievement. Stay consistent in your actions, and you will achieve your goals.\"

As discussed in Wednesday's lesson, consistency is key to achieving your goals. In order to assess your understanding of this topic, I request that you submit a brief write-up on what you learned from the lesson and your discussions with your mentors, and how you plan to apply it to your daily routine. Please submit your responses before your next Scheduled Session.

Also, I want you to write a heartfelt message to your mentors, discussing the obstacles you are encountering that are preventing you from maintaining consistency in your sessions and EWYL submissions.

Remember, consistency is not just about doing something once, but about making a habit. So, let's work together to build consistent study habits and achieve success!

But if a student is not active during this time slot, then this defeats the whole purpose.
