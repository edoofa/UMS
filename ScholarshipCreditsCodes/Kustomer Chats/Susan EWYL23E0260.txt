Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!

10/07/23, 12:14 - Susan EWYL23E0260: According to Alex, he described consistency as a powerful trait to success in various aspects of life. Today l am going to delve into the realm of inspiration. I am going to discuss how my role model inspire me to be who am l today because of his inspirational story. Today l am going to talk about the late Prophet TB Joshua. TB Joshua was born in   poverty family and he was an orphan. He learned in six schools in one annum because of lack of educational tools such as money and stationery. One thing that inspired me is that he stay focused nomatter what he was facing. He showed that consistency is a powerful key to achieve goals because he nature's his perseverance. This helps him to stay focused and motivated to go on with school journey despite challenges and setbacks he was facing. Despite, the challenges he was facing he maintained good habits and he was not disturbed. He was not found a victim of school drop out and drug dealer  because he knows good habits will produce good yields and they are easy to maintain. As one man said and l quote you shall reap what you sow.His good habits and promises develop trust and faith in the eyes and heart of the Minister and he was given a scholarship to cater for his education until he reached his terti university. He was able to achieve this because of faith, dedication, commitment, discipline, determination of what he wants in his life despite problems surrounding him. Consistency end up him a famous successful person and it enables him to built his empire and legacy and he still remembered today. His inspirational journey has changed many people's life's and it teaches people to stand still, focused and determined momatter what you are facing right now because there is no gain without pain and were there is desire their is fire and it does not mean you are going to be burned so just try and you will make it. His inspirational story embodies me to be someone better today  and it adds growth and development in my life  for example when l was in my ordinary level l was someone with bad habits, who has no direction with school work and life but from the day l read TB Joshua inspirational story it changed me totally and l started reading my books daily and this end up me passing with flying colours every term and. This enables me to win presents on prize giving days every year and this made me the best student of the year. His story changed me positevly.
