25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.

To help you make the most of all the projects available, I have devised a target table that has proven to be successful for many of my students. By following this target, you can contribute your time in a smart way and earn many credits along the way.

09/06/23, 17:57 - Audrey EWYL22E0063: Okay thank you for the link
09/06/23, 18:02 - Unknown: I understand, now may I know if you were able to read your Wednesday lesson?
09/06/23, 18:06 - Audrey EWYL22E0063: Yes I read it
09/06/23, 18:07 - Unknown: Yes, so would you like to brief me about the same?
09/06/23, 18:11 - Audrey EWYL22E0063: It was talking about the start-up book which talks bout the guidelines on how to build our professional lives and be successful in a striving environment. It talks about competitive advantage and a lot of other things
09/06/23, 18:15 - Unknown: Yes, and Audrey I have a favorite part of the Wednesday lesson: Pivot Strategically: The ability to pivot and adapt to new circumstances is crucial in an ever-changing world. The authors explain how to recognize when it's time to make a career pivot and provide insights into managing transitions effectively. They emphasize the importance of maintaining a growth mindset and being proactive in shaping your own future.
09/06/23, 18:17 - Audrey EWYL22E0063: Yes indeed thank you
09/06/23, 18:18 - Unknown: I want to highlight the importance of this because as you prepare to leave your home and embark on your new journey in India, you may encounter various challenges. However, it is essential to adapt to these new circumstances in order to foster personal growth. Embracing change and being open to new experiences will not only help you navigate the challenges but also provide opportunities for growth and development. Therefore, it's crucial to be adaptable and embrace the changes that come your way as you embark on this new chapter of your life in India.
09/06/23, 18:20 - Audrey EWYL22E0063: Exactly
09/06/23, 18:25 - Unknown: Alright, I have an exciting new resource for you when it comes to the community building project! Several of my students have already given it a try and achieved improved results.
09/06/23, 18:25 - Audrey EWYL22E0063: I can't wait to also use it
09/06/23, 18:27 - Unknown: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about
Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not.
09/06/23, 18:27 - Unknown: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe.

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA which gives opportunities to Earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course.
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the 5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship. Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

09/06/23, 18:50 - Audrey EWYL22E0063: Okay I'll check it out
10/06/23, 13:08 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week’s Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better—together. It’s why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger—as successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!
