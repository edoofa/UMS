Have an incredible and productive day ahead!
24/11/23, 13:10 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0834: Good morning to you too ma'am
24/11/23, 13:11 - Unknown: How are you doing Ropafadzo?
24/11/23, 13:12 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0834: I'm doing okay ma'am and yourself
24/11/23, 13:26 - Unknown: I am also good, thank you so much for asking.
24/11/23, 13:26 - Unknown: Let's also explore the progress of the projects you've been actively engaged in. Let's start with the Community Building Project.
In this initiative, you're reaching out to build a community and share Edoofa opportunities.
24/11/23, 13:27 - Unknown: How's it going? I'm keen to know how much work you've put into it.

How many students have you interacted with so far?

And what are the difficulties or challenges that you are facing?
24/11/23, 13:33 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0834: So far So far I've talked to two people. It really hasn't been hard but maybe it's because they are my friends
24/11/23, 13:46 - Unknown: That's a great start! Talking to friends can often make the process more comfortable, and it's fantastic that you've already initiated conversations with two people. As you continue your efforts, whether with friends or others, you might find that the more you engage in these discussions, the more confident you become.
Remember, spreading the word about opportunities, such as the Edoofa scholarship program, is a meaningful way to contribute to others' education.
24/11/23, 13:46 - Unknown: What has been the challenge so far Ropafadzo?
24/11/23, 14:10 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0834: The major challenge has been finding people to engage with because most people after they finish they became hard to access
24/11/23, 14:38 - Unknown: It's understandable that reaching out to individuals right after exams can be challenging, as they might be taking a break or engaging in other activities. In such situations, you might consider adjusting your approach to accommodate their availability.
Here are a few strategies:
24/11/23, 14:38 - Unknown: Utilize Multiple Channels:Beyond online communication, explore other channels where individuals  might be active, such as social media platforms or email. Diversifying  your approach can increase the likelihood of reaching them.
24/11/23, 14:38 - Unknown: Collaborate with Educational Institutions:Work with schools or educational institutions to reach students through  official communication channels. They may have more success in  encouraging student participation.
24/11/23, 14:38 - Unknown: Plan for Post-Exam Period:Anticipate the post-exam period and plan your outreach efforts  accordingly. If possible, engage with individuals before exams conclude  or plan activities that align with their post-exam schedules.
24/11/23, 14:39 - Unknown: Persistence and Follow-Up:Given that individuals may be initially hard to reach, persistence and consistent follow-up can be key. Gentle reminders or periodic check-ins can help maintain engagement.
Remember, adapting your strategy based on the unique circumstances, and being patient and persistent can contribute to more successful engagement. If you have any specific challenges or questions, feel free to share, and I'm here to assist!
24/11/23, 14:42 - Unknown: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.
 And make sure that you share the Application forms and updates on school project with me.
24/11/23, 14:49 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0834: Yes ma'am thank you very much
27/11/23, 13:03 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0834: Good morning Ms Sharda

I wanted to bring to your attention a technical glitch that occurred last week, resulting in a repetition of the Saturday activity.
To ensure clarity and provide you with the most relevant content, I'll be sending the updated activity for this week shortly. You can take today's time in completing the task. I would appreciate your response before 9:30 am tomorrow. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

27/11/23, 16:41 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL

28/11/23, 12:53 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0834: *Spirit of competition*
To me it's like a driving force to do better, and archive more than I did last time. At first I really thought it was about competing with those around me, although that is still necessary sometimes, it's always more fruitful competing against ones past self. This way no matter how many times I fail and fall down the goal is that next time even if I fall again I don't fall in the same place but instead I progress.

When I started A level, I really didn't know what I was getting into. Lower six first month I failed everything except biology. Then I saw my other classmates competing for the top spot. In my I'm like next I'm going to be there no matter what so I put in the effort and I got first in biology, we had a draw in chemistry for first and I was second in maths. Later on everything became a lot, more things to learn and understand. Hence people gave up competing and our overall class grade depressed and just like everyone else I gave in to the pressure. Then a new girl came she was always on top and in my head I'm like you know what it's fine she can take everything but not biology, that's mine I've always been first, but guess what she did. Do from then I started computing again but this time it didn't help much, that's when I realized I might be competing with the wrong person, so I started competing against my past self started reviewing my work and finding out what I got wrong and why. The I started to get back up, my grades where getting better and without even knowing it I also subconsciously began using the concept in other areas of my life.

"Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life." - Steve Jobs

Steve Jobs' quote emphasizes the preciousness of time and encourages us to live authentically. It reminds us to prioritize our own passions and pursuits rather than conforming to external expectations.

As we start our session, let's reflect on this quote. Now, how are you doing? I'm eager to hear about your thoughts and experiences as we continue our discussion.
28/11/23, 13:00 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0834: Good morning Ms Sharda

28/11/23, 13:26 - Unknown: What exactly do you have many?
28/11/23, 13:27 - Unknown: Now, let's shift attention to the three projects we've been discussing, particularly the

Community Building and African School Reforms initiatives.
28/11/23, 13:27 - Unknown: Could you provide an  update on the Community Building project? What progress have you made?


How many community-building forms have you successfully completed, and what is the typical number of students you have engaged with on average?
28/11/23, 13:39 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0834: To be honest these projects are a major step out of my comfort zone and it's taking a lot to not just give up
28/11/23, 13:53 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0834: But I still have interact with those two I have mentioned earlier but they're still hesitant to fill the forms
28/11/23, 13:56 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0834: There gas been a question of which courses do you offer
28/11/23, 14:18 - Unknown: I truly appreciate your honesty, [Student's Name]. Stepping out of your comfort zone for projects like these is indeed a significant challenge, but it's also where immense personal and professional growth can occur. Remember, your dedication is already making a positive impact.
Addressing the hesitation of the two individuals requires a tailored approach:


Understanding Their Concerns: Initiate a candid conversation to understand their specific hesitations. Is it related to the course offerings, scholarship details, or other concerns? This insight will guide your responses.

Course Information: Provide detailed information about the courses offered by Edoofa. Share specific details such as curriculum highlights, faculty expertise, and potential career paths associated with each course.

Personal Stories: Share success stories of individuals who initially had reservations but found immense value in the Edoofa program. Personal narratives can be powerful motivators.
28/11/23, 14:18 - Unknown: Addressing Concerns Directly: If there are specific  concerns or questions, address them directly and assure them that you're  there to support them throughout the process.
28/11/23, 14:18 - Unknown: Remember, facing challenges is part of the journey, and your  perseverance is commendable. If you ever feel overwhelmed or need  guidance, don't hesitate to reach out. Your efforts are making a  difference, and I'm here to support you.
28/11/23, 14:19 - Unknown: I am also sharing a document on your EWYL group which has details of courses offered through Edoofa. Kindly check the document there.
28/11/23, 14:20 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0834: Thank you so very much
28/11/23, 14:21 - Unknown: You are most welcome.
28/11/23, 14:21 - Unknown: Have you encountered any other challenges that require my attention? I'm curious to hear your perspective on the project's current status.
28/11/23, 14:24 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0834: I still feel like it's a struggle to connect with people but I also feel that it is going well despite my prejudice
28/11/23, 14:27 - Unknown: It's completely natural to feel a bit challenged when stepping outside your comfort zone, Ropafadzo. Building connections, especially when advocating for something important, can be both rewarding and challenging. It's encouraging to hear that despite any initial reservations, you believe things are progressing well.
Here are a few thoughts to keep in mind:
28/11/23, 14:27 - Unknown: *Celebrate Small Wins*: Acknowledge and celebrate the progress you've made. Each engagement, every form filled, and every question answered is a step forward.

*Embrace Growth*: Remember that personal growth often occurs in the face of challenges. Embrace the learning experiences that come with stepping out of your comfort zone.
28/11/23, 14:28 - Unknown: *Adapt and Learn:* If certain approaches seem challenging, consider adapting your strategy. Learn from each interaction, and use that knowledge to refine your approach moving forward.

*Seek Support*: Don't hesitate to reach out for support or advice. Whether from peers, mentors, or others involved in the project, sharing experiences and insights can be beneficial.
28/11/23, 14:28 - Unknown: *Positive Affirmation:* Remind yourself of the positive  impact you're making. Your efforts are contributing to the potential  transformation of lives through education.
28/11/23, 14:29 - Unknown: Remember, the journey may have its ups and downs, but your persistence  is key. You're making a difference, and that's something to be proud of.  If there's anything specific you'd like guidance on or if you need a  boost of encouragement, I'm here to help.
28/11/23, 14:30 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0834: Thank you for your words of encouragement
28/11/23, 14:32 - Unknown: You are most welcome Ropafadzo.
28/11/23, 14:32 - Unknown: Now that you have submitted the student application forms/ sooner or later be submitting  them for the Community Building Project  -


Please  make sure the students are completely aware of what Edoofa is and what it does and even the admission stages.
28/11/23, 14:33 - Unknown: If the student goes to the admission counselor and denies that his/her friend did not discuss anything about Edoofa then *you will not earn any scholarship credits*.

To be on a safer side. Connect with the students on WhatsApp personally. Once they fill the form. Then *give them resources and information about Edoofa*.

*Train them about the process* so they are informed completely when the admission counselors will contact them and also, *we will have proof that yes you have explained it all.*
28/11/23, 14:33 - Unknown: Along with that make sure you are giving them an explanation about your journey, about the benefits that you have got and about the skills that you will be acquiring in the process.



Make it clear to students that Edoofa is not a sponsorship platform. Rather, you will get a scholarship
on the basis of various factors which include your grades in previous classes, the way you perform in your interviews, your statement of purpose, your letter of recommendation and many more
28/11/23, 14:33 - Unknown: Also, you can compare the cost of studying in your own country with the cost of studying in India through Edoofa. And guess what? *It's usually cheaper to study in India with Edoofa!*
28/11/23, 14:34 - Unknown: Now I want to set a target and I will also send a plan to achieve that target.
This is regarding the community building project.


Goal/Target : Connect with at least 20 students before our next session  and you should be able to submit at leafd Edoofa forms. Connect with at least 20 students before our next session  and you should be able to submit at least  15 filled Edoofa forms.
28/11/23, 14:34 - Unknown: *So, we're wrapping up our session. It was a fantastic session, and I'm looking forward to our next session*.

And make sure that you share the Application forms and updates on school project with me.
28/11/23, 14:36 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0834: Yes ma'am thank you
28/11/23, 14:39 - Unknown: you are welcome please!
