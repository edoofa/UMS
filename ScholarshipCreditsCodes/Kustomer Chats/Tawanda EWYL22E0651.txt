\"Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.\" ~ Bruce Lee

In this week's Wednesday lesson, you learned about the different sorts of personalities a person carries, but only a true leader is one who understands their personality and can do wonders with its power. In today's activity, I want you to dig deeper into your own consciousness and learn more about the kind of personality you are. As I believe, the more you know yourself, the clearer your vision of the world and your mind gets. Below is a link to a personality test, which you shall be taking up this week, and then would be sharing the results via a screenshot to your mentors by Monday. You can then read and understand more about your results by discussing them with your Mentor.

This particular exercise is going to give you an insight into the kind of person you are so that you can use your strengths to yield the maximum benefits in whatever work you take up.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own personality while performing this activity.

Have a wonderful weekend ahead.

Deadline -  Monday.

14/11/22, 21:11 - Unknown: Hello Tawanda! Are you ready for your session?
14/11/22, 21:13 - Tawanda EWYL22E0651: L was ready but it's unfortunate that my phone's battery is about to die and it cannot sustain the whole session we have got a power failure due to rain here but l think at around 6pm the power would be back
14/11/22, 21:13 - Unknown: Ahh, I understand that, will you battery be able to sustain for 40 minutes?
14/11/22, 21:14 - Tawanda EWYL22E0651: Yes l think it can manage sir
14/11/22, 21:17 - Unknown: Great! So if I get your undivided attention for the next 40 minutes I guess, we should be able to easily have a fruitful discussion.
14/11/22, 21:18 - Tawanda EWYL22E0651: Yes sir I would do just that
14/11/22, 21:19 - Unknown: Glad to hear that Tawanda! So did you take the test that was sent to you in the Saturday Activity?

14/11/22, 21:30 - Tawanda EWYL22E0651: Should I briefly summarize it

14/11/22, 21:34 - Tawanda EWYL22E0651: Let me start by saying according to my understanding of the results my personality suited with the color gold . This therefore means am a person who is responsible and likes to plan about the future and also l am predictable. L am also that kind of person who likes helping others wether through my career or by volunteering. Also I like operating by the rules and strictly rules .
14/11/22, 21:37 - Unknown: That is some great understanding Tawanda, so can you tell me, how do you think this entire understanding about your personality can help you in your daily tasks, and projects, and how are you planning to implement your strengths?
14/11/22, 21:41 - Tawanda EWYL22E0651: Having this great understanding about my personality would help me in an undefined way l as l would know what suits me and what does not . This also helps not waste time on things which I know that they are not favoured by my personality. Knowing that l like to help others would help me building strong relationships which when l also need help let's say in my projects people would not hesitate to help since they know me very well. Also it would make my projects easy those people whom l help have got also their friends and families which can help me Link up with them more easily
14/11/22, 21:51 - Unknown: I am really proud of your approach Tawanda!

17/11/22, 21:34 - Tawanda EWYL22E0651: That would be great sir
17/11/22, 21:36 - Unknown: Hello, my dear proud Edoofian. I hope all is well with you.

Another insightful Wednesday Wisdom is presented here. The lesson today teaches us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, disability. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition. A few questions near the end of the session will ask you to reflect and have an open dialogue with yourself. After you finish your lesson, as your mentor, I'd like to have a thorough conversation about your key take aways, in our upcoming sessions.

Enjoy the article and keep in mind that success does not come to you suddenly; rather, it can be attained over time by making modest, daily improvements.

Happy learning!

This week's Wednesday Wisdom was brimming with inspiration and determination to overcome any challenge and stay the course on the way to your ultimate objective. Your objective as a proud Edoofian now is to develop the necessary abilities and prepare for the workforce. I want to assist you in self-financing your education as your mentor. I'd like to let you know that you've already accrued X(add the amount earned) scholarship credits. I would like for you to submit a submission outlining your aims and objectives, including the number of credits, time commitment, and abilities you hope to have mastered by the time you have finished your degree program.

Pour your heart out; I'm here to listen and support your development.

Last date of submission: Monday
Word limit: 200 words

20/11/22, 05:26 - Tawanda EWYL22E0651: Let me start by briefly saying that l have got a quite number of objectives and aims which l hope to have mastered by the time I will finish my degree program. One of my main aim is to aquire knowledge from other nations which is not my own as this would help me and the people l will be working around to brainstorm on how to eradicate some certain diseases since we would have different version of the diseases and also to introduce some certain ways which are being used in other nations to treat people and it stands also as one of my objectives. Also l did like to say building a strong medical facility in my community is one of my aims as l know the kind of suffering they endure when it comes to medical facilities. My other objective or aim is to make my family proud and also make them feel like it was not a waste of time sending me to school. Also as time goes l would not like to continue serving directly as l would like to be a teacher of microbiologist which has been the agreement my friends and l made as we persue our careers. Without forgetting that it is everyone's wish and aim to become successful in this life we are living. 
 By the time I would be recorded to have finished my degree program I would like to have aquired some abilities and skills on the way . These abilities includes good communication skills, hospitality, caring and feeling for others and also not forgetting that I would like to have aquired the skill of being able to serve as a microbiologist at large. These skills would help me as l would be meeting different types of people with different types of characters,so by these abilities one would be able to tolerate even the worst from people you meet. Also as we know some diseases which we suffer from don't require medical they just need something like relief of stress depression as these can cause harm too and they only way you can identify this is if you have the abilities l have mentioned above. Having good communication skills is
