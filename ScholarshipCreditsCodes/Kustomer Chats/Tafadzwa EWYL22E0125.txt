In 2016 the Zimbabwean government's revenue was  expected to be at ZWD 3.502 billions  whereas the expenditure was expected to be at ZWD 4.955 billions. This resulted in net borrowings of ZWD 1.452 billions in 2016 indicating that enough financial resources were not made available by the government to boost the economic growth. The current account balance of Zimbabwe was estimated to be negative USD 0.234 and is expected to decline at CAGR of 42.27% and reach USD 0.025 by 2022.

Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!
