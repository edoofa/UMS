12/07/22, 19:54 - Unknown: As asked in the activity, Please list the skills that are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring in a lot of learning.
13/07/22, 01:45 - Alveen EWYL21E0792: Well from what I have noted in the world at large for a student to get projects that are challenging, one needs focus as a very important skill. To focus brings about very colorful results. 

Secondly there is need for continuous consistency. As a student you do not always get things right the first time, so there is high need to remain consistent.

Third there is need for a student to be prayerful. As Dami shared, a prayerful life can lead to great success

14/07/22, 01:52 - Alveen EWYL21E0792: Sir I try to talk to you but you actually reply way past the normal time for the lesson. I listen to all your instructions but on the other side of it all you do not reply. How are we supposed to have a productive session like that?

14/07/22, 01:54 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

14/07/22, 14:48 - Alveen EWYL21E0792: It is quite an interesting and inspirational lecture about how Mr P Motsepe started and the bottom to end up being a billionaire. As Ms Davi highlighted, the main key points being shared in almost every success story is the spirit of never giving up. One has to be propelled by his own thrive to succeed. I have to work extra hard ,no matter how many times I might fail, the goal is to be on top so I should keep going. I loved how Mr Motsepe kept aiming for the best. He never settled for anything less that what he really wanted. I will note him down and research more about him. Thank you

16/07/22, 16:46 - Alveen EWYL21E0792: Well I started working for a start-up firm as a shop attendant. The business was mainly grocery based. I worked in the business very well hand in hand with the owner such that the business took a fast paced expansion from the place we were at. As I worked with no supervision and with transparency the owner liked me and admired my hardwork. I treated customers very well that they were actually leaving the shops they used to buy in to come to my shop, plus the prices were exceptionally good. This is what happened the owner is a teacher  who had the money , so when he asked me how to make it 100% fast growing, I highlighted on the importance of small profits making quick returns. We would sell our stock at a reasonably low price but the money would spin so quickly that in 2 months after opening the first store , the store I was in was barely remaining stocked. After sometime we decided to open another store at a very busy area. We found a new worker to stay at the shop I was in and I shifted to the new shop. I cannot lie at first it was as if people were not responding to our sales but with time  things changed. The owner was very happy with my work, systematic organizing the stock and my brilliance he decided to make me his \"bookman\". I passed my accounting subject at ordinary level doing the books for the shops was no hassle. I did everything with transparency and he felt good about having me. The more time I worked with him the more he trusted me. Apart from doing the books I began to be given orders of what was needed in the shops and he would give me his commuter omnibus to do everything when he was at work. I am a precise person such that I bought only what was on the list, his business shot green and it made him happy. Because he was making more money, you know how they say money is never enough, he opted to open yet another shop at his homestead. His wife was going to take care of that shop from home. It was a good shop and it grew rapidly as the a

16/07/22, 21:49 - Unknown: Please also send the Proud Edoofian message tomorrow. Let's not miss out the momentum even on Sunday.??
18/07/22, 16:08 - Alveen EWYL21E0792: Good morning sir, your proud Edoofian is here to learn.

The weekend activity was very interesting as it actually gave me an inside view of my future business idea. As I researched on the fastest growing business sector here in Zimbabwe, I saw a lot of business which have actually been growing fast in the last 10 years at most. Businesses like wedding businesses,animal care businesses, online tutoring businesses, home based care businesses only to name a few. All these businesses are actually growing day by day here in Zimbabwe. The business sector I took and went on to do more research on was the home remodeling business. As I stated way before this assignment I am planning a future business in that similar field. Home remodeling is technically a business which deals with enhancing houses with properties which will make them more beautiful and comfortable to the residents. Basically we can say it adds more value to a house. This business includes different items like fixtures to the floors, doors and etc. Some of these home remodeling businesses deal with substituting the normal steel doors and with architectural aluminum and glass such as in portions for windows and doorsb  as mentioned prior. As I have said the house will have a better look than the old fashioned glass which broke easily. Other businesses in the same sector deal with the installations of swimming pools and fancy designs for the exterior of these homes. While another businesses fixes wooden sandyless floors compared to the cold normal floors. My favorite in these businesses as everything will be modernised  and the house will not be the same again.

Happy New Week, my proud Edoofian! How was your weekend?
18/07/22, 19:16 - Unknown: Did you work on the  very interesting Weekend activity? 

I personally enjoyed learning about SWOT analysis and implementing it for my self. I hope you did too.
19/07/22, 02:07 - Alveen EWYL21E0792: Sir may you please enlighten me on what SWOT analysis is
19/07/22, 02:49 - Unknown: Sure Alveen!
19/07/22, 02:49 - Unknown: SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment.This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organisations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
19/07/22, 02:49 - Unknown: As seen above, SWOT is an acronym of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. However, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym:

1 Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
2 Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
3 Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
4 Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by

This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.

25/07/22, 15:24 - Alveen EWYL21E0792: Hello sir, good morning. I am a proud Edoofian! 

*Life as it is is more of a reward for the choices we make as we grow up. The outcomes of each and every one of us is a mare reflection of how we reacted to our every day problems. Thus for a change in life experience you have to change your mindset. Speaking on the growth mindset of successful people, we see almost similar traits. Those traits made a difference in these people because they had a different mindset from others at large. To have a mindset which shows a great outcome in future you need firstly and foremost to be someone accountable for the mistakes you make. Blaming others will not fix the problem, rather hold yourself responsible and find a solution will. After that you have to focus on doing your best on correcting the mistake for the better, this means your mindset must be equipped with focus and hardwork. As I have learned this, I am bound to wake up with a success planning mind, a mindset which accepts mistakes and a mind which thrives to work hard on being a successful person in the near future. Thank you!*
