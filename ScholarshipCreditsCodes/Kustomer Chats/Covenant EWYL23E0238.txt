14/06/23, 14:18 - Covenant EWYL23E0238: Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am Covenant and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Covenant EWYL23E0238
15/06/23, 11:16 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.
Our sessions are on Monday and Thursday from 12:00 PM to 1:30 PM.
