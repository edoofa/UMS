12/12/23, 18:51 - Justine EWYL21E0737: *Wednesday Wisdom*
*Excel*

Excel is a very useful tool for organising and representing data in a systematic and understandable way.

Being able to proficiently use Excel for data management and processesing tool is a very profound skill in today's world. With the introduction of AI features in Microsoft Excel being able an expert at this skill increases your value and chances of being successful in many fields because Excel is not o ky limited to Computing Industries but also in commercial and other various sectors
12/12/23, 18:59 - Justine EWYL21E0737: I also learnt a few things from the pdf about Excel
For example when adding or finding average of cells in a table I would write each excel column I wanted to add its value when I could have just used the colon since the cells in the table are ein chronological order.

For example is I want to add  Cells A1 to 10 i would do this following 
*=SUM(A1,A2,A3,A4, ..... , A10*
when I could have done it like this
*=SUM(A1:A10)*
The same goes for *average*


The *vlookup* feature is also something new
12/12/23, 19:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Good evening Justin,
How are you?
12/12/23, 19:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Your recognition of Excel as a powerful tool for organizing and presenting data resonates deeply, and your emphasis on the importance of proficiency in data management and processing is spot-on. In an era where data plays a crucial role in decision-making across various sectors, your understanding of Excel's role as a versatile skill set is truly commendable.
12/12/23, 19:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, I am equally thrilled to receive your response on the Saturday activity, but did you try this on Excel?
12/12/23, 19:09 - Justine EWYL21E0737: I am doing fine ma'am 

I just can't wait to finish this semester üò¢üò¢
12/12/23, 19:09 - Justine EWYL21E0737: The codes yes I tried them

03/03/23, 21:10 - Justine EWYL21E0737: *Wednesday Lesson*

Compared to many entrepreneurs during that time, the Bacher brothers surely put a lot of work to be able to be recognized withing a short time of 2 years.

The two brothers had a goal and they invested in a factor that lead them to success, technology.
When they saw an opportunity in E-commerce, that was one of the major steps that lead them to where they are now.

I understood the hard work put by the two founders. I also learnt to value customer care. That is what the two did. They made their website convinient and easy for customers and making their customers happy,[customer-centric]
03/03/23, 21:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Justine!
How are you?
03/03/23, 21:49 - Saloni Rastogi: I completely agree with you and I believe experiences make us feel alive: there are times when we live our lives and slowly let them pass us by. This can happen when you stick to the same routine day and night without doing anything new. Going through life in the same 'state' can be tedious, but an unforgettable experience will awaken your mind and soul.
 Innovation is the reflection of change and solution in respect of some problems in Life. Innovations by any means are basically the solutions to our daily life problems

06/03/23, 18:49 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he‚Äôd received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he‚Äôd paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

‚ÄúYour honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,‚Äù he replied.

‚ÄúHow do you weight the butter then?‚Äù Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

‚ÄúYour honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I‚Äôve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it‚Äôs the baker.‚Äù

10/03/23, 21:55 - Saloni Rastogi: First, the group that you have created for the community building project, you do not update it daily.
10/03/23, 21:56 - Justine EWYL21E0737: What are those ma'am
10/03/23, 21:56 - Saloni Rastogi: Second, there is no increase in the number of participants in the group, may I know ho are you reaching out to them?
10/03/23, 22:00 - Justine EWYL21E0737: The people i reached out to do not want to go outside the country. I need to reach to nore people.
10/03/23, 22:00 - Justine EWYL21E0737: But at this point i a stuck because most leads i got were dead ends
10/03/23, 22:05 - Saloni Rastogi: Okay, let me help you.
10/03/23, 22:06 - Saloni Rastogi: 1) Have you reached out to all the students in the A level and O level?
10/03/23, 22:10 - Justine EWYL21E0737: Those at a level i did
10/03/23, 22:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Everyone?

10/03/23, 22:40 - Saloni Rastogi: But we discussed that you need need to be a part of there class groups this will ensure that everyone knows about the group and Edoofa.
10/03/23, 22:40 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, you can use Facebook as a platform.
10/03/23, 22:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Look at the number of participants in the group, we will reach out to them as well.

- Winston S. Churchill

Through the previous Wednesday lesson, we got an idea that how necessary it is to grab every opportunity and make the best use of it. Also, it is well said that  is a will, there is a way. But to make this opportunity, we must have extremely useful and fruitful skills that can turn into a big game. And telling these skills and practices that are necessary for grabbing skills was the *weekend activity* all about.
I want you to *share your views on the same with me here*.

15/07/22, 21:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my proud EDOOFIAN!

From his dad‚Äôs small foray into entrepreneurship, Patrice Motsepe got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe‚Äôs success story is a remarkable one showing how curiosity, doggedness, perseverance, and the knack to exploit great opportunities as they come, can determine how successful or not, any individual could become. 
And this was all about our WEDNESDAY WISDOM.
Hope you have gone through it.
I am so excited to listen to your thoughts and views HERE.
15/07/22, 22:10 - Justine EWYL21E0737: Morning ma'am

Let me resend it
15/07/22, 22:13 - Justine EWYL21E0737: Good afternoon

I did read through the pdf
16/07/22, 01:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Justine!
How's your day going?
16/07/22, 01:30 - Saloni Rastogi: I am really glad to hear your understanding of the last weekend's activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY*. They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.
16/07/22, 01:30 - Saloni Rastogi: Now Justine, I want you to share your response to the Wednesday lesson.
16/07/22, 01:31 - Saloni Rastogi: I am not able to access any of the files that you have sent here, can you please send them to the group?
16/07/22, 05:56 - Justine EWYL21E0737: *Wednesday task response*

I think Patrice Tlhopane was focused and strategic.

My O level English always used to talk about *critical thinking* and planning what you want. We nicknamed her *The Critical thinker*?.

The point I am trying to highlight is that he saw an opportunity to grow through buying the collapsing mine shaft. Anyone else would have seen the idea unprofitable but because he had strategically devised his plan, he was able to turn the tides around. He also studied a lot about the mining industry before he ventured into it and that helped him go pass his limits.
16/07/22, 05:57 - Justine EWYL21E0737: Good evening

Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a WAY. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. We can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.

22/07/22, 03:30 - Saloni Rastogi: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness.

And this was what our *WEDNESDAY Wisdom* was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
22/07/22, 23:13 - Justine EWYL21E0737: Good afternoon ma'am
23/07/22, 00:04 - Justine EWYL21E0737: It is true, nothing happens magically. You have to make it happen

The activity clearly elaborates on this
23/07/22, 02:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you please elaborate a bit more.
23/07/22, 03:56 - Justine EWYL21E0737: I was summarizing the whole lesson.

In the Case of the sailor who was frustrated at the sea, all he did was blame it on the sea itself forgetting the other factors.

This happens in our daily life when we face problems or disappointments, we find it much easier to blame the possible factors or people around us, and not taking and accepting the responsibility that we are the cause for our own failure.

Doing that makes us great leaders like you once told me and to helps you solve the problems much quicker and easier because you look at the things you lack or did that caused the failure and helps you evade from such future problems.
23/07/22, 05:19 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your response Justine and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one‚Äôs goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
23/07/22, 05:36 - Justine EWYL21E0737: Thank you ma'am and yeah,

27/07/22, 21:36 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your understanding of the activity and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it‚Äôs not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you‚Äôre looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don‚Äôt do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it‚Äôs one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.

*I am a proud Edoofian*
29/07/22, 00:30 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.

29/07/22, 17:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Good morning Justine!
How's your day going?
29/07/22, 17:51 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing absolutely lovely, thanks for asking.
29/07/22, 17:53 - Saloni Rastogi: I hope this motivates you Justine to rise and climb greater heights each day.
29/07/22, 17:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, we can have our session for today.
Time management is defined as using your time productively and efficiently‚Äîbut what about when you are working as productively as possible, and you still can‚Äôt get everything done? It may be better to think about time management as a combination of working productively and prioritizing your time.

Our *Wednesday Wisdom* was all about Time Management and understanding the priority matrix to organize our tasks. 
I am really excited to hear your understanding and working on the same.
Please share it with me here.
In today's session we will talk about:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. progress on community building projects.
29/07/22, 20:43 - Justine EWYL21E0737: Good afternoon ma'am

We may begin with our session.
29/07/22, 20:47 - Justine EWYL21E0737: Well, the lesson was not a whole new to me

But, I do acknowledge that it helped me understand better.

Great and successful people do know how to manage their time. It is more than just knowing about it but with time, it grows to become a skill which can help you succeed and accommodate all your tasks.
29/07/22, 20:54 - Justine EWYL21E0737: I hope you don't mind me sharing this story,

Last year I had a classmate who would come to school and explain every detail about the movies he would have watched and yet he would come out top of the class in all tests. I would always wonder how he managed to do that, considering the fact that he too does chores at home. I thought he was lying to until I learned about time management.

Well, my brother educated me about it. I put into practice what he taught me and with time I got better. The activity taught me a new way to be more time conscious. The Priority matrix is a whole new thing to me but I understand and acknowledge that it can better help me manage my time.
30/07/22, 03:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Good evening Justine!
How's your day going?
30/07/22, 03:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Your response to the Wednesday wisdom has made me realize our childhood quote  is Money'.
Through Wednesday Wisdom, my main aim was to educate my Edoofians about TIME MANAGEMENT and HOW IT CAN BE ACHIEVED.
You know are very well aware of what Time management means, let me tell you about what Time Management includes:

#Effective Planning
# Setting goals and objectives
# Setting deadlines
# Delegation of responsibilities
# Prioritizing activities as per their importance
# Spending the right time on the right activity

The benefits of Time Management are:
- Time Management makes an individual punctual and disciplined.
- One becomes more organized as a result of effective Time Management.
- Individuals who stick to a time plan are the ones who realize their goals and objectives within the shortest possible period. 
- Research says that individuals who accomplish tasks on time are less prone to stress and anxiety. 

How can we achieve it:
# Set a goal for yourself.
# Priority matrix (like we talked about in the Wednesday lesson)
# Organize your study space
# Do a SWOT Analysis of yourself.

I am sure you will note all these things and imply in your day-to-day life and do share with me what changes you have felt.
30/07/22, 03:12 - Saloni Rastogi: I am so glad that you shared this story with me.
I also had difficulty managing time during my school time, each day I used to ask my mother how did she do that.
She told me about the priority matrix but of course, in her manner, at that time I did not understand her well. But now since I am working, having my home to manage, and also having my things to do, the priority matrix has become my day-to-day thing.
30/07/22, 03:20 - Justine EWYL21E0737: My day went well
