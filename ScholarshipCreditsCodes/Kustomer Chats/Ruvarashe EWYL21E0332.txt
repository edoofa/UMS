12/07/22, 21:00 - Unknown: Good afternoon Ruvarashe!
How did your day go?
12/07/22, 21:01 - Unknown: Ruvarashe you said you were facing some problem, please let me know. I will be happy to resolve them.
12/07/22, 22:20 - Ruvarashe EWYL21E0332: The things is my acceptance letter had errors and I wanted it for the VISA because I'm told ti visit the Embassy. So, I then texted Ms Vilsha admissions officer and she helped me now everything is okay. Thank you mam for being concerned. I appreciate.
14/07/22, 03:24 - Unknown: Great to see your understanding of being a proud EDOOFIAN.
14/07/22, 03:25 - Unknown: I am so glad that the issue is resolved now, great relief.

16/07/22, 16:42 - Ruvarashe EWYL21E0332: I'm a proud Edoofian!
16/07/22, 16:43 - Ruvarashe EWYL21E0332: What I learned from the Wednesday lesson was that, A son grew up helping his father who started as a teacher and later on owned a shop (Patrice) and he didn't start at top but he started small. There's a trend of successful people which is the sense of never giving up. Patrice advanced his education and his first degree of Arts he got it from the University of Swaziland then later on went for Law and attained education and got LLB. He then went to work for Bowman's Law firm in South Africa. Patrice got so successful because his drive, commitment to growth, and high success work rates got his bosses take a unique interest in him.Patrice staring up mining and law business was indeed a great turning point in his life, it changed him for the better.

16/07/22, 19:53 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Ruvarashe!
How's your day going?
16/07/22, 19:53 - Unknown: I read your response Ruvarashe and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a WAY. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. We can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.
16/07/22, 20:12 - Ruvarashe EWYL21E0332: Very true Mam, this great story of Patrice had made me realize where I should make some changes in my life. Thank you so much for this wonderful lesson.

19/07/22, 05:05 - Unknown: Going through your response made me so inquisitive to search about tourism in Zimbabwe Ruvarashe, I got so much engrossed in your clear vision of thoughts and simple and direct conversation into words. I got to know that Tourism is Zimbabwe’s third largest sector after mining and agriculture and has the potential to play a significant role in Zimbabwe’s economic recovery.  Zimbabwe has a number of national parks and natural attractions such as Hwange, Mana Pools, Gonarezhou national parks, Victoria Falls, Lake Kariba, and the Great Zimbabwe National Monument.
19/07/22, 05:05 - Unknown: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader. 
Also Ruvarashe, along with the SWOT analysis of a company, I would appreciate it if you also share a SWOT analysis of yourself. I want to see how much more you have learned beyond this activity.
19/07/22, 07:35 - Ruvarashe EWYL21E0332: Alright the SWOT ANALYSIS of my myself 1. *Stregnths*- I'm optimistic about the things I do and what I plan to do.

21/07/22, 21:43 - Unknown: Let's begin with our session Ruvarashe.
Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our *WEDNESDAY Wisdom* was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on the community building project (I have not received any forms from your end till now)
21/07/22, 21:46 - Ruvarashe EWYL21E0332: Greetings

25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Due to some medical emergency, I would not be able to take your session today.
But, nothing to worry about, I will do better after some time.
And by the time we have our next scheduled session, I want you to keep following the proud edoofian ritual.
Till then, have a great day.​
​And yes, we have our cultural festival tomorrow, named Raksha Bandhan. I want you to search for it, and if it gains your interest, we will surely discuss it in our next session.
11/08/22, 01:52 - Ruvarashe EWYL21E0332: Alright. And I hope all is well. Thank you for the update. Will we surely discuss about Raksha Bandhan when you come around.
11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
