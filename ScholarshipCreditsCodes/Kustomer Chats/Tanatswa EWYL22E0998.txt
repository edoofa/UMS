I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
31/01/23, 01:05 - Aditi Kapoor: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.


If you are ready then we can begin?
31/01/23, 01:21 - Aditi Kapoor: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

31/01/23, 19:46 - Aditi Kapoor: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

03/02/23, 00:26 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0998: Well, from Wednesday wisdom I understood that for students to share skills, lesson and experience which help to became creative and discover our true self and most importantly to develop new skills that will aid us in our journey to became successful professionals. Building network can became an excellent way to gain new prospector and ideas. It helps us to understand what we want and were w want to work in the future. Students starting university can find it difficult to grasp the idea of what they want to do, what they want for their future or for the course or does it apply to everyone or not. Some have already decided what they want to do in the future but are not using LinkedIn which can help them gain better prospections of your career path .
03/02/23, 00:27 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0998: From the Newsletter have learnt how to build a strong network with LinkedIn, you start by strengthening LinkedIn profile highlighting all of your best work this gives the decision makers of the companies an idea of the quality of work you have to offer. There's also use of LinkedIn groups and building your digital footprint.

24/04/23, 16:21 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian, ready for a motivational monday?

In a remote village, there lives a hardworking farmer who owns a farm. Over the years his grapery yields rich crops, and the farmer is very successful. He has three sons, who are young and energetic but never worry about working. As the farmer grows older, he begins to worry about his sons’ future.

Then he becomes very ill and feels that his death is coming soon. He calls his sons and says,

“Dear sons, I see my death approaching, but I want to share a secret before you all leave. These areas have treasure hidden inside. Dig the whole area after my death, to find it. ”

The old farmer died. The sons start digging for money without leaving any part of the field but nothing is found. In any case, digging their fields leads to healthier crops and results in higher incomes. These earnings make the sons realize what their father means.

What according to you is the moral of the story?

a. Hard work always pays off. The fruits of hard work are always sweet.
b. Be Selflessly kind
c. both a & b
24/04/23, 16:28 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0998: a
24/04/23, 19:46 - Aditi Kapoor: Also, may I know on which project will you work in the coming weeks?
