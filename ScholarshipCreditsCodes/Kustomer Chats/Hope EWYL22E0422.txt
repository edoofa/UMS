02/08/22, 16:44 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times pere week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these att

02/08/22, 18:10 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

Team edoofa has arranged a webinar  for you all, 
The webinar would be taken by Ronard Kachage.
Designation : Co founder at Success Magazine.

Date 05 August 
Time 3:30 PM [ Zimbabwe time ] 

Takeaways from the webinar.
The topic will be along the lines of how Mr. Kachaje went on to pursue a career in real estate by having a degree in the same field and eventually figured out his calling which was building the media brand  Magazine. One of the many benefits of starting a business or pursuing your passions when one is a bit older is that they bring all of the experience and wisdom to the table. 
The journey of Mr. Kachaje is certainly inspiring, growth-oriented, and a wonderful example for the youth of today, not only in terms of being passionate about what you believe in but also having a consistent outlook towards learning on the way and figuring things out at the same time.

10/08/22, 22:17 - Unknown: Today, if you go to New York, you will find hundreds of places where they learn chanting. People go for one hour in the evenings to chanting classes. They chant ‘Om Namah Shivaya’, which is originally an Indian Chant’. Of course, they have a different pronunciation .In China, they say, ‘Ladhe Ladhe’ .


Chanting brings us many medical, psychological and social benefits. In initial stages of chanting it may be difficult to recognise the benefits we derive from chanting. In later stages too, knowing the benefits of chanting can restore our faith after we have experienced them.

12/08/22, 22:24 - Unknown: So yes, did you do a quick research about Raksha Bandhan?
You know I had an amazing day yesterday. I am very excited to tell you how it all went.
First I put a red spot on my brother's forehead, it is called 'teeka'. Then we stick some rice to that spot and after that, I tied a beautiful decorative rakhi (a thread or ribbon) on this wrist.
Sisters do that for the long life of their brothers and to that, the brothers promise to protect their sisters.
Later we have delicious sweets and exchanged presents.

16/08/22, 17:49 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
How was your long weekend?

Let me educate you about the Indian independence day which was yesterday due to which we had a long weekend!
Independence Day, in India, is a national holiday celebrated annually on August 15. Independence Day marks the end of British rule in 1947 and the establishment of a free and independent Indian nation. It also marks the anniversary of the partition of the subcontinent into two countries, India and Pakistan, which occurred at midnight on August 14–15, 1947.

Isn’t this interesting?

So we know, a lot of you have been keeping busy these days with your exams and academic curriculum. And while we wish you all the luck for it, we don't want you to miss out on your learning and skill building. In today's lesson, we will discuss how to build our capacity to multitask, manage our time and prioritize our daily tasks in order to have it all. 

Let's dig right in, and understand how if you follow these steps, you will be able to manage your exams, assignments, extra curriculars, and your EWYL projects all at one go. After going through this, you must discuss the plan of action to execute these steps with your mentors.

Happy Learning!
