05/01/23, 22:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Some of my students have formed a WhatsApp group where they:
First, they keep sharing the link of that WhatsApp group in their family groups, class groups, and school groups (A-Level and O-Level), with the children who stay nearby (who want to pursue their higher education), and, try to circulate all around.
Second, once new people get added to the group, they are told about Edoofa, the perks of being associated with it, why studying in India could be a great opportunity, their journey so far, learnings from EWYL Program, and more.
Third, they share the community building form with them, and then the children fill out the form and share it with them.

What do you think about this?
05/01/23, 22:27 - Zoleka EWYL22E0669: It is a good idea will definitely try it
05/01/23, 22:52 - Saloni Rastogi: You can start from today and we will discuss it tomorrow in your session.

06/01/23, 21:12 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy Friday _my proud edoofian!_
How are you doing today?

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. This week's Wednesday wisdom gave you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

In our session today, we will discuss:
▪️your understanding of persuasion
▪️targets for the projects for the month of January 2023
06/01/23, 21:12 - Saloni Rastogi: Please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' for today.
06/01/23, 21:12 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
06/01/23, 21:16 - Zoleka EWYL22E0669: I am a proud edoofian good day
06/01/23, 21:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
06/01/23, 21:19 - Zoleka EWYL22E0669: Noted
06/01/23, 21:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Good day Zoleka!
06/01/23, 21:19 - Saloni Rastogi: I hope you went through the lesson, it was actually very amazing!
What do you have to say about that?
06/01/23, 21:26 - Zoleka EWYL22E0669: I learnt that I have to embrace  and develop a habit of saying I am a proud edoofian in order to remind my self of my promise and duty
06/01/23, 21:28 - Saloni Rastogi: - That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!

- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.

- How do you intend to broaden this student community? In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.","transform":"

06/01/23, 22:00 - Zoleka EWYL22E0669: I am excited
06/01/23, 22:03 - Saloni Rastogi: I have shared it on the group, please check,
06/01/23, 22:10 - Zoleka EWYL22E0669: I read the document  thank you
06/01/23, 22:19 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know what have you understood from it?
06/01/23, 22:38 - Zoleka EWYL22E0669: From the Wednesday lesson I learnt that persuasion as an important factor that affect decisions that people make particularly related to sales and purchases. Cialdini identified 6 core principles of persuasion that affect the decision making shortcut. It is believed that if one masters and understands them you can use them to your advantage persuade to others easily  to take a specific action or buy a specific product. The six principles are reciprocity, scarcity, authority, commitment and consistency, liking and consensus (social proof). These can be very useful in my EWYL tasks in persuading fellow students and others.
06/01/23, 22:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Your understanding is very impressive Zoleka!
What I understood from the lesson is that Understanding the art of persuasion can not only help you learn how to influence others; it can also make you more aware of the techniques others might use to try and change your beliefs and behaviors.
06/01/23, 22:43 - Saloni Rastogi: And yes, that's very true that all this can be very useful to persuade fellow students in becoming proud edoofians.
06/01/23, 22:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Yeah, from this, did you try the idea we discussed- WhatsApp group?
06/01/23, 22:49 - Zoleka EWYL22E0669: I am yet to try this
06/01/23, 23:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes Zoleka, I don't want you to miss the opportunity to earn your scholarship credits. I would encourage you to take an early start.
06/01/23, 23:18 - Zoleka EWYL22E0669: Yes thank you  will do so
10/01/23, 00:54 - Zoleka EWYL22E0669: This is a very common question asked to most sales people to find out their character or behaviour in the sales industry. The first thing you do is to find out your customers needs starting by asking  questions like what kind of pen have they used before or what they like to use pens for, this helps the salesman to show them how the pen is different. The salesman has to identify the features of the pen that meets the customers need, once there is a better understanding of the customers needs you can identify features that may appeal to. The salesman has to appeal to the customers emotions , make the customer emotionally attached to the pen because the customer may have a lot of pens so the salesman need to appeal to me customers emotions so the customer buy the pen
10/01/23, 00:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well!

04/04/23, 23:07 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead tomorrow.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him\/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
04/04/23, 23:17 - Zoleka EWYL22E0669: OK I will do so
04/04/23, 23:18 - Zoleka EWYL22E0669: OK I will do so

04/04/23, 23:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, I am sure that we will earn *more than $100 this month*, it is just that we have to be *regular and consistent* in our approach toward things.
Don't get disheartened because failure is also a step in the ladder that leads us to success. I am very pumped up to bring out the best in you, we will do great in the month, I know.
Let's connect tomorrow and see what the day holds for us :fireworks:
