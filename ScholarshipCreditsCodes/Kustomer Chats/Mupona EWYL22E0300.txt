19/07/22, 00:17 - Mupona EWYL22E0300: Good morning maam. We are having problems with our network so I am afraid I may fail to connect with you and Iam not sure for how long it will last. My apologies.
19/07/22, 01:00 - Unknown: Hello my proud edoofian,
Can you please notify me about your group name?
19/07/22, 01:01 - Mupona EWYL22E0300: Good afternoon. EWYL22E0300
19/07/22, 23:34 - Mupona EWYL22E0300: Good afternoon. My network today is better,I think I can have my session with less interuptions.
20/07/22, 23:39 - Mupona EWYL22E0300: Good afternoon. Iam ready for my session today.
22/07/22, 16:48 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr

22/07/22, 17:01 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

23/07/22, 20:17 - Unknown: Sat Activity:Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
This week, we discovered that people who are successful don't hold the world responsible for their failures. They accept accountability for their own choices and results. To develop this mindset of taking responsibility for everything and avoiding the blame game takes time and focus. As your Saturday Assignment your are required to write a short write up, on the growth mindset of successful people and how will you make sure you develop the same mindset. The word limit for this assignment is 150-200 words. Kindly make sure you follow the word limit strictly, any responses less than the minimum word limit will not be marked.
You are required to submit the same by Monday 10 AM  on the dedicated EWYL line.

25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Christian theology denotes as according to 1 Thessalonians 4:11 KJV
And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you.
These are words of Paul to one of the Christian churches as to how a respectable person of virtue should behave. Studying is not only important to succeed academically but opens up doorways to knowledge as well as wisdom neither is minding your own business being anti social or working hard alone a form of selfishness or greed for riches.
To be successful one needs humility. Its through humility that most successful people have become who they are today. Success is not about how much money one has but its in the impact and impartation of that one individual on others. 
Hence, I as an individual with an ambition to succeed, its my mandate to never stop reading and acquire knowledge. Its of great essence that I be a person of peace, knowing that skill only comes with hard work and a positive attitude.

 I am waiting for your answer and then I will share my understanding \/ opinion about them.

25/07/22, 23:18 - Mupona EWYL22E0300: Qn 1. As an edoofian who is also proud to be part of a vibrant community, I will work hard towards professional and social linkages to make sure that Edoofa goes beyond just being a home for gifted scholarship students but rather a home to a whole new community that wants to be part of Edoofa as an extention of the scholarship programme.

Qn 2.  I believe onness begins with me,just as love is not love until you give it away. I cannot be part of a community if I dont express the virtues and values of Edoofa and show that I believe in Edoofa and that Iam a proud Edoofian.

Actions that are based on the principles of Oneness are rewarding in the sense that they fill us with happiness and joy, whether or not you get your desired results.

I realised as soon as I started reading this lesson that most of my students needed to learn and grasp this. One person succeeding and one failing depends solely on how effectively they manage their time. Try to comprehend and apply the measures discussed in the lesson to your everyday life. I'll be here to help you, so that you can focus on learning how to manage your time effectively.
