23/10/23, 23:17 - Stanslous EWYL23E0653: *Jane‚Äôs Journey to Class Topper* 
By Stanslous Manoah 

Jane‚Äôs days were very good, but her time very less. As a school going girl she will always learn her lessons and her aim was to always be a class topper, but never did Jane once top her class, she always worked hard and Jane never kept her books aside. 24 hours of learning, but nothing was ever achieved. Mary the class tiller of the class would just learn for 2 hours a day and she mostly spent her time with gadgets. Jane the girl who always failed to the class topper became sad but that didn‚Äôt stop her from pulling through and going after her goal to be class topper. Deep work is more important for hard work to be reached and for your dream to become a reality. The time you spend is not a matter, the knowledge you gained in that time is more important. So, working few hours with deep work will help the hardworking person to reach the destination successfully. Jane learnt this and she pulled through in all her studies and never gave whereas Mary became to confident and that led to her downfall as the class topper. 

As Michelle Obama once said ‚Äòthere is no magic achievement. It‚Äôs really about hard work, choice and persistence‚Äô and this is what Jane used as her motto to reach for the stars and meet her goals.
25/10/23, 14:45 - Stanslous EWYL23E0653: Good morning Saturday activity is up
25/10/23, 14:48 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello, my Proud Edoofian!

26/10/23, 13:29 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, Please go ahead and share it with me
26/10/23, 13:38 - Stanslous EWYL23E0653: Okay so this week‚Äôs Wednesday wisdom was sharing the story of Farai Mudzingwa who started off as a journalist working at ZIM tech in 2018 to 2020 where he discovered and learnt the importance of social media in the form of YouTube 

His passion for wanting to spread information and building a functional social media community led him to create story untold zw which is a platform for all aspiring writers bloggers and social media influencers to be.

This has really helped all those on the platforms not just with a strong social media presence but also financially 

Farai then extended story untold to Spotify where his doing podcasts and reaching out to different parts of Africa in a quest to hear all the untold stories of Africa as well as educating the listeners 

Farai‚Äôs story teaches us that with hard work resilience passion and dedication and a hand full of innovation you can reach your goals
26/10/23, 13:42 - Jasmine Kaur: You've captured the essence of Farai Mudzingwa's journey and the lessons we can derive from it.
Farai's transition from a journalist at ZIM tech to the creator of Story Untold ZW is a testament to the power of passion, innovation, and hard work. Keep up the good work Stanslous.
26/10/23, 13:51 - Stanslous EWYL23E0653: Thank you üôèüèΩ
26/10/23, 13:56 - Jasmine Kaur: Now, I'd like to discuss our focus for the coming week and the week after. Would you kindly let me know which project you'd prefer to work on, either Community Building or the African Schools Education Reform Mission?
26/10/23, 14:17 - Stanslous EWYL23E0653: Community building
26/10/23, 14:20 - Jasmine Kaur: Great, May I know what all you have been doing so far?
26/10/23, 14:45 - Stanslous EWYL23E0653: Trying to recruit some outgoing students using the forms you gave me 

So now waiting on their responses then I create a group for the interested parties
26/10/23, 14:49 - Jasmine Kaur: May I know how many students have joined your group?
26/10/23, 15:27 - Jasmine Kaur: Stanslous, I trust you comprehend that we have only two sessions per week, and I'd like to see your active participation in these sessions. It's disheartening that we couldn't achieve that today. Please recognize that this might hinder your progress. I look forward to our next session. In the meantime, take care.
26/10/23, 15:35 - Stanslous EWYL23E0653: Same but some of the issues are beyond my control 

Network is a problem here most times messages get here 20 minutes after 

Sometimes I might have personal issues happening here at home 

Then I thought it was Monday and Wednesday so I would have cleared everything for those two exact days for the sessions because I‚Äôm not always free and sitting at home
26/10/23, 15:46 - Jasmine Kaur: I appreciate your understanding, but I'd like to clarify that our sessions are held on Monday and Thursday, spanning from 9:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. Additionally, you should come into the Line on Wednesdays and Saturdays to request your Lessons and activities.

30/10/23, 14:02 - Jasmine Kaur: Stanislous, the initial message is quite lengthy. Would you consider dividing it into 2-3 shorter messages? This way, we can engage in a more organized conversation with the students before we request them to complete the student application form.
30/10/23, 14:02 - Stanslous EWYL23E0653: Okay noted will change the format on the next one

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.
