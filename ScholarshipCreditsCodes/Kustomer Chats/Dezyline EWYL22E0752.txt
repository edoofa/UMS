26/01/23, 00:19 - Dezyline EWYL22E0752: Okay I shall
26/01/23, 00:43 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Dezyline!
How are you?
26/01/23, 00:46 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
26/01/23, 00:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
26/01/23, 01:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.

26/01/23, 23:42 - Dezyline EWYL22E0752: 8-10
30/01/23, 15:05 - Dezyline EWYL22E0752: I'm a proud edoofian...
30/01/23, 15:05 - Dezyline EWYL22E0752: Maam how are you
30/01/23, 15:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
30/01/23, 15:10 - Dezyline EWYL22E0752: Alright I shall maintain the habit for sure
30/01/23, 21:24 - Dezyline EWYL22E0752: Good day
30/01/23, 21:24 - Dezyline EWYL22E0752: Sorry I'm late but I'm here for the session

02/02/23, 01:19 - Dezyline EWYL22E0752: Alright let me do so
02/02/23, 02:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's connect at your next scheduled session!

Till then please work on your respective project and of course, our amazing Wednesday lesson.
We will discuss them in your next session.
Till then, have a great day?
02/02/23, 03:44 - Dezyline EWYL22E0752: Same
02/02/23, 15:10 - Dezyline EWYL22E0752: I'll be doing it today
02/02/23, 18:41 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Dezyline!
How are you?
02/02/23, 18:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' for today.
02/02/23, 18:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
02/02/23, 18:43 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
02/02/23, 18:43 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, I hope you are working on your Wednesday lesson and Company Connect project.
04/02/23, 02:14 - Dezyline EWYL22E0752: Maam how are you
04/02/23, 02:14 - Dezyline EWYL22E0752: The link you sent to go on the website is not working too well
04/02/23, 21:26 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Dezyline!

04/02/23, 21:26 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me reshare the link with you.

04/02/23, 21:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, can I please have your Wednesday lesson understanding?
04/02/23, 21:28 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, I have tried to make the Corporate Alliances project very much easier for you :fireworks: 
Let me share an audio for you that highlights the IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROJECT
05/02/23, 19:32 - Dezyline EWYL22E0752: Okay I will try opening
06/02/23, 17:26 - Dezyline EWYL22E0752: Morning maam
06/02/23, 17:26 - Dezyline EWYL22E0752: I'm a very proud edoofian
06/02/23, 17:26 - Dezyline EWYL22E0752: Maam it's not opening but the audio I heard it
06/02/23, 17:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian, Let me share a small story with you!                                                                                                                                                                                       Ready??                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
06/02/23, 17:29 - Dezyline EWYL22E0752: That's very true maam I shall follow these two things through my journey
06/02/23, 21:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
