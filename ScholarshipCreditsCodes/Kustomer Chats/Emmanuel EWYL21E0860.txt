15/07/22, 18:43 - Unknown: Proud Edoofian, In the past few days, I have observed that we have started to deviate from the goals that we wanted to achieve when we started our *EWYL Program*. ?
The only reason for this is the lack of connectivity.
15/07/22, 18:44 - Unknown: My system shows that you haven't worked on the EWYL Projects since May 2022.
Is this true?
15/07/22, 18:58 - Emmanuel EWYL21E0860: Yes Sir
15/07/22, 18:58 - Emmanuel EWYL21E0860: True.
15/07/22, 19:34 - Unknown: Emmanuel, May I know what do you want to acheive from the EWYL Program?
15/07/22, 19:35 - Emmanuel EWYL21E0860: I need credits to lower my fees
15/07/22, 20:21 - Unknown: And How can we acheive that, Emmanuel?
25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:07 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off
