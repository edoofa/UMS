07/07/23, 18:11 - Sandra EWYL22EO637: Ok maam
08/07/23, 14:06 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

Its time for our Saturday Activity, I want you to delve into the realm of inspiration and write a detailed essay about a person whom you know personally and who embodies the remarkable trait of consistency. This individual has consistently demonstrated their dedication, determination, and unwavering commitment, becoming a true source of inspiration for you.

In your essay, please explore the key aspects of their life, experiences, and actions that exemplify their consistent nature. Describe how their consistent approach has positively influenced and impacted not only their own life but also the lives of those around them. Reflect on specific instances or situations where their consistent behavior or mindset has motivated you to strive for excellence or overcome challenges in your own life.

Feel free to include personal anecdotes, observations, or conversations that highlight the impact this person's consistency has had on your growth and development. Additionally, analyze the qualities, values, or strategies that you believe contribute to their ability to maintain consistency over time.
I am excited to read your insightful essays and learn about the inspiring individuals who have demonstrated the power of consistency.
Best regards,
Team EWYL

How are you today?
01/08/23, 15:44 - Sandra EWYL22EO637: I'm doing fine
01/08/23, 15:45 - Ananya: I'm absolutely filled with emotions today! Our first batch of 2023 students arrived yesterday morning, and it has been an incredibly busy and overwhelming experience. Meeting these new students for the first time was beyond words, I cannot describe the feeling adequately. I'm now even more thrilled to meet you too! Don't forget to watch the video I'm sharing below; it captures the excitement and enthusiasm we're all experiencing!🌻

01/08/23, 15:46 - Sandra EWYL22EO637: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

01/08/23, 15:47 - Sandra EWYL22EO637: Ok nice and l have watched
01/08/23, 15:48 - Ananya: ou know, the students were so happy that we clicked a lot of pictures. I also made a very cute boomerang of my students holding the care package by Edoofa! Let me show you!
01/08/23, 15:49 - Sandra EWYL22EO637: Ok waiting

01/08/23, 15:51 - Sandra EWYL22EO637: Wooow l have seen it can't wait to be there also
01/08/23, 15:53 - Ananya: On that note, how are your preparations going?
01/08/23, 15:54 - Sandra EWYL22EO637: Almost done tomorrow lm going to submit my visa application papers at the Embassy
01/08/23, 15:56 - Ananya: Amazing Sandra! So are you excited?
01/08/23, 15:56 - Sandra EWYL22EO637: I am very very excited
01/08/23, 15:58 - Ananya: That's lovely! You know, yesterday I noticed that some students were wearing warm clothing, and when they arrived here, the heat was causing them trouble. So, I would recommend you to wear a jacket over a light top. This way, when you land here in India, you can easily remove the jacket and feel more comfortable.
01/08/23, 15:59 - Sandra EWYL22EO637: Ok thank you so much l will do so
01/08/23, 16:01 - Ananya: You know, recently we had a meeting with Angad Sir, and as a whole team, we were planning to introduce some external projects! I'm sharing this information with my students early because these external projects will be considered as valuable experience when they pursue their future dream jobs!
These projects will only be offered to students who have excelled in the EWYL journey and previous projects, as they demonstrate dedication and consistency. So, I think it's essential for us to start preparing as soon as possible. Together, we will brainstorm creative ways to maintain our positive reputation and excellent record. What are your thoughts on this?
01/08/23, 16:03 - Sandra EWYL22EO637: That's a very good idea maam
01/08/23, 16:06 - Ananya: Indeed, last year when students came to India, only well-performing students were offered some amazing projects and had the opportunity to work with renowned brands like Sirona!
Therefore, I want you to be proactive and consistent with your EWYL projects so that you can uphold your reputation in the EWYL department. This way, when an external project comes up, your name will immediately come to mind as a top candidate. Keep up the hard work, and you'll create more opportunities for yourself in the future!
01/08/23, 16:23 - Sandra EWYL22EO637: Ok ok very well understood
01/08/23, 16:25 - Ananya: So what are your plans about this?
