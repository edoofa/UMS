"Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm." - Winston S. Churchill

Meaning: This quote encourages a resilient mindset. It highlights that success often involves facing failures but maintaining enthusiasm and determination throughout the journey. How are you doing today? Ready to navigate the path to success with resilience and enthusiasm?
30/11/23, 15:29 - Thandekile EWYL23E0495: I'm doing well and ready
30/11/23, 15:38 - Unknown: Okay great, Thandekile.
30/11/23, 15:39 - Unknown: Before we move forward, I would like you to submit your understanding of the Wednesday Lesson.
30/11/23, 15:47 - Thandekile EWYL23E0495: The Wednesday lesson was all about me acquiring skills which are not part of the curriculum that is Firstly I have to understand the task given 
Secondly assess the inputs that i can use to perform the task.
Thirdly plan on how I'm going to get to the output 
Lastly I have to proof read my output so as to make sure I did all that was required .This will enable me to learn from my mistakes if i don't do well .
30/11/23, 15:53 - Unknown: Your summary of the Wednesday lesson reflects a clear understanding of  the key skills emphasized. Breaking down tasks into understanding,  assessing inputs, planning for output, and proofreading demonstrates a  systematic and thorough approach. Learning from mistakes is a crucial  aspect of personal and professional growth. Keep applying these steps,  and if you have any questions or need further guidance, feel free to  reach out.
30/11/23, 15:53 - Unknown: Let's also explore the progress of the projects you've been actively engaged in. Let's start with the Community Building Project.

04/12/23, 15:41 - Unknown: I am glad to hear that.
04/12/23, 15:41 - Thandekile EWYL23E0495: Task :Project 2.Community building
Inputs :Finding students from my former schools which  I have learnt from . Using Social media to connect with people eg Whatsapp and Instagram.
Process : I managed to connect with almost everyone I knew from different schools . Some did not even respond .Some seemed interested at first then they stop interacting with mee all of a sudden .
Output : I only managed to get one person to enroll he did not give me a challenge.  Most of my peers are optimistic about the outcome of their results that is why they did not show any interest in studying abroad.
What I learnt is perseverance  and to be more social because the circle of people I know is too little  .That is why I struggled in finding students because I was a  stranger to them . They have heard a lot about scams so it was a bit difficult to convince them
04/12/23, 15:41 - Unknown: Now, regarding the Saturday activity , I'm eager to read your response.
I had to share the Saturday Activity on the EWYL group today morning due to technical glitch I was experiencing at my end..

Reflective Learning: Recognizing the need to expand your social circle and acknowledging the challenges you faced indicates a valuable learning experience.

Perseverance: Your ability to persevere despite some initial setbacks is a crucial quality. It's a strength that will serve you well in future endeavors.
04/12/23, 15:44 - Unknown: Constructive Suggestions:
Diversify Communication: Since not everyone responded, consider diversifying your communication methods. Explore additional platforms or methods to reach a wider audience.

Address Concerns Directly: Acknowledge the skepticism people may have due to scams. Address these concerns directly in your outreach, emphasizing the legitimacy and benefits of the Edoofa program.

You are most welcome.
As we embark on today's session, let's kick-start our journey with a dose of inspiration from Jeff Bezos, the visionary founder of Amazon:
Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room

Now, what does this mean to you?

Imagine you're creating your personal brand every day. It's not just about how you see yourself; it's about the impression you leave on others. Whether you're in the classroom, chatting with friends, or pursuing your hobbies, you're shaping your brandâ€”the way people perceive you.
So, let's dive into today's session with the mindset of crafting a brand that reflects your strengths, values, and aspirations. Together, we'll explore ways to amplify your unique qualities and set the stage for success, not just academically, but in every aspect of your lives.
Remember, each interaction, each achievement, contributes to your brand. Let's make it a story of growth, resilience, and positive impact!
