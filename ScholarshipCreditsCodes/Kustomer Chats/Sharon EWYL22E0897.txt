01/04/23, 00:41 - Unknown: Dear Students,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and let you know that I was overwhelmed by the response from students during my recent university visit. While I was thrilled to see so many of my students, I am currently working on performance evaluation of each one of them. Hence I would like to inform you that I will not be able to attend to your queries during the weekend that is tomorrow and day after. 

However, I would like to assure you that I will be available to connect with you in our upcoming session on Monday\/Tuesday. Please make sure you mark your calendars and plan to attend that session so we can address any questions or concerns you may have and proceed with our discussions then.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. I am looking forward to our next session and I hope to see you all there.

Till then take care and don‚Äôt forget to work on your pending activities from this month.","transform":"

01/05/23, 16:25 - Sharon EWYL22E0897: Napoleon Hill has 13 points and last Wednesday we did 6 .those 13 points are desire, faith, auto suggestion, specialized knowledge, imagination, organized planning, decision, persistence, subconscious mind, brain and sixth sense. In desire Hill states that the key to success is to define a goal and pour all your energy, power and efforts into archiving it. To desire riches and not accepting failure as an option and visualising yourself as rich. As a person you can become rich if you posses a deep desire for money. In faith, it is a state of mind that you must learn to cultivate. Through reaping affirmation and instructions, a positive mind is more fertile to faith. Faith is the starting point of success. In auto suggestion which also mean self suggestion. When resisting words of affirmation you must encourage yourself. The fourth is specialized knowledge. It is a personal experience or observation and they are 2 types. The synthetic and creative imagination. Through synthetic you reformulate existing concepts, ideas. The creative imagination brings inspiration and new ideas are formed. In the last aspect of last week we talked about organized planning which is to put your plan into action.

As we embark on a new year, it's the perfect time to reflect on our aspirations and set goals for personal and academic growth. To kick off our Saturday activity, we invite you to share the goals you've set for yourself in the upcoming year, 2024.üéØ

Whether your goals are related to academics, personal development, extracurricular activities, or any other aspect of your life, we want to hear about them! This is a wonderful opportunity for us to inspire and support one another as a community.

Please take a moment to jot down your goals and be prepared to share them during our Saturday activity. It could be something as simple as improving your study habits, achieving a certain grade, learning a new skill, or even fostering better connections with your peers.‚ú®

Remember, setting goals is not only a way to envision your future but also a roadmap to success. By sharing your goals, you might inspire someone else to reach for their dreams as well.
