_Welcome to the first activity of the year!_
As part of today's Saturday activity, we invite you to share your personal experiences from any event you have attended, whether it be a seminar, workshop, or any other gathering. Our Wednesday lesson already highlighted the skills and experiences we can gain by our active participation in events that are aimed at sharing the Industry experience with young students.

Please take a moment to reflect on the event you attended, and share the key learnings, observations, and any memorable moments. Feel free to include pictures that capture the essence of the event.

For those who haven't had the chance to attend any events yet, don't worry! We encourage you to share your expectations from such gatherings. What do you hope to gain? What are your goals and aspirations when attending future events? This is a chance for you to articulate your thoughts and set intentions for your learning journey.

Remember, everyone's perspective is valuable, and by sharing our experiences, we create a supportive community that thrives on collaboration and shared knowledge. Let's make this Saturday activity a meaningful and insightful exchange of experiences and expectations. Thank you for your active participation!

06/01/24, 23:35 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0955: When I attend to a certain gathering for example workshop ,I expect that everyone in company should contribute if there is need and with accordance to an event like serminar , different teams or individuals gather to pour out their views and understanding so I expect everyone to take part so that everyone benefits.
At workshops I would also expect that everyone has something to say after the meeting which benefits him/her and also the society depending on the aim of the meeting.

11/01/24, 13:10 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0955: Good morning team EWYL
11/01/24, 13:15 - Aditi Kapoor: Good Morning!

Hope you have been well, I missed our sessions a lotü•∫, and I am happy to be back for our sessions, I will share the pictures of the visit with you shortly in your EWYL group, okay?ü§ù
So are you ready for today's session?üöÄ
11/01/24, 13:16 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0955: Yes I am ready
11/01/24, 13:24 - Aditi Kapoor: Superb!
So let's begin with how your projects are going.
11/01/24, 13:30 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0955: Okay ,they are promising though the students are a bit hard to convince.
It is said don't lose hope on what you really want to achieve by some authors.
11/01/24, 13:37 - Aditi Kapoor: I understand that you are facing the challenge of convincing students, possibly in an educational or motivational context. The idea of not losing hope aligns with the encouragement often provided by authors who emphasize perseverance and determination in the pursuit of one's goals.
When dealing with students, it's essential to understand that each individual may have unique concerns, motivations, and perspectives. Effective communication, empathy, and providing tangible examples of success stories can be powerful tools in convincing students to embrace new ideas or approaches.
11/01/24, 13:44 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0955: Definitely yes
11/01/24, 13:55 - Aditi Kapoor: Awesome!
11/01/24, 13:57 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0955: üòä
11/01/24, 13:57 - Aditi Kapoor: Also, your perspective on gatherings like workshops and seminars resonates with a collaborative and inclusive approach, which is commendable. It's evident that you value active participation and contributions from everyone involved. The belief that each individual's input adds value not only to their personal growth but also to the collective benefit of society aligns with the essence of such events. Maintaining an open and participatory mindset in such settings enhances the overall effectiveness of workshops and seminars, turning them into valuable platforms for knowledge exchange and community enrichment
11/01/24, 14:03 - Ropafadzo EWYL23E0955: Thank you ma'am üòä
11/01/24, 14:10 - Aditi Kapoor: You're welcome!
