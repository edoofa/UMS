26/10/22, 18:58 - Tapiwa EWYL22E0090: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Tapiwa and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Tapiwa EWYL22E0090
27/10/22, 21:30 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Tapiwa!
How are you?
28/10/22, 00:08 - Tapiwa EWYL22E0090: I am a proud Edoofian!
Greetings of the day
28/10/22, 00:10 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

How did your weekend go?

This weekend's activity gave you a first-hand experience to fit yourselves in a small part of the leadership shoes. I wanted you to create a newsletter of your own. Similar to the ones you have enjoyed reading every Sunday from the founder's office.

In our session, we will discuss:
1) the newsletter that you have designed for the weekend activity
07/11/22, 20:22 - Aditi Kapoor: Along with this, I hope you remember that:

08/11/22, 00:16 - Tapiwa EWYL22E0090: Yes, it's been a while since I have caught the bug, so medicines will likely work after a few days
08/11/22, 00:19 - Tapiwa EWYL22E0090: As lessons have began, using someone's device might be a problem, and l have been talking to my mother and she said she is trying to send the money in due time

Hope you are well.

Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their personality traits made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.

In our session on the EWYL Line, we will discuss:
1) your views on the Wednesday Wisdom
2) Updates on the weekend activity newsletter
10/11/22, 21:45 - Aditi Kapoor: I know your health is not that well, but if you get time, please do consider doing these activities and lessons.
They are very different and interesting this week. :fireworks:

10/11/22, 21:47 - Tapiwa EWYL22E0090: Based on?
10/11/22, 21:48 - Aditi Kapoor: Let me share the activity again with you for better clarity.
10/11/22, 21:49 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Dear Proud Edoofian!

“My job is not to be easy on people. My job is to make them better.”- Steve Jobs

And till now, our founder Mr. Angad has always been a guiding light for everyone at Edoofa. And has made sure we all turn out to be future leaders in our fields, no matter how hard it seems, we should keep moving with single harmony toward our goals and motives. But, leadership can not only be taught, as it is not a literary subject, but a practical life experience that is to be taken up and practiced and bettered with each passing day.

Hence, after the very encouraging Wednesday lesson on how good leadership and patience can change the entire ideology and perception of a community to grow back from the ashes. Today's Activity is going to give you a first-hand experience to fit yourselves in a small part of the leadership shoes. I want you to create a newsletter of your own. Similar to the ones you have enjoyed reading every Sunday from the founder's office.

Your Newsletter should consider the following things:  Quotes that have been motivating you for some time now, or your three favorite quotes which motivate you to be better every day.
and,
2. One story of your idol, that can be any person, who according to you has contributed to making the community and world a better place for people to live. The story should also consist of a part stating the reason why they are your idol.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own capabilities while performing this activity.

The best newsletters of the week shall be shared with all the fellow edoofians next week.

Have a wonderful weekend ahead.
