18/11/23, 16:15 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!

Moving forward you have to submit your lesson response before the beginning of our session. Only then will I move ahead with the session and mark your attendance. If you want, you can submit your response immediately after receiving the activity or lesson.
29/12/23, 19:23 - Ananya: Greetings on this beautiful day!‚ú®

As we embark on a new year, it's the perfect time to reflect on our aspirations and set goals for personal and academic growth. To kick off our Saturday activity, we invite you to share the goals you've set for yourself in the upcoming year, 2024.üéØ

Whether your goals are related to academics, personal development, extracurricular activities, or any other aspect of your life, we want to hear about them! This is a wonderful opportunity for us to inspire and support one another as a community.

Please take a moment to jot down your goals and be prepared to share them during our Saturday activity. It could be something as simple as improving your study habits, achieving a certain grade, learning a new skill, or even fostering better connections with your peers.‚ú®

Remember, setting goals is not only a way to envision your future but also a roadmap to success. By sharing your goals, you might inspire someone else to reach for their dreams as well.

Let's make 2024 a year of growth, achievement, and mutual support. We look forward to hearing about your aspirations during our Saturday activity.ü§ù

03/01/24, 13:37 - Ananya: Good morning Bright! üåû

Let's start the day with a bit of fun and mystery. Here's a riddle for you:
'I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have nobody, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?'
03/01/24, 13:40 - Bright EWYL23E0328: Let me think of the answer !
03/01/24, 13:46 - Bright EWYL23E0328: Is it a wind chime ?
03/01/24, 13:51 - Ananya: No, Bright! That's ECHO!
03/01/24, 13:59 - Bright EWYL23E0328: Ohh yes that's right!üòÇ
03/01/24, 14:03 - Ananya: Well, Bright, as mentioned earlier you were required to submit your activity before the beginning of your session on Friday. It seems you might not have adhered to the guidelines given at the start of the new year. Is this the right way?
03/01/24, 14:19 - Bright EWYL23E0328: No it isn't.
03/01/24, 14:33 - Ananya: I was expecting a response on time, however, since our session time is over, I am wrapping up our session. As you wrap up today's endeavors, remember: 'Believe you can and you're halfway there.' - Theodore Roosevelt. Your efforts today are the foundation for your success tomorrow. Keep pushing forward with confidence and determination. üí™
03/01/24, 14:34 - Bright EWYL23E0328: Thank you for the motivation and my apologies for the late response.
03/01/24, 16:01 - Ananya: _Welcome to the *first Wednesday Lesson* of the year 2024_

11/01/24, 13:09 - Bright EWYL23E0328: International exposure can be a huge benefit for a number of reasons. First, it can give a broader perspective on the world and my field of work. It can also help me build a global network, open up new opportunities, and give me an edge over my competition. Additionally, international exposure can help me develop new skills, knowledge, and experiences that I wouldn't have had otherwise. And finally, it can simply make me more marketable and attractive to potential employers.
11/01/24, 13:39 - Ananya: A lovely morning to you, and kindly excuse me for the short delay. I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.
Not only this, but we also welcomed various industrial leaders, and it went super well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we teach them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. I hope that whenever you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/01/24, 13:44 - Bright EWYL23E0328: Thank you for sharing with me. I wish I could have been there to witness it firsthand too.
11/01/24, 14:00 - Ananya: Indeed, Bright! Let me share a few glimpses of the event with you!
11/01/24, 14:00 - Ananya: .
11/01/24, 14:13 - Bright EWYL23E0328: Thank you.
11/01/24, 14:15 - Bright EWYL23E0328: It seemed awesome.
11/01/24, 14:16 - Bright EWYL23E0328: It was really packed too.
11/01/24, 14:39 - Ananya: Indeed! Now, I know it took me some extra time to find the pictures for you, and our session could not take place. We shall now resume our session on Monday. Meanwhile, I want you to follow your EWYL ritual daily so that you can receive the weekend activity.
Not only this, but since this week is completely off for you, I want to know your progress with your projects. You know, seeing over 400 students in this event has motivated me to work for my students even harder. I want you to be here in India and pay your fee all by yourself. For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed for a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?
11/01/24, 15:01 - Bright EWYL23E0328: Thank you ma'am, I really appreciate your assistance.
12/01/24, 12:59 - Bright EWYL23E0328: I am a proud Edoofian.
