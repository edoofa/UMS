I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.

It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.

30/10/23, 14:01 - Garreth EWYL22E0096: No I don’t
30/10/23, 14:03 - Ananya: Garreth, you were already late, and now you are responding late. It's a 1.5-hour long session, and delays during that will lead to an ineffective session. May I ask if you are facing any challenges?
30/10/23, 14:03 - Garreth EWYL22E0096: I was having network problems
30/10/23, 14:03 - Garreth EWYL22E0096: My apologies
30/10/23, 14:05 - Ananya: Alright, before sharing a glimpse of an amazing AI tool, I wanted to ask if you were able to connect with your school head?
30/10/23, 14:07 - Garreth EWYL22E0096: No, he said the school is a cluster centre for exams so currently he’s busy
30/10/23, 14:10 - Ananya: Alright, have you tried asking him to reschedule your meeting post-examinations?
30/10/23, 14:13 - Garreth EWYL22E0096: He just said he’ll let me know
30/10/23, 14:14 - Garreth EWYL22E0096: Hopefully, he will
30/10/23, 14:22 - Ananya: Alright, Garreth! Meanwhile, may I ask if you have the contact information for any other school heads?
30/10/23, 14:30 - Garreth EWYL22E0096: No, not yet
30/10/23, 14:33 - Ananya: Alright, by our next session, I'd like you to search for some school head's contact numbers so that we can reach out to them. There are several ways to do this. You can start by reaching out to your Headmaster at school, with whom you were close, and ask him/her for other School Head's contact information. Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates, peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head's contact details.
30/10/23, 14:34 - Ananya: Meanwhile, as promised, here is the video for an amazing AI tool that's going to help you in your career as a graphic designer. Good luck! You're going to love it! 🚀

How are you doing today?
02/11/23, 13:05 - Garreth EWYL22E0096: I’m all good and you?
02/11/23, 13:15 - Ananya: Well, Garreth, this week's Wednesday lesson was about Journaling and Its Benefits. I am quite interested to hear your thoughts on this topic! Would you like to share your thoughts with me? 📓💭
02/11/23, 13:27 - Garreth EWYL22E0096: Well i think journaling is really helpful in many aspects of self development considering how as humans we tend to forget yesterday’s thoughts, events or feelings so if something is written down, depending on one’s brevity, it can give a vivid picture of the changes in self growth
02/11/23, 13:28 - Ananya: You're absolutely right! Journaling is an invaluable tool for self-development, as it helps us capture our thoughts, events, and feelings over time. It serves as a personal record that reflects our journey and growth. The act of writing things down can provide clarity and insight into our own progress, making it easier to see how we've evolved and what areas of self-improvement we can focus on. Keep up the great practice of journaling—it's a powerful means of self-reflection and growth! 📓🌱🌟
02/11/23, 13:48 - Garreth EWYL22E0096: That’s true
02/11/23, 13:50 - Ananya: Now, may I ask if you managed to find the contact information of any school head?
02/11/23, 13:55 - Garreth EWYL22E0096: No, every school has got exams in progress so I realized how most school heads are occupied but they are finishing this month so that’s when i might be able to get some contacts
02/11/23, 13:57 - Ananya: Alright, let's do this. I can see that you're putting in a lot of effort, so how about we split the work? I'll share the names of some schools in your province that are not connected with us, and your part will be to find their contact numbers. Let's collaborate and work together on this.
02/11/23, 14:00 - Garreth EWYL22E0096: I agree
02/11/23, 14:12 - Ananya: Alright, can you please confirm your province?
02/11/23, 14:12 - Garreth EWYL22E0096: Harare
02/11/23, 14:18 - Ananya: Lomagundi College
Peterhouse Boys' School
Chisipite Senior School 
Prince Edward School
02/11/23, 14:27 - Garreth EWYL22E0096: Okay
02/11/23, 14:32 - Ananya: Great, now let us conclude our session here. I hope you will be able to find the contact details of these school heads. Meanwhile, I am sharing our weekly newsletter with you.

As part of your Saturday Activity, I encourage each one of you to dedicate some time to journaling for just one day. Let your thoughts flow freely onto the pages, expressing your feelings, ideas, and observations. Take this opportunity to delve deep within yourself and discover what truly matters to you. Your journal can be a canvas for your dreams, fears, aspirations, and daily experiences. When sharing your journal, feel free to discuss your insights, challenges, and any personal growth you may have experienced through the process.

I believe that this activity will not only enhance your writing skills but also nurture your emotional intelligence and self-awareness. I look forward to reading and discussing your journal entries during our upcoming session. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Happy journaling!
