How are you?
23/10/23, 13:45 - Saloni Rastogi: Please note that I won't be available today due to some personal commitments. On Tuesday, our services will not be operational as we will be observing Dussehra, an exciting Indian festival celebrated with grand effigies, fireworks, and vibrant processions that symbolize the victory of good over evil. 🎉 Dussehra is a dazzling spectacle of lights, dances, and traditions that bring families and communities together while also paying tribute to the epic triumph of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana. 🏹🔥
23/10/23, 13:45 - Saloni Rastogi: Dussehra is a Hindu festival with its origins in India, celebrating the victory of good over evil. It is not directly linked to African festivals but shares the universal theme of triumph over malevolence. In diverse African communities, individuals from India or other regions may celebrate Dussehra alongside local festivities, fostering cultural exchange. Immigrants from India in Africa often continue to observe Dussehra, occasionally sharing these traditions with their local communities. While not intrinsically connected, Dussehra's theme of celebrating virtue resonates with the broader notion of triumph over evil found in various African festivals.

I am pleased to observe that a majority of you comprehended well, the message  that was conveyed in this week's Wednesday wisdom. It brought me great joy to go through student’s perspectives on wealth creation and the mindset essential for embarking on this path.

I have a special Saturday assignment for you. The objective of this assignment is to help you understand the steps you can take to prepare yourself for wealth creation. The assignment will encourage you to identify their goals, develop a financial plan, and cultivate the mindset and habits needed to achieve financial success.

Here are some instructions to make it easy for you to work on this assignment:
1. Goal Setting: The first step towards wealth creation is to set clear and achievable goals. In this section, write down your short-term and long-term financial goals. Explain how each goal will contribute to your overall financial success.
2. Financial Planning: A financial plan is a roadmap that outlines how you will achieve your financial goals. In this section, develop a comprehensive financial plan that includes strategies for budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management. Identify the resources you will need to achieve your financial plan and explain how you will access them.
3. Mindset and Habits: Wealth creation is not just about having a financial plan; it is also about cultivating the mindset and habits that will help you achieve your goals. In this section, identify the mindset and habits that are necessary for financial success. Explain how you will cultivate these qualities in yourself and develop strategies to overcome any obstacles that may arise.
4. Conclusion: In this section, summarize your findings and discuss the importance of preparing yourself for wealth creation. Reflect on what you have learned throughout the assignment and discuss how you will apply these principles in your own life.

26/03/23, 19:53 - Ivy EWYL22E1298: 1. Short term goals 
Tackle debt. Debt grows so the quicker  you pay it down the less money you will spent on interest. This can help you free up money towards your other financial goals. Create a budget .improve your budget over time until  it  works for you. Check on it each month or week to see which spending categories you are struggling to stick with. Regularly checking in also can help you be more mindful of the purchases you make .Save for emergencies, An emergency fund lets you stash away money in case an unexpected expense or loss of income comes your way .Most  experts recommend building up enough money to cover three  to six months to your expenses. This cache can help you avoid turning to expensive alternatives like credit cards and personal loan.Learn more about personal finance.The more informed you are, the more comfortable you will likely feel when making financial decisions .Take your financial  education into your own hands .Read financial books and articles , enroll in free or low cost online or local financial courses or reach out to financial advisors.Make room for fun, start with little changes .Not using a streaming services as  often as you thought you would cancel it and direct the monthly fee towards a travel fund instead.

27/03/23, 21:05 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

As informed earlier, I was not available last week from Thursday to Friday and the organization was closed on Saturday and Sunday. So let's focus today's session solely on these two things:

1) Wednesday lesson + Weekend activity understanding
2) Project Updates

Also, this week will be visiting our _Proud Indian Edoofians_ from Wednesday to Saturday. So, the sessions will be held at that time. And I will be very happy to share the updates of our visit with you as the days go by?
27/03/23, 21:07 - Saloni Rastogi: You have summed up your understanding really well, it reflects a lot of maturity and aspiration to excel in life.
I have read in-depth all your responses and I am glad to say that you have got the trucks of the lesson and activities super well. ✨
27/03/23, 21:08 - Saloni Rastogi: So may I know Ivy if your school is connected with Edoofa or not?
27/03/23, 21:35 - Ivy EWYL22E1298: Okay ma'am
27/03/23, 21:36 - Ivy EWYL22E1298: They have not replied my email yet

27/03/23, 22:23 - Saloni Rastogi: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

27/03/23, 22:42 - Ivy EWYL22E1298: It's not
27/03/23, 22:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Proud Edoofian, TODAY, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
27/03/23, 22:43 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead tomorrow.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him\/her for your School Head’s Contact.

28/03/23, 20:19 - Ivy EWYL22E1298: Okay
29/03/23, 00:59 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for the delayed response, I was occupied in an internal meeting with the team with was to be attended as a priority about our visit starting tomorrow till Saturday.
As informed, no sessions will be held during this time and we will begin afresh from next week onwards where I will be sharing some crazy and interesting insights with you.
But this will only be done, we you will NOT MISS these *THREE THINGS*:
1) Timely submission of the Wednesday lesson and weekend activity
2) Daily following the ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', the absence of which can lead to not sharing of weekly lessons and activities with you
3) and most importantly, *PROGRESS ON PROJECTS*

I will be tracking the progress on _Monday_.
I completely know that these two weeks, we might not have dedicated discussions on the projects. So in my absence, I want that you think in-depth about *the project you are doing, revising the targets for the same, and completing it*.
I would really be emotional and happy that in a few months, many of the new edoofians will be joining our Indian family here. And honestly, I will be happier that we start preparing now for the future because growth is not measured in one day. We need to work hard consistently and dedicatedly.

Like I always say ‘1 step daily means 1 step UP. 0 step daily means 1 step DOWN’.
I trust you, just believe in yourself.
