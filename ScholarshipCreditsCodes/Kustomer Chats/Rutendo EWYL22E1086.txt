15/05/23, 21:43 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am RUTENDO TAFIREYI and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Rutendo EWYL 22E1086
18/05/23, 15:30 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: *I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN*
18/05/23, 15:30 - Ananya: `- That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!`

`- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.``- How do you intend to broaden this student community? 

In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.
18/05/23, 15:32 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: I will coorporate,work hard and focus so that l can achieve my goals.
18/05/23, 15:34 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: And l am ready for the Today's session!üí´
18/05/23, 16:59 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: *I am a proud Edoofian*
18/05/23, 16:59 - Ananya: `- That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!`

`- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.``- How do you intend to broaden this student community? 

In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.
18/05/23, 17:20 - Ananya: Kindly share your Wednesday lesson understanding with me here!
18/05/23, 17:21 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Ok maam ,I learnt about the leadership skills that edoofa team is witness to, this include Servant leadership, l understood that Servant
leadership is a leadership philosophy in which the goal of the leader is to serve,l noted that A
servant leader shares power, puts the needs of the employees first and helps people develop and perform ashighly as possible. Instead of the people working to serve the leader, the leader exists to serve the people. And it was said that this type is different from other forms of leadership where the leader's main focus is the thriving of their company or organization.

Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh, the Edoofa
program's founders had exemplified this type of leadership in the Covid pandemic era,They showed thier strong leadership, despite adversities, theymade sure that the team was taken care of, be it paying salaries on time, or calls of reassurance thattogether will overcome this difficult time.

Last but not least l have learnt the characteristics of servant leaders and each of these traits can be found in Mr Angad Singh and Mr Avreen Singh , these include; Listening to the people you lead, Empathy in understanding others viewpoints and not focussing on what you only think, Healing that is supporting the people you lead both emotionally or physically, Self Awareness, Must have good Persuasion skills,Conceptualization that is they dream big, Foresight of wat might likely happen and get ready for consequences of their decisions , Stewardship thus they take responsibility for their actions, Commitment to the growth of people, and Building community.
18/05/23, 17:21 - Ananya: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the Wednesday lesson. It is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.
18/05/23, 17:22 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Yes sure.
18/05/23, 17:23 - Ananya: Let us reconnect in our next session !
18/05/23, 17:24 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Ok noted
21/05/23, 17:33 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: *I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN*
21/05/23, 17:33 - Ananya: `- That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!`

`- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.``- How do you intend to broaden this student community? 

In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor. Namaste
21/05/23, 17:36 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: *Ms Ananya here is my submission of my weakened assignment*

I can use the EWYL programme to master the skill of leadership in many ways like practicing to improve my communication skills, admiting when l fail and move on, and having discipline, were l must strictly obey rules or a code of behaviour needed to be a successful Edoofian, and also l must take on more time doing my projects and become more determined to produce a positive result ,and also l must develop a great way to take on more responsibility on the assignments given to me by my mentors and l must always learn to follow what is being instructed and develop situational awareness and inspire others about how good the EWYL programme is and always l must keep learning from my mentors.

I mostly like to be a leader in the Corporate Alliance project,followed by Community building, lastly the African schools education reform mission.

To ensure that my name is on the next list of student leaders for the Edoofa student community l am supposed to perform better on the projects that are assigned to me by my EWYL mentors, l must identify my strengths and weaknesses and work toward improving my strengths and try to curtail my weaknesses,I must follow all the skills that l am being taught and demonstrate them to improve my eligibility, and l must brush up on my hard skills, determine my goals and work hard toward achieving them, l must develop awareness and foresight, and most importantly working on my communication skills, and  l must have empathy and diplomacy.
25/05/23, 15:28 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: *I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN*

25/05/23, 15:35 - Ananya: A lovely good morning to my Proud Edoofian! 

On this Africa Day, I would like to extend my heartfelt wishes to you. As students, you are the future leaders, innovators, and change-makers who will shape Africa's destiny.üåü

25/05/23, 15:45 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Thankyou thankyou, ma'am Happy Africa day
25/05/23, 15:46 - Ananya: So, Rutendo what are your plans for celebrating Africa day today?
25/05/23, 15:48 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: I have no plans ma'am,except staying home and browsing through social media and seeing what others are doing with this day ma'am.
25/05/23, 15:50 - Ananya: Why, you should also go out Rutendo!
25/05/23, 15:52 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Yea sure ma'am, that's actually a good idea,so l an actually thinking of contacting my friends and plan what we shall do todayüí´
25/05/23, 15:55 - Ananya: Many o my students are dressing up in their traditional outfits, cooking great African food and some are even visiting the church!
25/05/23, 15:57 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Wowüí´this is nice ma'am...,l like cooking too..
25/05/23, 15:58 - Ananya: Perfect, so why don't you make something delicious for yourself?
25/05/23, 16:00 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: üëèüëèüëèüëèl like that idea...l will definitely do so .
25/05/23, 16:01 - Ananya: Great. So, were you able to read the Wednesday lesson?
25/05/23, 16:02 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Yes sure ma'am,l have read it and understood it
25/05/23, 16:02 - Ananya: That is wonderful, so would you like to share your thoughts on it?
25/05/23, 16:07 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: I have learnt that one must be self aware of his or herself,you must know what you are made of and what you are capable of,hence for you to be productive,and from the Life of Barack Obama l have learnt how introversion and how timr management had led to his success.

And also from this l want also to share some of my strength and weakness as instructed to be done.
25/05/23, 16:07 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: For me to be productive on daily basis l have got a list of strengths and characteristic traits which helps me through the day, these include the following; l am adaptive to the environment l will be working on, l am flexible to new changes and l am optimistic, l am cooperative l found it easy to work with others,l am punctual and self motivated,l have laser-like focus,and l tend to arm myself with the right tools needed at that specific time, l protect my priorities, l am conscious of what l want to achieve in my life hence this gives me a better productivity when l am home ,so when ever l found time l sit with my self and medidate on how l am going to achieve my personal goals, l am open, l am more willing to listen to multiple viewpoints and always try to do new things, l am observant and submissively attentive to any rules that l should operate within, l am savvy ,l am a risk- taker,l am energetic ,creative and highly organised, l am also passionate about my life , ambitious and driven, l know what is important and plan my day ,l prioritise my daily routines, whenever l am left behind l am able to get back on track faster, and l am a problem solver.

Regardless of those listed above l have got a list of personality traits which are a hindrance to my daily productivity, these include the following; l am impatient that is whenever l am trying to work online and during the process then face challenges like network and communication problems l easily quit what l will be doing that moment but l am currently working toward trying to be a little more patient, l am sensitive to the behavior of people surrounding me that is whenever l will be trying to work hard then someone keeps on disturbing me l lose focus and become easily moved to the extent that l will not become productive but slowly and surely l am working upon improving my focus so that l can not get easily affected by external forces, l cant say *"No"* when someone asks for help,so l end up helping those people hence slowing down my productivity, Sometimes l tend to overthink on an issue like when doing a project then it doesn't work the way l was expecting it to do l see my self being incarcerated by my thoughts and  l will find rest whenever l have solved that troubling issue.
25/05/23, 16:08 - Ananya: I agree with the sentiment expressed in your statement about self-awareness. Our Wednesday wisdom emphasized the importance of being honest with one's feelings and taking time for self-reflection. For instance, former President Obama dedicated 4-5 hours of his time alone after dinner, which allowed him to delve deeper into self-discovery.
25/05/23, 16:10 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: And l mostly noted that,If Obama who had so much on his plate almost every day,could do it just by identifying with his personality type and
using his strengths to create history so can l do the same and become successful
25/05/23, 16:12 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Yes sure ma'am
25/05/23, 16:14 - Ananya: Yes, indeed.
25/05/23, 16:19 - Ananya: Now, I believe that you are now aware of how to find the companies, am I right?
25/05/23, 16:19 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Yes sure ma'am l am aware of that..
25/05/23, 16:22 - Ananya: Great, so can I expect 5 companies from you per week?
25/05/23, 16:25 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Yes sure ma'am l can do that,but now l am still waiting for a list of companies that l have sent to you to be verified then l can find a way on how l may contact the decision makers
25/05/23, 16:27 - Ananya: You do not have to contact them, our team will contact them and then you will earn the credits. It is easier for you to just search for the company and building resources for the team.
25/05/23, 16:27 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Okey okey,noted l will surely do so Ma'am.
25/05/23, 16:29 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: If its not for me to contact them,what l will be able to find its the company email, description , LinkedIn profile,website,,,will this  information be enough,or other contact for decision makers will still be required...
25/05/23, 16:33 - Ananya: This information will be enough!
25/05/23, 16:36 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Okey ma'am l will proudly do so....
25/05/23, 16:37 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: So please if l may ask have you noted the previous information of the companies l have sent?
25/05/23, 16:38 - Ananya: Yes, we did.
25/05/23, 16:38 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Ok sure ma'am, thankyou
25/05/23, 16:41 - Ananya: Great, now let us move forward with the community building project!
25/05/23, 16:43 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: That one ,l am putting more effort but its like my work is in vain,l am sharing the link but few people are coming.
25/05/23, 16:47 - Ananya: I understand, that is why I am here to help!
25/05/23, 16:48 - Ananya: May I ask if you have a facebook account?
25/05/23, 16:52 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Engaging with more students l am trying my best, explaining to them about edoofa l am good at that,the problem is that many of them just dislike the program and most of my mates are enrolled in Zimbabwe here,so that's my issue its difficult to find people
25/05/23, 16:53 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Yes sure ma'am l have it,even an Instagram account
25/05/23, 16:53 - Ananya: Wonderful, There, search for 'Zimbabwe student community' on Facebook. Numerous groups will appear, where you can share the link to the group along with a brief description of the EDOOFA scholarship program.
25/05/23, 16:55 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Ok sure ma'am, that's what l have been doing, searching for groups and sharing, thankyou l will continue doing it...
25/05/23, 16:57 - Ananya: Great, now may I know if you were able to search for the different schools?
25/05/23, 16:57 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Yes sure ma'am,l have
25/05/23, 16:58 - Ananya: Great, so did you manage to connect with them on LinkedIn ?
25/05/23, 17:04 - Ananya: Our session for today has come to an end. Your enthusiasm and curiosity have been truly motivating, and I am confident that you will bring the same level of energy and passion to our upcoming session on Saturday and I am excited to announce that it is going to be a video session. I will share the link with you shortly.
25/05/23, 17:05 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Yes and still waiting for responses,and lf l manage to get the phone numbers of the headmasters,the problem remains the same,most of them are not interested they just blue tick, and not even respond to the follow up message
25/05/23, 17:07 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Ok noted thanks ma'am
25/05/23, 17:08 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Indeed it was a day filled with pure fun and excitement ü•∞
25/05/23, 17:08 - Ananya: I understand, Rutendo! You can give them a phone call.
25/05/23, 17:09 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Will try that
05/06/23, 15:57 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: I am a proud edoofian
05/06/23, 15:57 - Ananya:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, Let me share a small story with you!
 Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came. 
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.
The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell: 

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. 
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above  
05/06/23, 16:00 - Ananya: Rutendo! May I ask why are you late for your session?
05/06/23, 16:01 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Good afternoon ma'am,l am travelling so ,l wasn't able to send messages,sorry ma'am for this!

05/06/23, 16:09 - Ananya: Indeed, Rutendo! Team work is a real success!

05/06/23, 17:25 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Thankyou
05/06/23, 17:29 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: through this newsletter maam , l have gained a deeper understanding that one can become a hero by providing help and support to others in need. This can be achieved by listening to their concerns and motivating them by sharing inspiring stories of people who have overcome similar challenges. Additionally, showing empathy, and kindness, and celebrating their successes can boost their morale and sense of social connection. Small acts of kindness and support can make a significant difference in someone's life and can make me a hero to them.
05/06/23, 17:33 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: And also l understood, that , you can wear the hat of a hero by being there for someone who needs help, listening to their concerns, and providing support and encouragement when they need it. You can also inspire and motivate them by sharing stories of people who have overcome challenges similar to theirs and have achieved success. Additionally, you can improve their morale and boost feelings of social connectedness by showing empathy, being kind, and celebrating their successes with them. Small acts of kindness and support can make a big difference in someone's life and can make you their hero.
12/06/23, 15:10 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: *I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN*
12/06/23, 15:10 - Ananya: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

12/06/23, 15:10 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: Here is the assignment which l hadn't submitted ma'am
12/06/23, 15:10 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086: To deepen my relationship with edoofa l have to be trustworthy that is when l am being trusted or if l have trust with my team members l can be open enough and be honest in my thoughts and actions, and also l must have self awareness so that l opt to know how will l react to my mantles and others who wants to join edoofa so that they may have a fealing to br part of the family,so l have to examine myself first and know that if l am also and introvert or an extrovert then start to work best regarding on what l have discovered who l am, and also l must have inclusion that is in most of the activities to be done by the edoofa community l must also be a part of those activities as this will give me a fealing of belonging and strengthen the connection l have with the community like what l did during the Meet and greet session in Harare l qas part of the coordinators ,this gave me a strong connection with other Edoofians and the leadership of the community and l must  have open communication so that every member knows l am honest and ready to stay part if thr Edoofa family.

This l always do,l always motivate my friends to do the same and know the importance of this connection,l always notify my friends to be honest with them and don't lie about what they feel about this relationship, l tell them not to hesitate to acknowledge how they appreciate this friendship and support, and tell them yo know when to apologize and admit if they were wrong, and always accept and acknowledge the differences we have and let them teach each new things.

Moreover to build a better and stronger Edoofa student community l am trying to understand my strengths and weaknesses then work towards improving them so that when other people see me they will appreciate to be part of the community,l schedule time to develop relationships with other students and explain to them what Edoofa is all about ,l also ask questions and listen so that l clear all my doubts and work knowing that l am in a real family, l offer assistance to those that require it, l know when to ask for assistance so that l always stay in track, and l appreciate each mentir's ir Counselors role when they will be assisting me, and l keep my commitments and try to be present in all of my seeions.

Your commitment to understanding your strengths and weaknesses and actively working on improving them is truly commendable. By doing so, you are setting an inspiring example for others and contributing to the overall growth of our community.

Your readiness to offer assistance to those in need and your understanding of when to seek help demonstrate your commitment to personal growth and staying on the right track.

Furthermore, your appreciation for the role of mentors and counselors in assisting you is admirable. It reflects your gratitude for their guidance and support, and it further strengthens the bond within our Edoofa family.
