18/11/23, 14:47 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!

20/11/23, 16:33 - Cloudious EWYL22E0796: My story goes like this when I was doing my Advanced Level there was a shortage of textbooks at our School so we were asked to buy laptops.  By that time we failed to raise the amount of buying laptop. Because of that situation I evaluate the purpose of laptop and I observed that my smartphone can do it. Finally I use my smartphone to keep those textbooks and other stuff that was supposed to be kept in laptop

Some students were laughing at me(you know at school we meet students with different characters) just because I was using cellphone instead of laptop but I  wasn't disappointed and I ignore them because I was looking forward to achieve my goal so that I can fulfill my dreams.

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

25/11/23, 19:38 - Cloudious EWYL22E0796: Good afternoon Ms 
Iam doing good

From our last lesson I understand the important of competitive spirit. Competitive spirit encourages a person to think outside the box which promotes economic growth and rapid innovation. Due to competitive spirit an individual develops the ability to overcome challenges for example most athletes succeed in their sport field due competitive spirit like Michael Jordan's.
25/11/23, 19:38 - Cloudious EWYL22E0796: Now I do not have projects since we never discuss about them. From our last discussion in my EWYL group (Cloudious EWYL22E0796) you asked me to share my Facebook and Instagram username and my smiling photo and I share.
25/11/23, 22:22 - Aditi Kapoor: I'm glad to hear that you've grasped the importance of competitive spirit from our recent lesson. Your understanding aligns perfectly with the key takeaways.
Indeed, competitive spirit serves as a powerful catalyst for thinking creatively and fostering innovation. When individuals are driven to outperform their competition, they are more likely to explore unconventional solutions and push the boundaries of what is possible. This, in turn, contributes to economic growth and the rapid development of new ideas and technologies.
Your mention of athletes like Michael Jordan is a great example. Their competitive spirit not only propels them to success in their respective fields but also inspires others to strive for greatness. Overcoming challenges and constantly seeking improvement are integral aspects of a competitive mindset.
25/11/23, 22:22 - Aditi Kapoor: Cloudious, we discussed those, are you sure you aren't aware of the projects?
26/11/23, 18:15 - Cloudious EWYL22E0796: I'm sure I am not aware of that Ms
26/11/23, 18:16 - Cloudious EWYL22E0796: I am a proud EDOOFIAN

At our school  our officials used to announce top 10 in every class each and  every term.  Number 1 up to 3 were awarded since everyone need an award there was a great competition leading us to wide reading and researching. As a result of wide reading my pass rate increase leading me to yield better in educational field. Iwas never recognized that my  passes due to competitive spirit but now I am seeing that after Wednesday lesson.

30/11/23, 15:57 - Cloudious EWYL22E0796: OK 
Our Wednesday lesson was mainly focused on the power of analyzing
I understand that Firstly you have to understand the topic or task that you have been given. 
Secondly you have to break the task into parts. Then we look on inputs of the task for example data and information. We'll move on to processing whe we plan on how to use the inputs and finally stage is for output evaluation. This is when we are evaluating the outcome.
I understand about learning from our mistakes. This helps us to avoid the same mistakes several times so buy evaluate our results we learn more. Lastly we look at applications of these in the real life helps us to have good decisions as well as in problem solving
