How are you this afternoon

21/07/22, 01:11 - Unknown: I am doing good Blessings, so have you read your Report on the EWYL group?
21/07/22, 01:12 - Blessing EWYL22E0098: Yes I did sir

21/07/22, 01:19 - Unknown: Sure Blessings, I am not disappointed as I know for a fact that you are trying, Just let us try to avoid and Solve our Daily challenges, Isn't that what a Proud Edoofian supposed to do?
21/07/22, 01:19 - Unknown: You are my Proud Edoofian and I still Believe in you.
21/07/22, 01:20 - Blessing EWYL22E0098: Of course a proud Edoofian must have a mind of not giving up...thank you for believing in me sir
21/07/22, 01:21 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
