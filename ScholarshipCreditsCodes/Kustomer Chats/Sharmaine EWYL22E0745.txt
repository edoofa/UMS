20/03/23, 07:54 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

21/03/23, 01:04 - Sharmaine EWYL22E0745: From the Wednesday lesson l learnt that learning from others' experiences helps broaden perspective, learn from mistakes, network, gain inspiration, and develop skills for personal growth and achieving goals. And also NetFlorist's success story is a testament to the power of innovation, customer-centricity, and hard work which means that if l want to succeed in life l should be innovative so that my vision and dedication to my business will enable me to build a good company such as South Africa's largest online gifting company, NetFlorist .

27/03/23, 08:09 - Sharmaine EWYL22E0745: So from the Wednesday wisdom l learnt that Ethical wealth creation involves creating value for others in a way that is both sustainable and fair. This means that the wealth created is not gained at the expense of others, but rather through the provision of goods and services that people want and need. It also means that the wealth created is not hoarded or used solely for personal gain, but is instead reinvested in the creation of more value for others.Also ethical wealth creation often involves creating win-win scenarios where everyone involved benefits.Ultimately, the key to ethical wealth creation is to understand that wealth is not an end in itself, but a means to an end. Wealth can be used to create value for others, to improve people's lives, and to make the world a better place. If we despise wealth, we will never be able to create it ethically. But if we embrace it as a tool for good, we can use it to achieve great things.

How are you?

As informed earlier, I was not available last week from Thursday to Friday and the organization was closed on Saturday and Sunday. So let's focus today's session solely on these three things:

1) Wednesday lesson + Weekend activity understanding
2) Whether you were able to complete last week's Projects targets?
3) What are the challenges you are facing in the projects?

Also, this week will be visiting our _Proud Indian Edoofians_ from Wednesday to Saturday. So, the sessions will be held at that time. And I will be very happy to share the updates of our visit with you as the days go by?
27/03/23, 21:44 - Saloni Rastogi: You have summed up your understanding really well, it reflects a lot of maturity and aspiration to excel in life.
I have read in-depth all your responses and I am glad to say that you have got the crucks of the lesson and activities super well.✨
27/03/23, 21:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Can we work on the community building project then?
27/03/23, 22:32 - Sharmaine EWYL22E0745: I will be looking forward to that..
27/03/23, 22:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Okay, we can discuss on it.
27/03/23, 22:48 - Saloni Rastogi: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/03/23, 22:49 - Saloni Rastogi: A] Through WhatsApp community groups:


STEP 1: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME\/MENTOR NAME\/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED
For eg: In your case it will be-
Sharmaine\/Saloni\/27MAR2023
27/03/23, 22:49 - Saloni Rastogi: STEP 2: We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
27/03/23, 22:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
27/03/23, 22:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
27/03/23, 22:51 - Sharmaine EWYL22E0745: Okay ma’am noted
27/03/23, 23:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Once form the group, add me and let me know.

30/03/23, 17:20 - Saloni Rastogi: Dear Students,
I hope this message finds you well. As your EWYL progresses, it is important that you stay up to date with your assignments and coursework. In order to ensure that you are able to move forward with the new lessons, I want to remind you that you must complete all of your previous assignments by the end of this week.

It is essential that you take the time to thoroughly review and complete your previous assignments. Doing so will not only help you to understand the lesson better, but it will also prepare you for the upcoming lessons. Failure to complete the previous assignments may result in a delay of the new lessons, and ultimately, it may impact your EWYL progress.

Therefore, I urge you to make the completion of your previous assignments a priority. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to seeing your completed assignments and to sharing the new lessons with you soon.

Best regards,
Team EWYL","transform":"
