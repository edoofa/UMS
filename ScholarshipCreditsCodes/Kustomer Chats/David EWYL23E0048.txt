Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self‚Äîthe person you aspire to be‚Äîand consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!

Thank you ma'am.
05/07/23, 13:11 - David EWYL23E0048: My aspiration story.

My name is David Mupatiseni ,I am a boy, am 20 years old now and I leave in Kotwa Growth point.I learnt at Nyamakuyo primary school from grade one to four and from grade 4 to 7 I was at Kotwa government primary school.I did my o level at Kotwa high school and I failed, I go to another school to repeat my o level and then I passed ,I came back again at Kotwa high school for my advanced level .

When I was grade four I faced an abuse from my teacher who use to teach me these days to an extent that I became a person who lost memory in terms of education.I started to have fear towards teachers, I started to hate each and teacher. ,I¬† started to¬† refuse to go to school because of the tough situation I was facing from my teacher and she was a lady.

She use to bit me up ,I still remember that she reached to an extent that she even¬† told the whole class ,students of my age to bit me while am not even defending myself.I went through that problem for almost a year because I was a person who was quite, I was afraid of telling my parents what I was going through because I thought that it will worsen the attitude of my teacher towards me because she use to say your father told me to be strict with you .

One day ,a consultation day was held where all parents were needed at that school and I didn't even told my parents to come because I was afraid that when my parents sees my performance on my school works I will be in trouble.Surprisingly my mother just showed up because her friend told her about the program and I was afraid but she was the one who discovered that I was going through a tough situation.My mother made me to transfer to another school because everyone at Nyamakuyo primary school had a bad attitude for me because of that teacher's attitude, almost every student had the right to insult me , even my health got disturbed and I became slim.

The time I got transferred I was now at grade five level and it seem like I began to start afresh again in terms of education like a young kid because my memory was lost.I reached at secondary level while my performance was low and I started to recover at Form two level and my performance began to I improve .At forms four level my parents actually traveled away from home in search of money and I was left alone at home ,I¬† started to experience hunger ,no food no a proper uniform to wear whilst am going to school. This made me to find strenuous jobs for me to survive buy some needs¬† .When my parents left I didn't have any phone to call them and asked them money for food , this leads me to a greatest suffering.I wrote my o level exams and I failed .

I repeat my o level at a school called chifamba high school and by that time my parents had returned home ,I passed my o level exams at chifamba high school.I returned at kotwa high school for my advanced level ,that's when I started to know about Edoofa through my friend who we were at the same class with at o level, his name is¬† called Tinotenda Kwerengwe.Through edoofa scholarship I actually got a self motivation through the comments I was given with my counselor miss Harmehak and Ma'am Jasmine.

Now am confident enough that all my dreams that I have shall come to pass through Edoofa scholarship ,after a long struggle facing so many difficulties in life which made me to cry all the time.Now the way I perform in terms of education is now different am seing a greatest change because of Edoofa.
05/07/23, 13:11 - David EWYL23E0048: My inspiration story.
