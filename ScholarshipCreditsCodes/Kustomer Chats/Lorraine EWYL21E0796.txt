23/07/22, 20:38 - Jasmine Kaur: Sat Activity:Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
This week, we discovered that people who are successful don't hold the world responsible for their failures. They accept accountability for their own choices and results. To develop this mindset of taking responsibility for everything and avoiding the blame game takes time and focus. As your Saturday Assignment your are required to write a short write up, on the growth mindset of successful people and how will you make sure you develop the same mindset. The word limit for this assignment is 150-200 words. Kindly make sure you follow the word limit strictly, any responses less than the minimum word limit will not be marked.
You are required to submit the same by Monday 10 AM  on the dedicated EWYL line.

Happy learning !

Having a plan as a learner is very important as it helps you maximize and prioritize on the things that are of urgency or importance. Most students do not have an organized study plan and if they do, they fail to follow the plan drawn. As the Wednesday Wisdom offered advice on how to use our time wisely. You must share your daily schedules with ,e as part of your Saturday activity in a tabular format that you can check on the internet.You can draw it on paper and show it to me..
