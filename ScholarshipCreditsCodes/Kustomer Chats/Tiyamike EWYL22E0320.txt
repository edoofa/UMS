14/07/22, 17:51 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Here is the answer the student wrote and shared back with me.

`By enabling children to program their own stories, games and animations, Scratch is intended to help young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively, and learn essential skills for life in the 21st century  while improving academic performance.`
` Scratch for kids is a learning experience that is fun and exciting. Therefore, this helps them get over their fear of science and technology. `
` A program like scratch can give students a place where they can have fun as they learn in the process,creating projects that express their ideas.`
`With scratch students learn,  programming,Demonstrate learning,Understand math applications and  Boost critical thinking.`
`The ability to code computer programs is an important part of literacy in today's society. When people learn to code in Scratch, they learn important fundamental concepts of programming. `
`In addition of learning coding, computer programming also plays an important role in gaining the students' skills such as problem solving, cooperative learning.`

`Many choose online courses to learn programming nowadays such as courses offered by skooqs for kids ages between, 5 to 18, with scratch courses that fun enjoyable and teach student the basics and core fundamentals of programming, teaching them to  build scratch games such as, a  balloon popping game,creating a save the shark game, to name a few.`\"
