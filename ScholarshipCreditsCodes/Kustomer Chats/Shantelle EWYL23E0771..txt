15/11/23, 17:56 - Aditi Kapoor: Happy Wednesday! 🌟
Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

18/11/23, 14:47 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one – it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,

19/11/23, 11:43 - Shantelle EWYL23E0771.: OK, when I was still doing my O'level I had four friends. We used to do everything together, playing, studying, eating and many things best friends could do. We also would keep each other's secrets. Then one day in our class we were having an inclass test and the marks were to be seen by our Headmaster. My friends would not attend to classes regularly so they knew nothing when it comes to the test. I would ask them to come to lessons but they would say we are aware af what's being taught. My sister advised me that I shouldn't play with them but I just thought that she was being jealous coz we were quite close. 

Our teacher told us that the bench mark was 70% and my friends became scared. Then they decided to be absent for the test, they tried to convince me to go with them as well, and I was almost giving in to their temptations but that was when I realized that if I go with them I was going to ruin my future and also my sister would be very worried if she comes to know about this, and then I refused them and they went alone. Then when the marks were out and their papers were missing, they were taken to the Head's office and they were suspended. 

That was when I realized that, one must choose friends wisely, and what ever the situation may be one must be able to stand on their grounds and make decisions wisely without being forced or under anyone's influence.
19/11/23, 12:26 - Shantelle EWYL23E0771.: Am I supposed to share it in my EWYL group or here

23/11/23, 14:19 - Shantelle EWYL23E0771.: Ok, on The Power Of Competitive Spirit, I understood that competition amongst individuals or nations compels one to be pushed into working harder than before and people might end up getting successful and reaching their goals because they wouldn't want to be at the bottom but at the front and to be known as the best
23/11/23, 14:21 - Aditi Kapoor: Absolutely! Your insight into the power of competitive spirit perfectly captures a fundamental aspect of its influence. Competition serves as a compelling force that propels individuals or even nations to exert extra effort and work harder than before. The desire to avoid being at the bottom and instead strive for the top spot motivates individuals to push their limits.
23/11/23, 14:21 - Aditi Kapoor: So we are concluding our session, I want to say it's been an amazing conversation.

Have an incredible and productive day ahead!
27/11/23, 09:41 - Shantelle EWYL23E0771.: Ok the Spirit of competition is the desire to succed, pushing harder than the others, consistently performing at an elevated level, being the best and winning. A case in point was when there were competition of Gospel music festivals, and as I enjoy singing gospel music, I signed up. At the first competition I did better because the competition was very stiff. I wasn't expecting contestants to sing so well. After the competition I decided that I had to go extra mile on my practicing. 

I would always spent most of the time practicing with my tutor and when we didn't have any lesson I would practice on my own. I couldn't sleep a wink because my main aim was to get that trophy and win in the competition. When the day of the finale competition arrived, I was pretty nervous but I had to stay strong or else I would ruine everything. My chance came and it wasn't, very difficult as I was expecting. Many audiences liked my song and were applauding me. The competition cake to an end and I went home with the trophy. That's when I realized that if you want to win , you need to push harder than the others and do the best.
