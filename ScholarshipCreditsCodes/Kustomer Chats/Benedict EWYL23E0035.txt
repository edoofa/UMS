10/05/23, 15:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Dear Proud Edoofian,

I am excited to announce that today’s Wednesday Wisdom will be talking about the spirit of belonging and the feeling of being part of the Edoofa student community. As a member of the Edoofa family, it is important to understand the significance of being part of a community that fosters personal and academic growth. We will explore the benefits of being part of the Edoofa student community, including the sense of belonging and unity that it creates, the opportunities for networking and mentorship, and the development of essential skills such as leadership, teamwork, and communication.
The Lesson also delve into the idea of belonging as an ability, and how we can develop this ability to connect with others, build relationships, and establish a sense of belonging that allows us to feel valued, appreciated, and accepted.

Let's come together to learn, grow, and build a stronger sense of community.
Best regards,
Team EWYL

18/05/23, 16:03 - Saloni Rastogi: And the Wednesday Lesson, Benedict?
18/05/23, 16:09 - Benedict EWYL23E0035: From the Wednesday lesson I learnt that servant leadership is when the leader chooses to serve and put other people's needs before his own and helps them develop and perform better. This Wednesday lesson made me notice how this type of leadership is at play right here at Edoofa
18/05/23, 16:11 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, You are right! 
Servant leadership is a philosophy that emphasizes the act of serving others as the primary focus of leadership. Instead of prioritizing personal power or authority, a servant leader puts the needs of their team members and the community first.
18/05/23, 16:12 - Benedict EWYL23E0035: Yes. That is true
18/05/23, 16:14 - Saloni Rastogi: That’s Great!

This weekend, sit with yourself and write about how you can use the EWYL programme to master the skill of leadership, and make a plan for which projects you will prioritise to be a leader in the student community. How will you ensure that your name is on the next list of student leaders for the Edoofa student community? Some of the students have already been recommended as Student Leaders by the mentors; how will you ensure that your name is on the next list of student leaders for the Edoofa student community?

21/05/23, 22:05 - Benedict EWYL23E0035: The EWYL programme is not only a means of earning scholarship credits, but also an on-field learning experience to develop my leadership skills. To develop my leadership skills, I will prioritise on the Community building project. I choose this project not because it is easy, but because communicating with peers and enlightening them about new opportunities helps build self confidence which is a key factor in developing leadership skills. Also, having a junior creates a sense of responsibility, thus giving me a platform to sharpen my leadership skills. The African Schools Reform mission will also help as I will be meeting with decision makers, people who are already leaders in their respective places. By talking to them, I will learn from them how a leader comducts themselves and how they make conclusive decisions.
22/05/23, 14:52 - Benedict EWYL23E0035: I  am a proud Edoofian
22/05/23, 14:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Alex who loved playing the piano. Despite facing financial hardships, he practiced on an old, worn-out piano every day. His passion and dedication led him to enter a prestigious music competition.
