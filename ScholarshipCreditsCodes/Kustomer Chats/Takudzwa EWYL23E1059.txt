22/01/24, 16:55 - Aditi Kapoor: Takudzwa, When the schoolâ€™s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
22/01/24, 17:00 - Takudzwa EWYL23E1059: Ok .most of the schools in my community their fees are $60 per term
22/01/24, 17:01 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, then in this case try to reach out to other schools, okay?
22/01/24, 17:04 - Aditi Kapoor: So we are wrapping up for today and look forward to connecting in our next session with more enthusiasm.ðŸŒº

Artificial Intelligence has raised concerns about job displacement, it also brings forth a host of new employment opportunities. There are some emerging job domains spurred by Artificial Intelligence which include Data annotation specialist, AI ethics specialist, AI psychologists, AI Trainers, AI Roboticists and Al Auditors and Regulators. Al also paves the way for a new era of employment opportunities characterised by innovation ,creativity and interdisciplinary collaboration.

It's fantastic to hear about your insights from yesterday's lesson on Artificial Intelligence (AI). Understanding that AI involves machines simulating human intelligence processes, including learning, reasoning, and self-correction, is key to grasping its potential impact.
While AI does raise concerns about job displacement, it's important to note the plethora of new employment avenues it brings forth. These include emerging job domains like Data Annotation Specialists, AI Ethics Specialists, AI Psychologists, AI Trainers, AI Roboticists, and AI Auditors and Regulators. It's remarkable to see how AI is paving the way for a new era of employment characterized by innovation, creativity, and interdisciplinary collaboration.
