05/12/23, 15:46 - Unknown: I am doing good. Thank you so much for asking.
05/12/23, 15:52 - Unknown: Now, regarding the Saturday activity , I'm eager to read your response.
05/12/23, 15:58 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0539: Ms Sharda, I started on Friday and we did not do the *Wednesday Wisdom* which is followed by a weekend activity which you share on Saturday. This means I did not do the Saturday activity.
05/12/23, 16:02 - Unknown: Alright Tanyaradzwa. I am aware of the same. But I did share this week's Saturday Activity with you on the EWYL group to familiarize you with all this.
05/12/23, 16:02 - Unknown: Let's also explore the progress of the projects you've been actively engaged in. Let's start with the Community Building Project.
In this initiative, you're reaching out to build a community and share Edoofa opportunities.

How many students have you interacted with so far?

And what are the exact difficulties or challenges that you are facing while working on the project?
05/12/23, 16:11 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0539: There has been a great progress since I took into action the advice you gave me on what to share with the students. They have a greater understanding about the Edoofa scholarship program and on the quality of education offered in India.
However, some take long to fill the application forms and I intend not to put pressure on them as it might make them lose interest.
05/12/23, 16:31 - Unknown: Effective Communication:Your success in conveying the key aspects of the Edoofa scholarship program reflects effective communication.

Understanding Student Pace:It's wise not to put pressure on students to fill out application forms quickly.
Patience is crucial, as it allows them to process the information at their own pace and maintain genuine interest.

Maintaining Interest:Consider periodic gentle reminders or follow-ups to keep the information fresh in their minds.
Share additional success stories or unique aspects of the program to sustain their interest.

Keep up the excellent work, and if you encounter any challenges or have further questions, feel free to reach out.

05/12/23, 16:44 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0539: I mostly get contact details of the administration and they are hard to convince in getting the headmaster's contact. I only interacted with my school principal and as of now he has many school projects at hand bt he ensured he would get back to me once he is free.
05/12/23, 17:07 - Unknown: Thank you for sharing your progress. It's commendable that you're  actively seeking contact details of school administrators and have  engaged with your school principal.
05/12/23, 17:08 - Unknown: Obtaining contact details of school administrators is a positive step in expanding your network.
05/12/23, 17:08 - Unknown: t's reassuring that your school principal has acknowledged your request and committed to getting back to you.

09/12/23, 18:41 - Unknown: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into ‚Äì the virtues of honesty and hard work.

We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work ‚Äì a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.üåü

Now, I would like to know the progress on your community Building project. Do you have any student application forms that you can share with me today?
16/01/24, 15:53 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0539: It has been going well but I don't have application forms as of now. I have created a group for community building and the students have so many questions that they raised. As of now some haven't decided on what they would like to do but I informed them that Edoofa offers counseling sessions which helps to choose the right program.
16/01/24, 16:19 - Unknown: It's wonderful to hear that you've created a group for community  building. Addressing the questions and uncertainties raised by students  is crucial for building trust and encouraging participation. Here's a  guide to help you navigate this situation:
16/01/24, 16:20 - Unknown: Counseling Sessions:Emphasize the value of Edoofa's counseling sessions. Highlight that these sessions are designed to assist students in making informed decisions about their academic and career paths. Encourage those who haven't decided on a program to take advantage of this valuable resource.

Addressing Questions:Take a proactive approach in addressing the questions raised by students. If certain questions are recurring, consider organizing a Q&A session or providing written materials that comprehensively address common concerns.
16/01/24, 16:20 - Unknown: Highlight Success Stories:Share success stories of students who have gone through the Edoofa program. This can provide inspiration and demonstrate the positive outcomes that can result from active participation.

Encourage Decision-Making:While some students may be undecided, remind them that it's okay not to have a clear direction at this stage. Encourage them to explore their interests and utilize the counseling sessions to help make informed decisions.
16/01/24, 16:21 - Unknown: Is that clear Tanyaradzwa? 
What are the challenges that you are facing while interacting with these students?
16/01/24, 16:23 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0539: Thank you I'll definitely do this
16/01/24, 16:24 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0539: Yes it's clear
They also ask if you are allowed to change program at the University if you are having challenges or if you are not comfortable with the program at hand
16/01/24, 16:27 - Unknown: Yes, Tanyaradzwa. There is definitely a flexibility of changing the programs in the universities. The only requirement for this is to ensure that the student should be fulfilling the basic requirement required for a particular course.
16/01/24, 16:30 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0539: Okay that's great because from what I heard most of the students would not have thoroughly researched about the program before applying.
16/01/24, 17:59 - Unknown: Yes, Tanyaradzewa. 
Our session is wrapped up for today. I wish you a wonderful day ahead. Maintain your enthusiasm and eagerness to learn as we progress on this transformative path.
Have a lovely day!
16/01/24, 17:59 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0539: Have a great day tooüòä
