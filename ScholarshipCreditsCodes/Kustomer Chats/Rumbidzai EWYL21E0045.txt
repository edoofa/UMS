12/07/22, 19:46 - Unknown: Hello Rumbidzai !
12/07/22, 19:46 - Unknown: Good to know that.
12/07/22, 19:47 - Unknown: However, I also asked about your progress on the task and activity. Did you work on them?
12/07/22, 19:47 - Unknown: I was expecting a response Rumbidzai.
12/07/22, 20:56 - Rumbidzai EWYL21E0045: Not yet I'm sorry let me by the end of the day
12/07/22, 22:42 - Unknown: I see Rumbidzai. I am giving you an extension.
12/07/22, 22:42 - Unknown: But do not, I am here to teach you to work under pressure, and with deadlines as well. This will be very important in you work life. Do you agree?
12/07/22, 22:54 - Rumbidzai EWYL21E0045: Yes I agree
12/07/22, 23:28 - Unknown: Great Rumbidzai, so make sure that you do complete it today and make a habit to complete the tasks on a schedule. RIght?
12/07/22, 23:30 - Rumbidzai EWYL21E0045: Yes sir now I'm working on inclass activities
13/07/22, 00:27 - Unknown: Yes I understand Rumbidzai, learning to manage your time will certainly be very helpful for you, RIght?
13/07/22, 03:38 - Rumbidzai EWYL21E0045: Yes indeed
13/07/22, 17:55 - Unknown: Hello my proud edoofian! How are you? Please send the proud edoofian message for the day.
13/07/22, 17:55 - Unknown: Good to note that you understand the importance of time management, now you have to learn to respect and abide by the deadline, Do you know how it will help you?
13/07/22, 21:02 - Rumbidzai EWYL21E0045: Proud Edoofian
13/07/22, 21:04 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
14/07/22, 03:01 - Rumbidzai EWYL21E0045: That's great
14/07/22, 22:04 - Unknown: \"Success is Not Final, Failure is Not Fatal: it is the Courage to Continue that Counts\"- Winston Churchill 

Greeting of the day my proud edoofian! How are you doing?
14/07/22, 22:04 - Unknown: Did you work on the Wednesday wisdom task I shared with you yesterday Rumbidzai?

Personally I found it very interesting as it discussed the life and struggles of Patrice, an African Billionaire and I believe my students should take inspiration from him.
15/07/22, 02:03 - Rumbidzai EWYL21E0045: What exactly should I do in the activities I don't understand
15/07/22, 03:05 - Unknown: You just have to share with me what you have understood from the lesson Rumbidzai.
15/07/22, 05:12 - Rumbidzai EWYL21E0045: Okay but sometimes I respond to the tasks you share with me but you don't say anything about it.
15/07/22, 19:59 - Unknown: Yes Rumbidzai. This is why We have the proud edoofian chant. You have to send a message here on a daily basis.
15/07/22, 19:59 - Unknown: If you do not then I won't be able to respond to your message. This is because of the technology being used.
15/07/22, 20:00 - Unknown: However, don't be afraid, Mrs. Davi and I go through each response you share and even record it with us.
15/07/22, 20:00 - Rumbidzai EWYL21E0045: Okay I see
15/07/22, 21:16 - Unknown: So now Rumbidzai, please share the response to the wednesday wisdom, what fid you learn from it?

16/07/22, 00:00 - Unknown: Do you must submit it today itself Rumbidzai.
25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

29/07/22, 21:19 - Rumbidzai EWYL21E0045: Proud Edoofian

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:34 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well.

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off
