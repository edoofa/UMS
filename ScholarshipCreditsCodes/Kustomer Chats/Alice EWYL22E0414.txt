23/07/22, 16:41 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times pere week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these att
23/07/22, 20:40 - Jasmine Kaur: We will be completing our discussion on Monday edoofian,
Do not forget to send *I am a proud edoofian* everyday on this line.
23/07/22, 20:41 - Alice EWYL22E0414: OK thank you
25/07/22, 03:18 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
25/07/22, 18:07 - Jasmine Kaur: Hope you had a great weekend,

25/07/22, 23:52 - Jasmine Kaur: Before we move forward to this session.
25/07/22, 23:52 - Jasmine Kaur: First of all, the newsletter for today is very interesting and impressive.
There are 2 questions in it, you must answer them now.
 I am waiting for your answer and then I will share my understanding \/ opinion about them.

26/07/22, 00:11 - Alice EWYL22E0414: l am still going through
26/07/22, 00:26 - Alice EWYL22E0414: 1. through the spirit of love and togetherness and having self- esteem.being a person who has style and manner of dress and having strength of mind.
26/07/22, 00:32 - Alice EWYL22E0414: 2. through working hard together ,accepting one's ideas and contributions .Students should be compassionate in their actions and their parents should be supportive to them.
26/07/22, 19:52 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings my proud edoofian,
I hope your day is going well!
26/07/22, 21:26 - Alice EWYL22E0414: yes thank you
26/07/22, 21:27 - Alice EWYL22E0414: good day to you
26/07/22, 22:14 - Jasmine Kaur: To add to your discussion, Actions that are based on the principles of Oneness are rewarding in the sense that they fill us with happiness and joy, whether or not you get your desired results. Just the act of committing to the effort makes us feel connected to everything and can help heal isolation, loneliness, and helplessness.
26/07/22, 22:58 - Alice EWYL22E0414: OK noted with thanks
26/07/22, 23:08 - Alice EWYL22E0414: how are you today
26/07/22, 23:09 - Jasmine Kaur: Hence in edoofa you can show your commitment and efforts by working on the projects we have, also *as a mentor I understand that projects have a dependency on others for example if some school head is responding or not, whether a company is interested or not etc but for activities and lessons you should keep the focus on top to shine in the community*
26/07/22, 23:18 - Alice EWYL22E0414: well explained ,thank you Ms Riva
26/07/22, 23:33 - Jasmine Kaur: Being your mentor as we grow in this relationship I am trying to understand your obstacles\/issues and on the same lines I expect that you also make consistent efforts by ensuring *A1 attendance* in sessions so that you prove to be one of my best students!
26/07/22, 23:56 - Alice EWYL22E0414: and l am also trying my best to be attendive

27/07/22, 19:48 - Alice EWYL22E0414: wow and l will be waiting for that...
27/07/22, 23:14 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my proud Edoofian, we are back with our Wednesday lesson.

I realised as soon as I started reading this lesson that most of my students needed to learn and grasp this. One person succeeding and one failing depends solely on how effectively they manage their time. Try to comprehend and apply the measures discussed in the lesson to your everyday life. I'll be here to help you, so that you can focus on learning how to manage your time effectively. In our following session, please explain in detail what you learned from the lesson.Also, do not forget to send *I am a proud edoofian* tomorrow.

Happy learning
27/07/22, 23:24 - Alice EWYL22E0414: thank you
27/07/22, 23:32 - Alice EWYL22E0414: thank you Ms Riva
28/07/22, 17:25 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings my proud edoofian,
I hope you are rising and shining!
28/07/22, 17:31 - Alice EWYL22E0414: greetings to you too
28/07/22, 19:04 - Jasmine Kaur: Can you share your detailed understanding of your Wednesday lesson?
After that I will share my opinion.
28/07/22, 20:00 - Alice EWYL22E0414: OK l will
28/07/22, 20:38 - Alice EWYL22E0414: l understood that Time management is the key to success and is the ability to use your time productively and efficiently or it is the art of having time to do everything without being about it .People who are able to use their time wisely are also good at prioritising and they can do this due to understanding the difference between urgent and important of how something he or she wants to do is.This can be done due to the use of The Priority Matrix which is the best in reviewing your daily tasks.
28/07/22, 22:54 - Jasmine Kaur: Many successful people have different approaches that got them to where they are today. But the one thing they have in common is that they know how to juggle high-level projects and make sure they spend the bulk of their time on the tasks that are most conducive to their success.
28/07/22, 23:12 - Alice EWYL22E0414: well explained thank you
28/07/22, 23:15 - Jasmine Kaur: In my opinion time management is on you,
Time management is about being about to designate time to complete everything that you need to do, and assigning the 24 hours you have every day to the right task. If you can effectively pair up your time and the things on your to-do list, you will be able to operate at the foundational level of success. How you spend your day is up to you, whether you’re working on a project or you’re watching television all day, you’re responsible for designating your time wisely.
28/07/22, 23:17 - Alice EWYL22E0414: yes thank you thats the truth
28/07/22, 23:58 - Jasmine Kaur: Also since we talk of time management, you have to submit 1 company form\/1 school form by tomorrow.Research about it through google\/linked in and approach them to get the form filled.
29/07/22, 00:01 - Alice EWYL22E0414: OK l will do so
29/07/22, 17:41 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings my proud edoofian,
I hope you are having a productive day.
29/07/22, 20:28 - Alice EWYL22E0414: greetings how are you?

29/07/22, 20:55 - Alice EWYL22E0414: still working on them ,its only that my network today is not stable
29/07/22, 20:57 - Alice EWYL22E0414: is it the form that you send to me which is supposed to be filled ?
30/07/22, 00:26 - Jasmine Kaur: Do you have the company forms and school forms with you, the ones I sent to you while your onboarding?
30/07/22, 01:03 - Alice EWYL22E0414: you only send me Application forms
30/07/22, 01:04 - Alice EWYL22E0414: maybe you can send me company forms and school forms
30/07/22, 01:07 - Alice EWYL22E0414: so that l can fill and send them to you tomorrow if it's possible
01/08/22, 18:30 - Alice EWYL22E0414: Greetings to you Ms Riva
01/08/22, 21:52 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously.

01/08/22, 22:29 - Alice EWYL22E0414: how was your weekend❓
01/08/22, 22:30 - Jasmine Kaur: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Team edoofa has arranged a webinar  for you all, 
The webinar would be taken by Ronard Kachage.
Designation : Co founder at Success Magazine.

Date 05 August 
Time 3:30 PM [ Zimbabwe time ] 

Takeaways from the webinar.
The topic will be along the lines of how Mr. Kachaje went on to pursue a career in real estate by having a degree in the same field and eventually figured out his calling which was building the media brand  Magazine. One of the many benefits of starting a business or pursuing your passions when one is a bit older is that they bring all of the experience and wisdom to the table. 
The journey of Mr. Kachaje is certainly inspiring, growth-oriented, and a wonderful example for the youth of today, not only in terms of being passionate about what you believe in but also having a consistent outlook towards learning on the way and figuring things out at the same time. 

Please fill the RSVP form
