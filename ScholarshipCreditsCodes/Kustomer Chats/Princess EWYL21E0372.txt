15/07/22, 18:20 - Princess EWYL21E0372: Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe is a well known business man here in Africa. He got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business. He acquired this knowledge while helping his father sell liquor to mine workers. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe studied and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Swaziland, then subsequently earned a law degree from the University of the Witwatersrand. After getting his LLB, in 1988, Patrice Motsepe got a great job offer from the Bowman Gilfillan law firm, which was one of South Africa’s most reputable law firms. His drive, commitment to growth, and high success rates in his job activities got his bosses to take a unique interest in him. He later met several mining organizations and studying their operations sprouted a zeal and attraction in him for the business. This exposure caused Patrice Motsepe to start studying the mining business in every way that he could. Patrice Motsepe promptly founded the African Rainbow Minerals (ARM) and proceeded to acquire one of the mine shafts that were up for sale by AngloGold. Today, his company has strategic partnerships and mergers with other mining organizations and has added a wide list of minerals to its coffers like nickel, chrome, coal, iron, manganese and precious metals (platinum and its related products). In the process, Patrice Motsepe has built one of the largest mining companies in the world. Patrice Motsepe is a good example of determination and success.

Proud Edoofians, These are the footsteps that we have to follow. The traits that he gained and possessed are not something that could be taught in schools\/ universities. That is why our head coach, Ms. Davi, tries that through every lesson you are able to get one step closer towards gaining these traits and making your career sucessful.

18/07/22, 16:51 - Princess EWYL21E0372: The Fastest Selling business in Zimbabwe
Agriculture
Zimbabwe’s commercial farming sector is traditionally a source of exports and foreign exchange. Additionally, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) assists Zimbabwe’s farmers to adopt conservation agriculture techniques.Furthermore, the institute helps in increasing yield through a sustainable method of farming. Hence, it is very possible to start a business in the agriculture and farming sector in Zimbabwe.

Zimbabwe is an agricultural country with agriculture being the main foreign exports of Zimbabwe. Acquiring knowledge of the farming sector is important if a person is about to start a business, like how to grow food products and get to know about latest farming practices. At the same time, a potential farmer will also need a proper financing plan on how he or she will acquire agriculture land, and how to finance the business.

Here are some small agriculture business ideas :

Fertilizer distribution business
Dried flower business
Poultry farming
Sunflower farming
Mushroom farming
Fish farming
Vegetables and fruits export
Livestock feed production
Tea growing
Dairy farming
Medicinal herbs farming
Corn farming.

The lucrative farming opportunities are:

1. Poultry Farming:
Poultry farming is the process of raising domesticated birds such as chickens, ducks, turkeys, and geese for the purpose of farming meat or eggs for food. Poultry Farming in Zimbabwe is probably one of the most lucrative farming business you can do. The quick maturity of chicken presents one of the finest opportunity for entrepreneurs to make good money within the shortest period of time possible.The market is always there waiting to be tapped. The demand for poultry products such as eggs is so high that people go about every day looking for where to get the supplies needed.
2. Rice Farming:
Considering the fact that Zimbabwe has a huge market for rice, if one

Happy Learning!

10/10/22, 21:15 - Princess EWYL21E0372: I am a proud edoofian
10/10/22, 21:16 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

I hope that you are in good health and spirits

Let us start Today’s morning with this motivational quote by Mason Cooley
Procrastination makes easy things hard and hard things harder.

I believe that you would also agree with this, right?
11/10/22, 19:43 - Unknown: Also, Princess, I believe it has been a week now since we started with our African School Education Reform Mission Project.
May I know if you have made any progress in that because I was expecting some forms so that I can schedule the calls.

Please let me know if you are facing any hindrances while doing this.
11/10/22, 20:57 - Princess EWYL21E0372: Yes i do

Let me share one with you right now.
12/10/22, 20:56 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!
12/10/22, 21:32 - Princess EWYL21E0372: Alright thank you

Let us start Today’s morning with this motivational quote:
He who asks a question is a fool for five minutes; he who does not ask a question remains a fool forever.
13/10/22, 21:29 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.
