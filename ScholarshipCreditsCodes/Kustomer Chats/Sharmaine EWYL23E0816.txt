 As we witness the remarkable progress in AI, we ponder its potential to transform our lives and simultaneously question if it will replace us

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
17/11/23, 16:24 - Sharmaine EWYL23E0816: Okey maam
17/11/23, 16:25 - Ananya: Well, to begin with, I would suggest that we proceed with something that aligns with your interest. So, would you like to share which one is your favorite project: the community building or the school reform project?

Interested individuals can join the group and connect with you.
Communicate with them and provide further details about Edoofa.
17/11/23, 17:14 - Sharmaine EWYL23E0816: Okey maam thank you
18/11/23, 16:17 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
19/11/23, 12:58 - Sharmaine EWYL23E0816: Okey, so what happened was that, there is this other day when I was invited to one of my friend's birthday. Everything was going so well but the problem started when my friends started doing improper things ; drinking alcohol and doing bad things with boys. I wanted to leave immediately because what they were doing was not in me but one of my friends stopped me and started to force me but I didn't give in to them rather I started to tell them the harm in what they were doing.Non of them listened to me. 

I left there with a broken heart, not believing that my friends could do that. On my way home I got a message from them saying that our relationship is over because I was too boring for them. I was extremely hurt by that because I loved my friends very much. 

After a while I later realized that they were never good friends and they didn't deserve me at all. I didn't let circumstances dictate my path rather I took charge of everything.

It's commendable that you stood your ground and tried to communicate your concerns about their behavior.
21/11/23, 15:58 - Sharmaine EWYL23E0816: Yaa I really did try my best even though it was very difficult
21/11/23, 16:02 - Ananya: I understand, Sharmaine! By the way, you know while I was traveling to the office today, something really important struck my mind as a mentor. Due to this, I have a really important question for you.

24/11/23, 15:35 - Ananya: Good morning, Sharmaine!

I hope you're doing well. Let's kick off our session with an exciting activity! I'd love to hear about your favorite animal, and in return, I'll share an amazing fact about it. Are you ready?
24/11/23, 15:41 - Sharmaine EWYL23E0816: Good afternoon, my favorite animal is a puppy.
24/11/23, 15:43 - Ananya: You know, Puppies have 28 baby teeth, which eventually fall out to make way for their 42 adult teeth. It's like they have their own version of a 'puppy tooth fairy' moment as they grow up!
24/11/23, 15:46 - Sharmaine EWYL23E0816: Mm okey I really didn't know about that, thanks
24/11/23, 15:49 - Ananya: So, Sharmaine did you get a chance to understand the dynamics of competition through your wednesday lesson?
24/11/23, 15:51 - Sharmaine EWYL23E0816: Yes I did
24/11/23, 15:52 - Ananya: Great, kindly share what you have understood about it.
24/11/23, 16:07 - Sharmaine EWYL23E0816: I understood that, having a competition makes one to have a mindset to always be the best, it is a push factor for growth and success.  It always makes individuals to improve when they fail and also build the spirit of excellence in one's work.  It also makes one to have that passion to be ahead of everyone no matter what thus making individuals to be hard work.
24/11/23, 16:08 - Ananya: Absolutely! Your understanding is spot on. Competition indeed instills a mindset to consistently strive for the best, acting as a driving force for personal growth and success. It not only motivates individuals to enhance their skills after failures but also fosters a spirit of excellence in their work.
24/11/23, 16:09 - Sharmaine EWYL23E0816: Yes indeed maam
24/11/23, 16:11 - Ananya: Now, you know, 2023 is wrapping up. Don't you think we should kick off the new year with something big? How about committing to earning a specific amount of scholarship credits?
After all, you wouldn't want to head to India empty-handed.

I'm saying this from my own experience ‚Äì having some credits before you arrive in India isn't just a benefit for you; it's a help for your parents too. Not only this, we often pick students for internships and personal training based on their credits and regularity in the EWYL journey.
Believe me, you've got plenty of time right now being in your home country, so don;t you think we should utilise this time with our utmost dedication?
24/11/23, 16:12 - Sharmaine EWYL23E0816: Yes I think so
24/11/23, 16:15 - Ananya: Are you not sure?
24/11/23, 16:19 - Sharmaine EWYL23E0816: I'm very sure, you are right its a very big advantage for me till I'm in my home town
24/11/23, 16:27 - Ananya: Great news, Tawanda! I've finalized a few students for a 30-day challenge, and I want you to be a part of it. I need you to attend the sessions dedicatedly and put in the hard work for your EWYL projects.
Moreover, I'll set specific targets for you, and I want your commitment to work diligently to achieve them. As your mentor, I'll be there to guide and support you every step of the way. Is that alright with you?
24/11/23, 16:30 - Sharmaine EWYL23E0816: Its Sharmaine maam. 
 Yes it is alright with me
24/11/23, 16:35 - Ananya: Amazing! Let's set a new target for you. For the first 10 days out of the 30, I want you to focus on connecting with two schools and getting eight students to submit their offline application forms.
If you encounter any challenges during this time, reach out to me immediately because we need to achieve this target. I expect you to give it your best effort.
24/11/23, 16:55 - Ananya: Now, I wish you a good luck for your task. Let us connect in our next session so that we can discuss about your progress.
25/11/23, 14:26 - Sharmaine EWYL23E0816: 'I am a Proud Edoofian'

25/11/23, 21:02 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,

After that we started to be serious and we worked very hard, practicing tirelessly. When the day finally came,  it was so tough I tell you. But at the end we made it one the first position and all our hard work paid off.
