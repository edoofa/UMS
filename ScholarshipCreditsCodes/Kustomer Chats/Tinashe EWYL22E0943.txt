I am a proud Edoofian.
02/05/23, 16:47 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.

Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell:

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges.
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
 3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
02/05/23, 17:01 - Tinashe EWYL22E0943: That's a good story.
02/05/23, 17:25 - Ananya: Good Afternoon, *Tinashe*üåÖ

As we go through life, we all make decisions - some good, and some bad. But what separates good decisions from bad decisions, and how can we learn from our experiences to make better choices in the future?

For your Saturday assignment, I would like you to write about your understanding of good decisions and bad decisions. What factors do you consider when making a decision, and how do you know when you have made a good or bad choice? In addition, I would like you to share an example from your life where you made a good or bad decision. What was the situation, what decision did you make, and what was the outcome? What did you learn from this experience, and how has it shaped your decision-making process in the future?

Your submission should be around 200 words in total, and I encourage you to reflect deeply on your experiences and thoughts on decision-making. Remember that we can all learn from our mistakes and successes, and by sharing our experiences, we can help each other make better choices in the future.
