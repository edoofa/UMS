30/01/23, 21:15 - Unknown: A very good afternoon, are you ready for your session now?
30/01/23, 21:15 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

01/02/23, 19:39 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

Happy Learning!

Share in the comments if you have known this before and why is it important!!
10/06/23, 16:02 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week’s Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better—together. It’s why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger—as successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!
11/06/23, 23:37 - Anesu EWYL22E0665: As a student and young person I do agree with the idea that we achieve more and feel better-as a collective whole . Individualism is important but so is me working in a group or society where everyone invites benefits from the experience,when working together one gets to learn new skills and broadens their horizons from those interactions. Our friendships show us the places we ought to work on as individuals and help some thrive from those experiences because sometimes people’s skills are showcased during moments of stress and what other place or situation than in a group. As my weekly activity since I have opted for a path towards success with edoofa program,in my respective school I have taken it upon my self to tell my peers in the benefit of the program for instance hiw the program will help one reach their goals and help the community of Africa,how the Edoofa program will help its members or students to secure jobs or Atleast equip them with the knowledge and skills to tackle every diverse situation. I have tried my best to make them realize that Edoofa is the best option and now it is left for them to decide. Myself and some edoofian students from the school I attend have taken it upon ourselves to help each other be it in studies or projects thus building strong relationships,we created a group where one talks about the productive thing they would have done during the week and ask for help when needed. As students we are helping each other build strong individual and group networks .
