15/11/22, 02:43 - Yamikani EWYL22E0586: Hello
15/11/22, 02:43 - Yamikani EWYL22E0586: It's Yamikani
15/11/22, 17:39 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr
16/11/22, 00:26 - Yamikani EWYL22E0586: Hello
16/11/22, 00:55 - Yamikani EWYL22E0586: Wonderfull
16/11/22, 22:27 - Aditi Kapoor: Today I wanted to discuss the recent message I shared with you. The message that we want to be our daily habit, our words of connecting and experiencing a sense of belonging, We all at team Edoofa are very thrilled as we personally are undertaking the same activity. May I know what have you understood from this message, what is the intention behind the same?
17/11/22, 06:49 - Yamikani EWYL22E0586: I should start texting every morning that I'm a proud edoofian as a reminder that I'm a strong ambitiouse student part of a strong global family of young people who strive for greater heights and adults who help us reach those greater heights and make our parents proyd
17/11/22, 06:51 - Yamikani EWYL22E0586: Tommorow I want be able to text though, my phone will be off, it's at 13% right now and there hasn't been  electricity since Saturday, so I have to board a taxi to another surbub to get my phone charged, please do understand
17/11/22, 06:51 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

 I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. –Michael Jordan

13/01/23, 21:14 - Aditi Kapoor: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
This is to inform you that  today  we celebrate a very prestigious festival in my religion: *Lohri*

The end of the winter season is a joyous one in India, with Lohri celebrated on January 13 annually. This is a special celebration, particularly in Northern India, that marks the harvest of the winter rabi crops and the end of the winter solstice. It celebrates the sun and the ushering in of longer days.
Do research about this festival and let me know whatever insight you gain.
13/01/23, 21:21 - Yamikani EWYL22E0586: Okay I will,
17/01/23, 07:06 - Yamikani EWYL22E0586: Ello
17/01/23, 19:28 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my lovely edoofians, hope you are doing well.

I have some amazing news and an opportunity to share with you. But first, do you know, A 2018 report by WaterAid India and Menstrual Hygiene Alliance India (MHAI) states that there are 336 million menstruating women in India, out of which only 121 million use sanitary pads. Assuming that these women use eight sanitary pads for one cycle (conservatively), a simple calculation reveals that almost one billion sanitary pads are used and disposed of every year.  The primary component in all disposable sanitary napkins is plastic. This takes approximately 500-800 years to fully disintegrate after disposal. Assuming one billion DSNs are disposed of every year, handling menstrual waste becomes a mammoth task.

And the solution to this problem is Sustainable menstruation!

Wondering what it is :

* Sustainable menstruation refers to the use of alternative products during one’s menstrual cycle for the benefit of the body and the earth.
* Sustainable menstruation is being mindful of the negative effects disposable sanitary products have on our environment in an effort to reduce the plastic waste ending up in our oceans or landfills.

I would like to invite you to our webinar on Sustainable menstruation tomorrow I.e. 18th January 2023, wherein we will be joined by Dr.Aarushi Kehar Malhotra. She will be helping us understand it better and how can each one of us be the solution to this problem.

Don’t forget to join by 5:45 PM IST, the webinar will start exactly at 6:00 PM [2:30 PM: Zimbabwean time] . Don’t be late for this webinar. Come prepared with the questions that you might have!

I hope you are doing well.

Time for our Wednesday wisdom, let us dive deep into the art of asking good questions. While listening is an important skill, the art of asking questions is equally, if not more, important when it comes to learning more about your work tasks, unlocking hidden opportunities, delivering better results, and mitigating unforeseen risks.
