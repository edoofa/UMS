01/10/23, 18:58 - Anesuishe EWYL22E1011: Greetings Mam.I have been trying to adjust a lot and it has been becoming stressful because my at first my Indian line wasn't connecting well and then when I thought it was working out someone had hacked into my account and it was blocked and besides that I wasn't reporting to my sessions not because I do not value them but because I was facing technical issues and they weren't in my power .Right now just today itself I have managed  to get another WhatsApp with great difficulty and I even got the Indian sim on Friday.The WhatsApp which expired was registered under the Zimbabwean line and at that time I didn't have an Indian sim so I had no other means to connect.Am sorry for the inconvenience caused but it's not by my design .Please add me into my Edoofa groups.
01/10/23, 19:19 - Anesuishe EWYL22E1011: And yesterday I also failed to connect with you because my line wasn't functioning well it had zero network bars.Im sorry if I made a bad version of myself but honestly speaking it has not been easy for me to adjust and get what I needed ASAP.I even attended the webinar through another colleagues phone

17/05/23, 19:46 - Anesuishe EWYL22E1011: In Today's Wednesday  wisdom I've learnt about servant leadership whereby the Leaders goal is to serve others.An Edoofian should be a servant leader ...thus means being a Caring and loving leader  towards his or her employees .A servant leader serves his followers or servants unlike the According to Larry C Spears a servant leadership is made up of foresight, healing, awareness,empathy, listening, persuasion, Stewardship, commitment to the growth of people and building a community. In my own words in brief I have understood that these are the core values of an ideal servant leader as they  are the people's person ,they get to understand the people's needs and wants and when making decision they will know the future and current impacts.These core values are a form of great motivation to followers and hence enlighten the people being served making the future and current world situation a healthy and loving one and so the world will give birth to greatness and success because of good leaders who would have inspired them.

26/05/23, 01:53 - Anesuishe EWYL22E1011: I am a proud Edoofian
26/05/23, 01:53 - Ananya: Hello everyone! Our latest post on the Edoofa Instagram page is something you definitely wouldn't want to miss. Please visit our page to take a look and feel free to share your own opinions in the comments section.

29/05/23, 18:06 - Anesuishe EWYL22E1011: Greetings, I am a proud Edoofian.
29/05/23, 18:06 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
29/05/23, 18:07 - Ananya: How are you today? How was your weekend?
29/05/23, 18:08 - Anesuishe EWYL22E1011: Im quite okay thank you.My weekend was blessed.
29/05/23, 18:10 - Anesuishe EWYL22E1011: 4.All of the above.
29/05/23, 18:10 - Ananya: May I know if you have attended the event or you will be going to Bulawayo?
29/05/23, 18:13 - Anesuishe EWYL22E1011: No I didn't and I was supposed to go to Bulawayo but during our family discussion we encountered a problem.
29/05/23, 18:17 - Ananya: If you don't mind, may I ask what happened?
29/05/23, 18:23 - Anesuishe EWYL22E1011: We discussed this as a family and discovered that it is a good program you have arranged but however,Bulawayo is the city we found adequate but the timing is challenging us as both my parents will not be able to leave me alone till late and I do not have any family member in that state. So it serves as a huge disadvantage to me as a girl child.
29/05/23, 18:39 - Ananya: I understand that it may seem far, but I would like to take this opportunity to emphasize the incredible dedication and commitment of our founders who have traveled over 5000 miles from India specifically to meet you and address your challenges.

Their purpose in organizing this event is to provide you with invaluable support and guidance, to help solve any problems you may be facing, and to establish a meaningful connection with you and your fellow students.

I definitely want you to reconsider attending the session in Bulawayo. It would be a pleasure to have you there, and I am confident that you will find it a worthwhile experience
29/05/23, 18:41 - Anesuishe EWYL22E1011: That is correct Mam.We will see once again what we can do.
29/05/23, 18:43 - Ananya: Anesuishe, I wanted to inform you about an exciting opportunity that awaits students attending the upcoming event. They will have the chance to be pleasantly surprised by additional scholarship grants and numerous other new opportunities.

08/06/23, 18:30 - Ananya: Well, other than this I have a favorite part of the Wednesday lesson for you:

Pivot Strategically: The ability to pivot and adapt to new circumstances is crucial in an ever-changing world. The authors explain how to recognize when it's time to make a career pivot and provide insights into managing transitions effectively. They emphasize the importance of maintaining a growth mindset and being proactive in shaping your own future.
08/06/23, 18:31 - Anesuishe EWYL22E1011: I have learnt to take up effective network intelligence so as to build up strong relationships that will help me in my career journey.In addition I've learnt to grasp a strong foundation of building strong alliances and also be able to adapt to different situations
08/06/23, 18:32 - Anesuishe EWYL22E1011: Yes Mam that is surely correct and helpful
08/06/23, 18:34 - Ananya: I want to highlight the importance of this because as you prepare to leave your home and embark on your new journey in India, you may encounter various challenges. However, it is essential to adapt to these new circumstances in order to foster personal growth. Embracing change and being open to new experiences will not only help you navigate the challenges but also provide opportunities for growth and development. Therefore, it's crucial to be adaptable and embrace the changes that come your way as you embark on this new chapter of your life in India.
08/06/23, 18:35 - Anesuishe EWYL22E1011: Okay Mam that is correct.However, I have a question.

08/06/23, 18:38 - Anesuishe EWYL22E1011: Later can you you give me a brief insight on what to expect when I embark on my journey in your Country.What do I have to expect?
08/06/23, 18:41 - Ananya: I didn't understand your concern dear, kindly elaborate.
08/06/23, 18:45 - Anesuishe EWYL22E1011: I mean from your experience with other female students from this country, can I know new experiences that tend to stressed them and how long it took the majority of them to adapt.in India.
08/06/23, 18:57 - Ananya: I understand your concern, Anesuishe, as I am a woman living away from my family as well. It's natural to prioritize safety and trust when considering living in a new area. However, I want to assure you that as a team, we prioritize the safety and well-being of all individuals. We work diligently to create a secure environment on campus, and all necessary precautions are taken to ensure that everyone feels protected. Additionally, the university area provides easy access to basic amenities, making it a convenient and enjoyable place to live. While it's important to be mindful of your surroundings, I have confidence that you will be able to navigate and adapt to your new environment.
