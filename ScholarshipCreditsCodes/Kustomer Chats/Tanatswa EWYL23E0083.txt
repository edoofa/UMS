Hope you are well.

Let's begin today's amazing session!
08/12/23, 15:47 - Tanatswa EWYL23E0083: Indeed
08/12/23, 16:02 - Aditi Kapoor: We'll be beginning our new journey toward this earning and learning opportunity and I want you to commence with lots of enthusiasm and willingness to work hard to achieve your dreams as you wanted to build a community and I highly think of this as a great aspiration for giving back to the society and I am sure that this EWYL journey will not only help you to earn Scholarship credits but also upskill you and make you stand out from others and I want to make sure that you excel in all aspects of this journey.
08/12/23, 16:04 - Tanatswa EWYL23E0083: Noted
08/12/23, 16:05 - Aditi Kapoor: I'm eager to know what thrilling plans you have in store as you kick off your journey with these projects! What's your exciting plan of action?
08/12/23, 16:16 - Tanatswa EWYL23E0083: Well to he honest and my parents also share the same sentiments we haven't quite seen any fruits  from Edoofa so far
I enrolled early this year with eagerness and after paying the 300 dollars fee and handing in all that was required from us, we have nothing to show for it 
If we are also going to be honest and transparent with each other the EWLY initiative is also something my parents are very doubtful of and aren't as pleased as I have to market Edoofa to other people and tell them what you guys offer and yet I haven't received any of that 
The money also you get from the EWYL is quite insignificant compared to thousands of dollars of university tuition, again I am working for scholarship credits yet I do not have an actual university, it's quite funny 
I also have always felt you wrongly described the ewyl in the initial stages because the way you sold it to us is that we will be doing projects that actually help and advance us but instead I am just advertising edoofa fir you, simply put 
And when I had brought these issues up with Ms Aditi I was answered quite curtly and insensitively
