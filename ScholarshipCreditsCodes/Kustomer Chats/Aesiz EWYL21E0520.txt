20/07/22, 20:23 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

20/07/22, 20:31 - Aesiz EWYL21E0520: Sir how are you?
I am generally fine. So lately l have been available. I was facilitating some applications  for the local Universities here in Zimbabwe. It has now come to that! So l managed to do some late applications for Harare Institute of Technology and University of Zimbabwe. Haven't received any response yet. Back in my admission group, things haulted, l am not being given any information. So my parents just told me to make a plan B. What does it mean? If l am to be responded by any of the Universities here in Zimbabwe before any progressive arrangements from Edoofa, l am afraid l would have to study here in Zimbabwe. That is not what l want!
21/07/22, 00:43 - Unknown: Hello Aesiz, Hope you are doing well. I think this is a serious issue. I will definitely get the same passed on to the Admissions team.
21/07/22, 00:44 - Unknown: May I know if and When you have shared the  above concern with the Admissions team?
21/07/22, 00:50 - Unknown: Aesiz I have just had a word with Admissions team
21/07/22, 00:50 - Unknown: After 5th July they have not received any response from you, Kindly check your admission group and talk to the team immediately.
21/07/22, 02:42 - Aesiz EWYL21E0520: I had not shared the above concern with them
21/07/22, 02:43 - Aesiz EWYL21E0520: There are the ones who are supposed to give me some updates
21/07/22, 02:45 - Aesiz EWYL21E0520: Last time we talked they said that they are having discussions with LPU concerning some financial benefits. I was told to be patient whilst awaiting feedback. Technically it they had the feedback, wasn't l supposed to be informed? They never told me the conclusions from the discussion. There was no response from me needed, rather l am waiting for their feedback
21/07/22, 05:07 - Unknown: I understand Aesiz, But be assured I will try to help you solve this as soon as possible,  As it's already late, let us connect tomorrow and continue our session. Have a Blessed Evening.
22/07/22, 03:55 - Unknown: Hello Aesiz, How are you today?
25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

I hope you are doing well.

We really appreciate the way you have been showing in all your sessions regularly and we are so happy to see you moving ahead consistently. However, your mentor Mr. Sudeep is available due to personal reason which was unavoidable. We are very rueful about this inconvenience caused.
But nothing to worry about!
He will be available from Monday onwards and will actively take your sessions. Till then, we have been sharing with you our insightful Wednesday lessons and weekend activities. We are sure you are working on them. 

We really want that in this time you keep sharing your understanding with us on the Wednesday lesson and yes, don't forget to follow our daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line.","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:07 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
