25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

27/07/22, 23:48 - Unknown: Great please share the response with me.
28/07/22, 17:54 - Unknown: Hello Panashe, Greetings of the day!
How are you doing?
28/07/22, 21:27 - Panashe EWYL21E0827: Saturday  Assignment
Success means  accomplishments  that a person  admire to reach.  However this certain  goals  they require  effective efforts ,b hardworking and self belief that  you the  person that you able to reach  these goals.  Most of the world's successful people  try hard to work hard daily  they sweat for sweets.  They have a common  vision  they don't just  live  but live  with desire for change. These peace  when ever they find an opportunity, an open door they  use every moment and never waist  any of the  available time.  To be successful  it needs brave people  and competent people who can stand  in both good and bad situations .  The world is fully  of competition so if you are not strong  enough to  stand these resistance  you surely fail because the  journey  is tough as days goes. For someone to be successful  you need  to be always willing to see the opportunity  and to have a  strong spirit  that you can do it  even if you can see that  the outcome  is minor.  For instance  there  company that  are growing  right now  as we speak  that  didn't not exist before  but their owners so an opportunity and use it,  there's  Amazon and  Alababa  there are both online  shopping markets  but these companies were not created  at the same  but at different times hence there is a  great competition  but these companies are  successful.  So it does mean that you think  about  a business  because  there is that one who is already in the game but to forget about that  and bring out your own way on how  to handle the process.  So the business people who are successful  believe in themselves  that  they can do it and encourage those who are not yet or us who are afraid  of the game that it doesn't matter  when you began but what are you gonna do when you get a chance  in the game.
28/07/22, 23:46 - Unknown: Amazing to read your activity response, i am proud to see that you are able to understand complex concepts now. How do you plan to implement in your day to day life?

04/08/22, 23:53 - Panashe EWYL21E0827: The Wednesday lesson 
Gilbert Eugene Peters  a entrepreneur from Zimbabwe  who came from afar even when the road was full of obstacles he managed to make it to the finishing point 
He argues people to to focus more on the dreams rather than the external threats of the dream because the way to success is not a sweet song. He (Gilbert)  with a passion in the carrier in design that also contributed to his rise as an entrepreneur at his early age.  With  the  help of  NGO that help with computer  education  in Highfields were he acquired education from that , he also got some from  the his first  job  as a Internet Cafe assistant  he was able to build a  strong foundation in his favor.  At 19 when he was a did dish installation  and it also marked  the birth of the Spidex media .  By hiring  his 2 mates  his friends  were  able to  keep him  floating  as there were able to  install satellite dishes in about  2000 house  this helped to secure his investment. Furthermore ,  with  the education he acquired from the  University of Cape Town in South Africa Bachelor of Creative Arts (BCA) it opened to more exposure  in his way.

04/08/22, 23:53 - Panashe EWYL21E0827: Im doing good Sir
05/08/22, 00:58 - Unknown: Good to read your understanding of the lesson Panashe. The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years. The price is knowing that time is working on your side even when the results don’t show it... yet.
05/08/22, 00:59 - Panashe EWYL21E0827: Absolutely it's a paying struggle
05/08/22, 02:01 - Unknown: You see Panashe, a lack of consistency keeps ordinary people from achieving extraordinary results. Excelling at the small choices that compound over time perpetually leaves you in favorable circumstances. No matter what happens in the world, you’re never in a position where you are forced into a bad decision.
05/08/22, 02:09 - Panashe EWYL21E0827: Oh its keeping up in the line for your goal

11/08/22, 22:06 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:32 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off

24/08/22, 19:13 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
