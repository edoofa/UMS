16/07/22, 04:41 - Unknown: Greetings Varaidzo!
Happy to see such active participation from your side.
16/07/22, 04:43 - Varaidzo EWYL22E0081: Thank you
18/07/22, 22:31 - Varaidzo EWYL22E0081: I am a proud Edoofian
18/07/22, 22:33 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

21/07/22, 22:52 - Unknown: Greeting of the day Varaidzo!
How's your day going?
21/07/22, 22:54 - Unknown: I have not received your response yet to the weekend activity Varaidzo, may I know why?
In case you are facing any challenges, please let me know, I am there to help you out.
21/07/22, 22:55 - Varaidzo EWYL22E0081: Which weekend activity
21/07/22, 22:55 - Unknown: Along with this, let's move on with our session.
Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our WEDNESDAY Wisdom was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on community building project
3. your pending response to the weekend activity
21/07/22, 22:55 - Varaidzo EWYL22E0081: The mining industry is highly diversfied with close to 40 different minerals .The predominant minerals mined include platinum , coal , goal and diamond only to mention a few.The country boasts  the second largest platinum deposit amd high grade chromium oresin the world .The types of mining in Zimbabwe include strip mining , highwall mining,mountain top removal, open pit mining .
21/07/22, 22:56 - Varaidzo EWYL22E0081: From the wednesday wisdom i grasped that we should not blame people or situations if things fail to go our way the way forward is to work hard and aim at fixing it because blaming people will not solve anything .

And always have a positive mind set the moment one thinks that i can't do this even if it can happen due to the negative thought it would 
not happen. 

Just to add on few more points that was not in the wisdom session but something that came across my mind when i was reading when you want something in life work hard for it because nothing comes in a silver platter .
21/07/22, 22:59 - Unknown: I read your response to your weekend activity and it made me so inquisitive to know about the mining industry I got to know  minerals mined by the industry include platinum, chrome, gold, coal, and diamonds. The country boasts the second-largest platinum deposit and high-grade chromium ores in the world, with approximately 2.8 billion tons of platinum group metals and 10 billion tons of chromium ore.''
Your response is so elaborative and impressive and it provided me with so much knowledge.
21/07/22, 22:59 - Unknown: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.
21/07/22, 23:01 - Unknown: I read your response Varaidzo to the Wednesday wisdom and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
21/07/22, 23:02 - Unknown: Now we are only left with our discussion on the community building project.
21/07/22, 23:24 - Varaidzo EWYL22E0081: ☺️

22/07/22, 04:57 - Unknown: As we discussed earlier Varaidzo, we agreed that you will be getting two forms filled per day under the community building project but I have not received any form lately, may I know why?
Are you facing any challenges, please let me know.
22/07/22, 05:26 - Varaidzo EWYL22E0081: This week students havent responded that's the first challenge the second one is i haven't been feeling well but i am now recovering i will make sure i cover much group tomorrow.

Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
26/07/22, 01:09 - Varaidzo EWYL22E0081: Yeah hey
26/07/22, 01:09 - Varaidzo EWYL22E0081: growth mindset of successful people and how will you make sure you develop the same mindset*.

I for one have noticed how successful people take their issues at hand they don't go around blaming everyone for their failures but they stand up and own up to them. Where as with the Nun successful people they look for people to blame instead of owning up to their problem.

I strive on  having a positive mind set, willing to work hard to be achieve my goals and succeed.

26/07/22, 17:48 - Unknown: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

Yesterday I had an amazing day. I went to the airport to receive all my proud Edoofians and I had tears in my eyes seeing their happiness and enthusiasm. I want you to look at it and share your thoughts with me.
26/07/22, 17:50 - Unknown: I read your understanding of the activity and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it’s not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you’re looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don’t do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.
26/07/22, 21:07 - Varaidzo EWYL22E0081: This is amazing I a can't wait for the experience as well its a matter of days

The best thing is to write a time table of the things you need to be do e it help manage one's time. Planning ones day helps a lot to see what has been done and what hasn't been done.
29/07/22, 00:35 - Unknown: Your response to the Wednesday wisdom has made me realize our childhood quote  is Money'.
Through Wednesday Wisdom, my main aim was to educate my Edoofians about TIME MANAGEMENT and HOW IT CAN BE ACHIEVED.
You know are very well aware of what Time management means, let me tell you about what Time Management includes:
# Setting goals and objectives
# Setting deadlines
# Delegation of responsibilities
# Prioritizing activities as per their importance

The benefits of Time Management are:
- Time Management makes an individual punctual and disciplined.
- Individuals who stick to a time plan are the ones who realize their goals and objectives within the shortest possible period. 
- Research says that individuals who accomplish tasks on time are less prone to stress and anxiety. 

How can we achieve it:
# Set a goal for yourself.
# Priority matrix (like we talked about in the Wednesday lesson)
# Organize your study space
# Do a SWOT Analysis of yourself.

I am sure you will note all these things and imply in your day-to-day life and do share with me what changes you have felt.
