12/07/22, 23:06 - Tinaye EWYL21E0677: My name is Tinaye matambo in in batch 5 im here for my EWYL session
12/07/22, 23:27 - Aditi Kapoor: Good Afternoon, Tinaye
How are you?
12/07/22, 23:27 - Aditi Kapoor: I am sure that you must have seen your EWYL Group?
12/07/22, 23:29 - Tinaye EWYL21E0677: I think  a student needs  good communication skills to get in some of the projects to earn more scholarship credits . I personally think that good communication skills is the mist basic requirement that one needs as it enhances productivity if any. 
Secondly the student has to be  productive and committed to any task given that only shows that the student will perform better in the projects if one us be given .
And  i think  obedience is the key to everything  . The student should be good at time management so that  everything goes well and one is able to balance  school things and the projects .
12/07/22, 23:29 - Tinaye EWYL21E0677: Afternoon  sir 
Sir you didn't check my reply for the last lesson
12/07/22, 23:30 - Tinaye EWYL21E0677: Yes i have seen it 
And i would like to ask if i should say \" Im a proud Edoofian  \" on a daily basis
12/07/22, 23:32 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
12/07/22, 23:33 - Tinaye EWYL21E0677: Okay thank you

13/07/22, 17:28 - Aditi Kapoor: Good Morning, Tinaye ?
I hope that you are good health and spirits
13/07/22, 17:29 - Aditi Kapoor: Tinaye, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.
This way you will always be recognized by the Academics Board for new projects.
13/07/22, 17:29 - Aditi Kapoor: Can you please share Project Progress Form with me?
13/07/22, 21:47 - Tinaye EWYL21E0677: Good afternoon

14/07/22, 22:54 - Aditi Kapoor: Tinaye, May I know why don't you reach out to me if you are facing challenges in the EWYL Project?

14/07/22, 23:10 - Aditi Kapoor: You mean communication is the weak part?
14/07/22, 23:11 - Tinaye EWYL21E0677: I think so because sometimes when i reach out  to students  its either  they block my contact or they ignore
14/07/22, 23:12 - Tinaye EWYL21E0677: So now im confused if the problem is with me
14/07/22, 23:13 - Aditi Kapoor: May I know what message do you share with them in the start?

19/07/22, 16:34 - Tinaye EWYL21E0677: Wednesday wisdom lesson 

Well from the story i have read it takes one's attention and Requires a very good observer to notice the gap an chances that are there in the market . Now i have come to think of it that Patrice  did an arts degree and also a  law degree. But later was found in the mining sector. It rings a bell that was it that he wasn't passionate about being a lawyer ? , is it that he never wanted to pursue his career. Well those questions  can  be overruled by this answer that Patrice had an open mind and he saw a gap in the market although he was a lawyer he had a business mind and not forgetting that he got sone of the skills from his father's shop .
This have taught me that yes you can have a degree but life can have you do nothing in relation to what you have studied for
19/07/22, 16:34 - Tinaye EWYL21E0677: Thank you
19/07/22, 17:09 - Aditi Kapoor: Good Morning, Tinaye?

25/07/22, 03:17 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:07 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:33 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well.

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
