03/11/23, 17:44 - Winnie EWYL23E0480: How are you Ms Ananya, it's Winnie Machipisa one of your EWYL Students. It is very unfortunate that I have been experiencing some problems with my cellphone. I managed to fix it yesterday, however I am leaving for the village today and will be there for 2 weeks and it is out of network coverage. We reconnect when I return, thank you very much
18/11/23, 16:15 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one – it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!

We hope this message finds you well and thriving in your academic journey. Today, we want to encourage you to step out of your comfort zone and share your hidden talents. Whether you're a budding poet, a passionate musician, a mesmerizing dancer, a gifted painter, or possess any unique skill, it's time to embrace your talent and showcase it with unwavering confidence.

We believe that each one of you possesses a hidden gem within, waiting to be discovered. Your talents are not just hobbies; they are an integral part of who you are. They make you unique and add vibrancy to our academic community.

Why a video, you ask? Well, videos are a powerful medium to convey emotions and connect with others. They allow you to express yourself fully, capturing the essence of your talent. So, poets, we want to see you recite your verses with passion, musicians, let your melodies shine, dancers, grace the screen with your moves, and artists, unveil your creative masterpieces.

Remember, your talent is a gift that deserves to be celebrated and shared. By showcasing your hidden talents, you not only inspire others but also gain the confidence to pursue your passions further. You are required to submit your videos before our next session.

Happy Learning!
