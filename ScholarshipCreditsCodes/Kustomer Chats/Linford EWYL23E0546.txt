Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
21/09/23, 20:44 - Linford EWYL23E0546: Sorry the network just went down during that time
21/09/23, 20:46 - Linford EWYL23E0546: I had a good time reading the lesson on Freelancing. So my understanding on Freelancing is that it is a career path which enables a person to work freely, to choose which projects they want to engage on their own terms.Freelancers are able to offer their services to any client or company on a project by project basic which means they do not have to go into long term employment contracts if they don't want to. Freelancers have got characteristics just the same as for entrepreneurs. They are self employed and they have flexible working hours of work. They are able to offer their services in different fields which might include writing,designing a programming and marketing.
21/09/23, 20:46 - Linford EWYL23E0546: that's my understanding
22/09/23, 14:21 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings
Hope you are well.
22/09/23, 14:22 - Aditi Kapoor: You've made an insightful observation about freelancing and its adaptability. Freelancing indeed empowers individuals to leverage their skills for financial and social value, providing the freedom many desire.
22/09/23, 14:24 - Aditi Kapoor: This concludes my input.
Have a wonderful day ahead!
