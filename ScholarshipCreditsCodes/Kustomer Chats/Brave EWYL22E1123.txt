08/05/23, 16:12 - Brave EWYL22E1123: So firstly, a good decision is a choice that will leave a person with no regrets after the results,meaning, it's a choice whose results are cherishable by even the community we live in our day to day basis. A bad decision leads to painful consequences and can even and up ruining one's life for good.                          .                 It's a fact that nearly or even everyone has an experience of a bad decision .As for me I had one on bad choice of a friend before.This friend of mine was very notorious and even stubborn.He disobeyed non of his elders and I knew non of these characters of him.          Many people tried to advice me on the friendship I was in but I felt like they were jealousy about the two of us.                                                Then this other day,the boy took me out for a walk and whilst there, he promised me a lot of money if I just had a sip of alcohol which he pulled from his satchel and by that time I was only fourteen years old and drug illegal. I refused but from that day onwards, I kept an eye on him so as to see vividly his character. I even went on to search for his side companions only to find a gang of drug dealers. I eventually withdrew from the friendship to start a new life but some of his bad behaviors were already in me.Those days , I hardly listened to my parents' advices .              But after that I realized that the boy was  about to ruin my entire life.
08/05/23, 17:04 - Saloni Rastogi: It's important to note that good decisions bring positive outcomes and no regrets, while bad decisions can have painful consequences. Your story highlights the need to be cautious and consider advice from others.

You eventually realized the negative influence and association with a dangerous group despite the initial dismissal of warnings. Taking steps to distance yourself from that friendship shows resilience and a desire for a better life.
08/05/23, 17:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Remember, learning from mistakes is part of personal growth. Continue to listen to the advice of trusted individuals and make choices that lead to positive outcomes.
08/05/23, 17:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, can you please share your updates on the projects?
08/05/23, 19:17 - Brave EWYL22E1123: Ok ma'am

22/05/23, 22:06 - Brave EWYL22E1123: Inorder for one to be a good leader, there is need for certain considerations or qualities to be mastered.                                   One need to have a skill of communication with his or her own followers. Communication helps in the day to day running of certain organizations we are involved in. If there is no communication among fellow members or partners, the business falls.                                                The second quality needed is hardworking skill.If a leader is lazy then the whole organization tend to collapse. The Edoofa program help us to research, study and analyze hence improving the skill of hardworking. It also helps us communicate with one another on our day to day life
