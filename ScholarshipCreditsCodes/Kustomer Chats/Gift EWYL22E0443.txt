07/10/22, 22:33 - Aditi Kapoor: *Check this out, this is the response I received by one of my students and I am expecting the same out of you*


What I have learnt so far is that there are steps that will help me in managing my exams, assignment, extracurricular and ewyl projects at one go.the first step is to set a vision and it gives me a mind of finding a practical use for my time efficiently.always remembering the bigger picture and spending time on things that move closer to my vision. Secondly is to create a masterlist daily where I will be listing tasks to be done on that particular day and it gives me a picture of what my day is going to look like and remembering all that needed to be done. Thirdly is to find my productive cycle by finding the time of the day when I have a huge amount of focus and energy and start executing the most important task . Lastly is leveraging people, I have to delegate my tasks and make best use of resources available and it helps me increase my work efficiency. I have to believe in others vision and support them to interchange and help me
07/10/22, 22:34 - Gift EWYL22E0443: Sounds great
07/10/22, 22:35 - Aditi Kapoor: Please draft your learnings in this form and send them to me!
