15/07/22, 16:41 - Unknown: Good Morning, Proud Edoofian
I hope that you are in good health and spirits.

While going through our conversation, I noticed that you haven't submitted *Wednesday's Lesson* yet.
The deadline to make the submission is *Thursday* *6 PM*. Please make sure that you submit your response before that because the *Academic Board* keeps a very strict check on these things. 
 
The aim of this activity is to make you aware of the life journey of Patrice Motsepe and how you can inculcate his traits in your daily life.
15/07/22, 16:41 - Unknown: I also noticed that from a long time, You haven't submitted any audio lessons or activities.
Please let me know if you are facing any challenges.
Proud Edoofian, These are not the things that could be taught to someone in school or university but these are very important from your life and career perspective.
This is why these audio lessons and activities become more important.
15/07/22, 18:02 - Elisha EWYL21E0298: Let me share the same with you, i thought the deadline was today 9am?
15/07/22, 18:02 - Elisha EWYL21E0298: Patric Motsepe, is one of the Africa's richest man ranked number six, holding about 1.6 billion networthy,He also Holds LLB degree of law, and worked with several law firms, in the same track he got opportunities to venture into entreprenuership, in the mining sector, With the positive energy he snabed every opportunity that came his way at approached it with negative energy hence producing shocking uprises.

Motsepe's story is a lesson itself, He could venture into different activities but he decided to focus on one activity, which shows in life yoi need to focus on one thing and make sure that you produce the best out of it and make sure that you grab every opportunity it brings you.
15/07/22, 18:45 - Unknown: I am very happy after going through your response. ?
Proud Edoofians, These are the footsteps that we have to follow. The traits that he gained and possessed are not something that could be taught in schools\/ universities. That is why our head coach, Ms. Davi, tries that through every lesson you are able to get one step closer towards gaining these traits and making your career sucessful.
15/07/22, 18:46 - Unknown: Also, Elisha, Please ignore the second message that I shared.
That is not for you.
15/07/22, 20:48 - Elisha EWYL21E0298: Alright sir
15/07/22, 21:15 - Unknown: Elisha, So how is the conversation with the families?
15/07/22, 22:03 - Elisha EWYL21E0298: I had 3 successiful discussion Yesterday and 1 family seems interested and i will be sharing details of their contacts later today sir, the other two just compliment the project that its a good one but showed no interests
15/07/22, 22:16 - Unknown: Great work, Elisha.

◼️Also, If you haven't submitted the Wednesday Lesson yet, Please make sure that you submit it as soon as possible.
