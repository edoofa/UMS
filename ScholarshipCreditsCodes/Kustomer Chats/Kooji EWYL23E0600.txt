21/09/23, 13:05 - Unknown: Good Morning Kooji, I hope you're doing well today. It's always a pleasure to connect with you for our mentoring sessions. üåü
21/09/23, 13:06 - Kooji EWYL23E0600: Good morning thank you
21/09/23, 13:11 - Unknown: Now, let's shift attention to the three projects we've been discussing, particularly the

Community Building and African School Reforms initiatives.
21/09/23, 13:11 - Unknown: Before that , I want to understand that have you gone through the wednesday Lesson?
Kindly share your understanding of the same.
21/09/23, 13:28 - Kooji EWYL23E0600: My understanding of the audio shared on EWYL line is that:
It talks about skills, lessons and experiences that will actually make the Edoofians become more creative and be able to discover themselves.This will then help them develop skills which will aid them in their journey of becoming successful professionals.
The main topic that was under discussion was freelancing which is a dynamic and flexible career path in which people can work on contract and after their services to the clients or companies on project by project basis without really entering into long term employment contract. This is something which is contrary to the tradition approach of employment because students are seen to be working independently in a form of self employed arrangements.
The lesson will teach about instructions and the benefits a student can have through. So the video simply explains on the benefits of the students when the venture into it.
21/09/23, 13:29 - Kooji EWYL23E0600: I shared this yesterday onthe other WhatsApp group.
21/09/23, 13:49 - Unknown: I wanted to take a moment to applaud your fantastic work.

Completing the lesson with such understanding and efficiency is truly commendable.
21/09/23, 13:50 - Unknown: Your grasp of the materials presented in the PDF and your excellent writing skills are highly impressive. It's clear that you're dedicated to your studies and take your learning seriously. Keep up the excellent work, and I have no doubt you'll continue to excel in your projects in the similar manner.

I see a huge potential in you to earn the most scholarship credits as well.
21/09/23, 13:50 - Unknown: Kooji, Could you provide an update on the Community Building project? What progress have you made?


How many community-building forms have you successfully completed, and what is the typical number of students you have engaged with on average?
21/09/23, 14:09 - Unknown: Kooji I am still waiting for your answer.
21/09/23, 15:11 - Kooji EWYL23E0600: Good morning,

04/10/23, 14:59 - Unknown: Hello Kooji

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning

Kindly share your understanding of the same.
06/10/23, 02:26 - Kooji EWYL23E0600: LESSON SHARED
My understanding is that as people, we experience our first sense of belonging at home with our immediate families.As we grow older as individuals, our search for belongingness in
 other areas now begin to increase. 
It is therefore important to a have a better understanding of belonging to the Edoofian community because everyone in the Edoofian community is a very important person as this is essential for every success in ones journey because it provides important aspects such as motivation  support,knowledge, networking, accountability,emotional well being and above all the opportunity to leave a lasting impact, things which help an individual to succeed. 
The above aspects are important for success because they make an individual develope the feeling of belonging to a family greater than oneself through networking opportunities.
Belongingness is some thing that is offered by Edoofa an indication that students are not alone on this journey of developing youthful skills that help lead them on the journey of becoming successful professionals. This is effectively done with the help of the mentors. 
Therefore, in conclusion, the news letters shared by Edoofa are of greater importance because they provide students with reach content of information on what is expected of them as they journey through university process.

08/11/23, 13:09 - Unknown: Good day, Kooji! I'd like to kick off this session with a motivating quote by Robert Frost: "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference." As we gather here today, let's reflect on the path we've chosen, the journey we're on, and how it's shaping our lives.

08/11/23, 14:14 - Kooji EWYL23E0600: Well, the challenges I have faced have been.
1. Coordinating the Edoofa program while in class and at the same time  preparing for the examination.
2. Finding time to go into the community to carry out the Edoofa program as in one of the activity you  assigned me to do.I could have done that well but due to school restrictions since it is a boarding school I could not.  I saw that as a challenge on my part because I did not fulfill that assignment. 
MY TRIUMPH 
1. I feel happy and grateful to be part of the Edoofas and u desire to work extremely hard.
2. The information which I'm currently reading in the Edoofa news letter is   fully equipping me with rich content and knowledge on how to face life and that is really raising the motivation and desire to work extremely hard.
08/11/23, 14:17 - Unknown: Thank you for sharing your challenges and triumphs with me. It's completely understandable that coordinating the Edoofa program with your academic responsibilities can be a real challenge, and I appreciate your dedication to both areas. As for the community activity, it's okay that you couldn't fulfill that assignment due to school restrictions. Sometimes external factors can limit our opportunities, but it's important to work within the boundaries set by your school.

I'm delighted to hear that you're happy and grateful to be part of Edoofa, and your desire to work hard is a valuable trait. The Edoofa newsletter is a fantastic resource for gaining knowledge and motivation, and I'm glad to know it's making a positive impact on you. Keep up the hard work and determination, and remember that facing challenges is a part of personal growth. If you ever need support or have questions, feel free to reach out. I'm here to help you on your journey to success.

Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.
