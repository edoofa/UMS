14/07/22, 21:31 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation.

14/07/22, 21:39 - TAFADZWA EWYL21E0658: Let me share some of my Takings and Inspirations from the story of Mr Patrice Motsepe
14/07/22, 22:05 - TAFADZWA EWYL21E0658: -As it's said that practice makes perfect and no goal is too high for us through hardwork and determination, some of the skills that helped Patrice Motsepe reach high levels of success and emerge victorious are his hard work, believing in himself, passion, ambition and never giving up. 
-He was also committed to  growth and high success rates in his job activities and he managed to impress his bosses by his abilities and the above mentioned skills in the first point
- He was also very eager to learn abundant of things which pushed him to start studying mining business and operations and through his hardwork and commitment, that led to his rise as the first black partner of Bowman Gilfillen law film
- He also discovered a very important skill called finance management and operations and proper planning as well and effectively put it into practical which led to his rise. 
- He also accomplished Mr Strive Masiyiwa's key points to success which said whenever you find an opportunity in life, quickly grab it and utilize it well which led him to establish (ARM) and he managed to make a lot of profits through it and it helped him to emerge as one of 1st black enterprenuers in SA to own a major controlling stake in a publicly listed companies and that led to the growth of his business to greater heights
15/07/22, 00:32 - Unknown: Amazing work on the Lesson task. I saw that Patrice had the wisdom to recognize and grab the opportunities that time brought for him and that is what set him apart from others and made him who he is.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
