26/01/23, 02:03 - Yvette EWYL22E0728: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Yvette and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is  Yvette EWYL22E0728
26/01/23, 23:47 - Yvette EWYL22E0728: I am a proud EDOOFIAN
26/01/23, 23:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

08/04/23, 21:56 - Saloni Rastogi: A] Through WhatsApp community groups:


STEP 1: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME\/MENTOR NAME\/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED
For eg: In your case, it will be-
Yvette\/Saloni\/8APR2023

08/04/23, 21:56 - Yvette EWYL22E0728: That's great
08/04/23, 21:57 - Saloni Rastogi: STEP 2: We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
08/04/23, 21:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

08/04/23, 21:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
08/04/23, 21:57 - Saloni Rastogi: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
08/04/23, 21:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

21/04/23, 15:32 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Our weekly Wednesday wisdom focussed on Napolean Hill's 13 Principles of Success and it deeply talked about 6 such principles that can make you think out of the box.

In our session today on the EWYL Line, we will discuss:
1) What all you learned from those principles?
2) Project Update
21/04/23, 15:34 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' and then I will explain how you can ease on explaining the financial process to students.
21/04/23, 17:34 - Yvette EWYL22E0728: I am a proud EDOOFIAN
21/04/23, 17:38 - Yvette EWYL22E0728: I've learned that is Desire The  Starting  Point  of  All  Achievement .  the  key  to  success  is  to  define  a  goal  and  to  pour  all  of  your energy,  power,  and  effort  into  achieving  it.  It  may  take  many  years  before  you are  successful,  but  if  you  hold  onto  your  desire,  you  will  eventually  attain  what you  seek. Merely  wishing  for  money  will  get  you  nowhere.
21/04/23, 17:38 - Yvette EWYL22E0728: 2.  Faith:  Visualization  of  and  Belief  in  Attainment  of  Desire Faith  is  a  state  of  mind  that  you  must  learn  to  cultivate.  Through  repeating affirmations  and  instructions,  a  state  of  faith  is  created 
successful. 3.  Auto-Suggestion:  The  Medium  for  Influencing  the  Subconscious  Mind Auto-suggestion  is  synonymous  with  self-suggestion.  It’s  the  bridge  between  the conscious  and  the  subconscious  mind.  

  Specialized  Knowledge:  Personal  Experiences  or  Observations There  are  two  types  of  knowledge:  Specialized  and  general.
Knowledge  only  generates money  when  organized  and  specifically  directed  to  a  definite  end.  To  become successful,  you  must  require  specific  knowledge  in  the  area  in  which  you  intend to  make  your  fortune. 
5.  Imagination:  The  Workshop  of  the  Mind Within  your  imagination  is  where  all  plans  are  created  and  formed.  The  only limitation  you  face  depends  on  how  much  you  develop  your  imagination
6. Organized Planning: The Crystallization of Desire Into ActionTo put your plan into action,
Ally yourself with a Master Mind group that consists of people who will helpyou carry out your plan. However, before assembling the group, be sure to ascertain what it is you canoffer each of the members in return for their work.Meet with the group at least twice a week, or more if possible, until a solidplan has been created.Maintain good relations

25/04/23, 14:35 - Yvette EWYL22E0728: According to oxford dictionary desire is a strong feeling for something. So it is a need that is developed in the mind and makes a drive in a person to achieve. This principle help someone to remain focused and dedicated to achieve a specific goal. If the goal is achieved then someone can be successful and have wealth.
For example a business man in Zimbabwe called Esau Mupfumi who manage a fleet of buses and tankers started as a policeman with a single car. Through desire he managed to achieve a lot of wealth

Faith
Is a strong belief in something. So if it is directed towards a goal it will help someone to achieve . It assist as a motivator in achieving a specific goal. For example a business man called Strive Masiiwa believed that mobile networking will one day make him rich so he had faith which made him successful.

Autosuggestion
Is a process that makes you believe in your own ideas and thoughts hence it will guide you to discover new avenues of getting wealth. A popular singer in Zimbabwe by the name Charles Charamba believed in his thoughts and ideas hence he achieved wealth

Specialized knowledge
It is wisdom that is derived from research and study that enables you  to have a base  in a particular area hence a  popular guitarist in Zimbabwe by the name Aleck Macheso started with the knowledge of how to play a guitar . Hence that specialized knowledge helped him to achieve wealth

Imagination is the creation of pictures in someone's mind. It assist in getting to know  something that can be achieved through pictures in someone's head. It is clear that imagination is original . Dreams can be part of imagination, also day dreaming . All helps you to bring out new discoveries. For example a popular South African singer David Tshabalala once said he could here a song rythm during the day and that helped him to compose a song

Organised planning 
Is a systematic organization of a process or stages hence it should have a beginning and end. This helps in organizing the process of getting rich or wealth. A famous business man in Zimbabwe known as Tenda had to organize the routes of his buses to achieve wealth. 

These principles have some challenges or limitations 
Lack of resources ( financial, material , moral support etc)can hinder someone to achieve certain goal. Through perseverance , dedication and consistency someone can get rich. Political changes can affect the principles . Changes in the polices of a country can derail the implementations of the principles. It is through adaptations and innovation  to achieve wealth. 
illhealth can affect the principles . It is through the grace of God and the knowledge of healthy living that assist one to achieve wealth
