The deadline to make the submission is *Thursday* *6 PM*. Please make sure that you submit your response before that because the *Academic Board* keeps a very strict check on these things. 
 
The aim of this activity is to make you aware of the life journey of Patrice Motsepe and how you can inculcate his traits in your daily life.
15/07/22, 16:39 - Unknown: And Please make sure that you submit your understandings in the form of text.
15/07/22, 16:40 - Mudzuri EWYL21E0215: Ok sir I will do that
15/07/22, 17:32 - Mudzuri EWYL21E0215: Annah Mudzuri

From the Wednesday wisdom lesson about Patrice Thopane I understood that , people can learn skills in helping others for instance, Patrice Thopane acquired his knowledge in helping his father selling liquor to mine workers who came to their Spaza shop.

Again, I understood that one needs to be committed to his work given to him or her for example Patrice Thopane's committed to growth and high success rate in his job activities made his boss have a unique interest in him.

Moreover, I learnt that people can study hard to become successful business owners,for instance Patrice Thopane studied hard about mining business besides being a lawyer he could read all kinds of books and articles in every way so that he could have complete understanding and technical know how on the business operate in his mine called Future mining.
Apart from that, I learnt that people should lose hope when facing difficulties in fulfilling their dreams because there are people who believe in our dreams who can offer us help for example when Patrice Thopane faced financial difficulty the bank refused to give him a loan ,Bobby Godsell the Chief Executive officer of Angelo's gold and uranium by that time gave him the support of money he needed knowing about his previous mining contract service and had also observed his zeal to want to venture into the mining business.

In nutshell I can say I learnt a lot from the Wednesday wisdom lesson in Patrice Thopane's history to be a millionaire which I wish I was as genius as him,thank you
15/07/22, 18:37 - Unknown: I am very happy after going through your response. ?
Proud Edoofians, These are the footsteps that we have to follow. The traits that he gained and possessed are not something that could be taught in schools\/ universities.

15/07/22, 22:15 - Mudzuri EWYL21E0215: Mr Faizi the headmaster once asked what will the students gain from this meeting,not being sure if my response was valid to him I just told him that ,for those who were facing challenges to study in India due to huge amounts of fees paid this will be beneficial since they are now being given 50-100tution fee

19/07/22, 20:28 - Unknown: In Zimbabwe, mining has become one of the fast-growing sectors\/businesses. It contributes to a massive 60% of the exports of the country helping grow the economy of the country. The government has also outlined some ambitious plans on quadrupling the sector’s value by 2023. Zimbabwe is a very rich country when it comes to minerals ,there are different mineral mines and all over the country for example natural resources like the great Dyke and thus creating a lot of job opportunities for many Zimbabweans.

Artificial intelligence will be commonplace in mining operations in the near future. Minors could use it to interpret data from smart sensors,to improve operational safety and efficiency of machines. This will transform mining in Zimbabwe into one of the most safest sectors\/occupations of it’s kind.





SWOT ANALYSIS 
Strengths        Weaknesses         Opportunities         Weaknesses 
There is a great potential for finding new mineral deposits as there are a large number of sites for exploration        Underground riches are non renewable resources         Employment opportunities         Pollution of air and drinking water
The gross value added for employees is fast growing due to the sector        There is competition for land with other sectors e.g construction,tourism and agriculture         Attracts investors and gold buying agents        Permanently scars natural resources
It is directly linked to the financial stability of the country        Creates risks e.g pollution, accidents,disruption of landscapes        Attracts people who would fund the machinery         Harms wildlife and habitats

In the future the mining industry is surely to succeed and become bigger than it already is at the moment due to technology also due to the fact that there are many mining grounds still to be found as Zimbabwe is a very rich country in mining areas. The future of mining in Zimbabwe is very bright as electrical equipment will continue to 
20/07/22, 02:44 - Mudzuri EWYL21E0215: Like every country has its history, Zimbabwe has become one of country with best economic, political and social interesting history.In economic history Zimbabwe has become one of the best with the fast growing mining sectors with a massive of 60% of exports helping it to boost it economic side. Zimbabwe has rich minerals such as gold, diamond,coal and also platinum especially in the great dyke area places for instance Zvishavane, Mberengwa,Mashava,Gwanda,Felabusi just to mention a few. With the availability of minerals in these areas,it helped the country to boost it's economy through tourism and exporting minerals and objects , job creation. 

SWOT ANALYSIS
Strength and weakness
There is a great discovery of new mineral deposits
Job creation
Land degradation,water pollution,noise pollution 
Competition for land with other sectors eg construction,tourism and agriculture
Harms both wildlife and workers

Mining industry has already succeed in Zimbabwe and hope so in the future. As for now our current president Mr Emerson Dambudzo Munangagwa has restablished the hwange power station with new machines and other materials,again the Mimosa mine company has build schools such as Mshingwe and offer assistance to schools like shabani primary with buses and extending school buildings hence the future generations will benefit through mining companies.

I hope that you are doing well

As August Intake is right at our doorsteps, So due to this many of our Edoofians will be arriving here in India to kick start their dream journey.?

I feel that it is my duty to make sure that the university has prepared well for their onboarding process.

This is why I would be visiting the universities Today in order to do a personal check up.
Since, This process would take up lots of time that is why we won't be able to connect Today.
However, I am sure that in my absence, You will make sure that you follow the below given things:

1. Make sure to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual at 9 AM Tomorrow.
2. Do submit the Wednesday Lesson before the deadline.

25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
