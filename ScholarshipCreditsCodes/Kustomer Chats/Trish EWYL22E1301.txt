I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.

- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.

Let me check it out
20/11/23, 16:02 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for the delay, I was occupied in a meeting that required my immediate attention but I am all ears now.

Can you please share your views on the Saturday activity?
20/11/23, 16:58 - Trish EWYL22E1301: I am sorry for the delay as well... It was raining heavily and I could not use my gadget
20/11/23, 17:04 - Trish EWYL22E1301: About the Saturday activity
.......
My experience is that one time I was in my exam season
I had to prepare for my exams and the exam dates were drawing near
My laptop that has all the books and information that I wanted to use for the exam formatted itself
I lost all the information
But instead of crying over it I had to stay strong and look for other sources and I learnt that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I was exposed to other sources of information as well and I started doing group discussions which were pretty helpful
It was a lesson that when life doesn't go as you plan, instead of breaking down.... Find other means in that situation, the end result might be even better than when you were in your comfort zone
20/11/23, 18:32 - Saloni Rastogi: Thank you for sharing your experience with the Saturday activity. Your story is truly inspiring and reflects resilience in the face of unexpected challenges. The way you handled the situation during your exam season—facing a laptop malfunction, losing critical information, yet not succumbing to despair—demonstrates incredible strength.
Your proactive approach to seeking alternative sources and engaging in group discussions is commendable. It's a valuable lesson that echoes the idea that adversity can lead to unexpected opportunities for growth. Your positive mindset and willingness to adapt, even in challenging circumstances, undoubtedly contributed to your ultimate success.
20/11/23, 18:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's reconvene on Wednesday for another dose of wisdom and inspiration during our Wednesday Wisdom session. I look forward to our continued learning and growth together. Until then, take care, and have a great day!
21/11/23, 11:14 - Trish EWYL22E1301: Thank you ma'am
Same to you
21/11/23, 15:54 - Saloni Rastogi: Good afternoon Trish!

How are you?
There was an article that I went through this morning and the motivation that I received from it, made me so energetic. Here is a glimpse of it:

Get ready to unleash your potential because you're not just here to keep up; you're here to outshine. The competition? It's the spice that makes success sweeter. In this journey of learning, every test, and every assignment is a chance to outdo yourself. Imagine a world where you consistently surprise even your own expectations. It's not about beating others; it's about becoming a better version of yourself. So, let's tackle challenges with passion, bounce back from setbacks with resilience, and commit to being better than we were yesterday. The world is waiting for the unique brilliance that only you can bring. You've got this!

Your mentor
Ms. Saloni
