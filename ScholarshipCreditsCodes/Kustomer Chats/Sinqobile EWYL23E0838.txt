Will Artificial Intelligence revolutionize our world or render us obsolete?

 As we witness the remarkable progress in AI, we ponder its potential to transform our lives and simultaneously question if it will replace us
15/11/23, 15:54 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy Wednesday! 🌟
Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

16/11/23, 15:36 - Saloni Rastogi: Good afternoon Sinqobile,
I hope this message finds you well. How are you doing today?

I'm thrilled about our session on the EWYL Line happening right now! It's a fantastic opportunity for us to dive into our Wednesday lesson, share our thoughts, and, most importantly, make steady progress on our projects together.
What are you most excited to discuss or work on during our session? Your input is key, and I'm looking forward to a dynamic and engaging conversation.
16/11/23, 15:48 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: Good afternoon ma'am
Firstly I would like to comment on the Alex story . It is a really inspiring and motivating story . They are few people who  can not let their environment influence them and become good people.
16/11/23, 15:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Indeed that is absolutely true!
16/11/23, 15:50 - Saloni Rastogi: What about your vision on the Wednesday lesson?
16/11/23, 16:04 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: It's is to be a successful lawyer. And open a law  firm  . One thing I have learnt from Alex 's story is that if you want to be successful in something  you have to associate your self with people who have experience in what you want to do so that they would guide and mentor you
16/11/23, 16:05 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: Apologies for late replies my network is down
16/11/23, 16:18 - Saloni Rastogi: Absolutely! Your insight about the importance of surrounding yourself with experienced individuals, as highlighted in Alex's story, is commendable. Recognizing that success often comes from learning from those who have walked the path before you is a crucial step towards achieving your goal of becoming a successful lawyer and eventually opening your own law firm.
Your commitment to seeking guidance and mentorship reflects a proactive and determined mindset, setting a strong foundation for your journey ahead. Keep embracing opportunities to learn from those with valuable experience, and continue striving toward your aspirations.
16/11/23, 16:18 - Saloni Rastogi: So Sinqobile for the project, we have to streamline our approach for maximum impact! Here are your options:
16/11/23, 16:18 - Saloni Rastogi: Option 1: *Community-Building Project*
Share 5 forms per week 📋
Cultivate a thriving community 🌱
Encourage connections and contributions 💪

Option 2: *African School Reform Mission Project*
Share 1 school form per week 📚
Transform education in Africa 🌟
Empower the next generation 🎓
16/11/23, 16:18 - Saloni Rastogi: Which path aligns best with our mission? 🌍 Let's make a choice and create change! 🚀
16/11/23, 16:21 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: Community Building Project
16/11/23, 16:23 - Saloni Rastogi: That is splendid, have you thought any way to work on it?
16/11/23, 16:25 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: I think we can connect through social media platforms
16/11/23, 16:28 - Saloni Rastogi: Well, that is a great idea but I more ideas in my mind.
16/11/23, 16:28 - Saloni Rastogi: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
16/11/23, 16:29 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: Oky
16/11/23, 16:29 - Saloni Rastogi: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*

For eg: In your case, it will be-

*Sinqobile/Saloni/16NOV2023*
16/11/23, 16:29 - Saloni Rastogi: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
16/11/23, 16:29 - Saloni Rastogi: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
16/11/23, 16:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
16/11/23, 16:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
16/11/23, 16:32 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: Thus a good idea
16/11/23, 16:42 - Saloni Rastogi: So your task for today will be to form the WhatsApp group and add me. Our aim is to as as many prospective students in the group as many possible.
16/11/23, 16:42 - Saloni Rastogi: There is a trick on how you can excel and increase the number of participants in the group:

1. Give only admin access in the group and share messages in the group that can direct them to your inbox where you can share the information about Edoofa.
Similar to the screenshot that I am sharing with you.

16/11/23, 16:43 - Saloni Rastogi: 2. Once they come to your INBOX, share information about Edoofa with them except for the application form.

3. Afterwards, if they ask for the application form, ask them to share the link of your WhatsApp group with 10 other groups and them share a screenshot with you once they have done that.

4. After they have done it, share the application form with them.
16/11/23, 16:44 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: Oky ma'am
16/11/23, 16:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Have you understood this?
16/11/23, 16:55 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: Yes ma'am I understand I will create the group
16/11/23, 16:55 - Saloni Rastogi: What did you understand about this trick?
16/11/23, 16:59 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: Well if one student ask for  application form I will ask him/her to send my grp link to ten groups . The trick is to have as many people as possible in my group so that I can educate them about Edoofa scholarship program.
16/11/23, 17:00 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: And it's won't be a struggle for me to look for other students
16/11/23, 17:02 - Saloni Rastogi: As we conclude our session today, I want to leave you with a powerful reminder: there's no shortcut to success. It's a journey paved with hard work, fueled by consistency, and sustained by unwavering determination. Remember, when the going gets tough, your commitment to your chosen path will be the guiding force.
The age-old saying holds: "Where there is a will, there is a way." Your willpower is the compass that will navigate you through challenges and lead you to triumphs. Embrace every obstacle as an opportunity to learn and grow, and let your persistence drive your success🔥
I believe in your potential and your ability to achieve great things. As you continue on this journey, know that I am here to support you every step of the way. Your growth is a personal victory and a shared success we celebrate together🤝

20/11/23, 16:22 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: The Saturday activity was about power of resilience. And I think young people to be resilient. They need to know what they want in future and set their goals . In that case they will be able to overcome challenges they face and be resilient.
20/11/23, 18:40 - Saloni Rastogi: I completely agree with your perspective on resilience, especially in the context of our Saturday activity focusing on the power of resilience. Encouraging young people to define their future aspirations and set clear goals is indeed a crucial step in fostering resilience. This proactive approach not only empowers them to navigate challenges but also provides a roadmap for overcoming obstacles and achieving success. Your emphasis on the importance of self-awareness and goal-setting aligns perfectly with our mission to guide and inspire the next generation. Well said!

Get ready to unleash your potential because you're not just here to keep up; you're here to outshine. The competition? It's the spice that makes success sweeter.

The world is waiting for the unique brilliance that only you can bring. You've got this!

23/11/23, 14:05 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: The power of competitive spirit
It is important for one to be competitive. Competition pushes one to work hard , the spirit of competition motivates others to be successful in life . If one is competitive they reach new heights in success like Steve Jobs , there is no brand which beats the apple on electronic gardgets .   A competitive person is always a step ahead of others in the industry. Competitive spirit boost others with moral , confidence and such people do not give up easily until they are successful. Hence competition is important to push us to great heights in future.
23/11/23, 15:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Good afternoon,

Your concise and impactful paragraph effectively highlights the significance of competition in propelling us toward greater success in the future. Well done!
23/11/23, 15:50 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: Oky ma'am
23/11/23, 15:50 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: We can begin our session
23/11/23, 15:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share what you progress have you made for the projects so far?
23/11/23, 15:57 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: I have a few students who said they want to talk to their parents before they apply so am waiting for their reply . 

On project 2 the one of companies. I haven't started.  I want to do it as soon as I close schools for the holidays
23/11/23, 16:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me first clarify that there are three projects.
The first project is the corporate alliance project which talks about companies
The second project is the community building project that talks about bringing more people into the family.
The third project is the African School project which talks about partnering with schools.
23/11/23, 16:07 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: Oky I understand which means  right now am doing the community project to bring more people into the family. And the the third project will start it soon

The first project will do it over the holidays.
23/11/23, 16:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Sure, may I know if you have complete clarity on community building project?
23/11/23, 16:22 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: I think so 
According to my understanding community building is about spreading news about Edoofa scholarship program. Explaining to them how the program works and convince the to apply for the scholarship
23/11/23, 16:23 - Saloni Rastogi: That is great Sinqobile, may I know what you think about working on it?

Don't worry,after you share your thoughts, I will share how my bright students are working on it.
23/11/23, 16:30 - Sinqobile EWYL23E0838: First I was thinking about spreading the to my community. We usually have meetings on weekends where we have guidance and cancelling for young people. 

Secondly create group where I would add Friends from Zim and South Africa and spread the word to them
