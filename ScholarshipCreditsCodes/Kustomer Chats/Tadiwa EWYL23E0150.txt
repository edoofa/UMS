29/08/23, 19:36 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

Hope you are doing well, I would like to announce that tomorrow is a holiday on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan which is an auspicious Indian Festival so I am sharing the lesson with you today!

So for this week's Wednesday lesson,  I have an exciting topic to delve into: Hidden Talent.
We'll dive into the captivating story of Samuel, a character whose seemingly ordinary life takes a fascinating turn when his secret talent comes to light. Through his story, we'll discover the power of talents that lie beneath the surface, waiting for the perfect moment to shine.
So, bring your curiosity and imagination as we delve into Samuel's tale and discuss the significance of hidden talents in our own lives. You might even find yourself reflecting on your own unique abilities that are yet to be revealed.

In our upcoming session I would like to know if you have a hidden talent that you're particularly good at or passionate about? It could be anything – from artistic pursuits to something more unexpected.

Get ready to be inspired, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together!

From his letter l black listed the line "Don't be shy to show your talent to the world because that same gift may make you a successful person in the world." I black listed this because recently before you asked me about my hidden talent l was shy to express it to the world even my friends at school but your words dear mentor and Vincent's words evolved around me deeply. This is so because right now l have carefully planned to make videos singing during my spare time and post on social media to showcase my passion of music. This is all possible with the one and only loving Edoofa family 😊💫. I am also seeking to pass my testimony in the long run about my music journey in the near future. # IAM A PROUD EDOOFIAN😊🤩 and always be!!
