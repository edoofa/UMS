We discussed creating a structured study schedule, active learning techniques, and staying healthy and positive during exams. Now, I'd like you to share your understanding of these strategies📚

Interesting Fact💡: Did you know that research shows that taking regular short breaks during study sessions can actually improve concentration and retention? It's a small change that can make a big difference in your learning journey.

15/09/23, 17:03 - Juliet EWYL22E1312: my understanding towards these strategies is that one should or i can say i must analyze my individual learning style, evaluate my current commitments, Plan my study time for each class, Develop a schedule, Set realistic goals, Make study time part of my routine, and Plan my breaks well . that way im sure i will be able to conquer exam fear and fever.
