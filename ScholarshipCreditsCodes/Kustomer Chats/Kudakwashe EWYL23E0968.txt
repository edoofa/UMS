05/01/24, 12:14 - Kudakwashe EWYL23E0968: Yeah l liked the video
05/01/24, 16:35 - Ananya: Please accept my apologies for not being able to connect with you today. I was engaged in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

Considering that more than half of our scheduled time has already passed, I believe it would be wise to reschedule our session for the next available slot. In the meantime, I'd like to share that around this time last year, I implemented a monthly target system for my students based on their fees. They set financial goals for each month to cover their tuition expenses, and it proved to be highly beneficial. Many of them arrived in India with one semester's worth of fees saved, thanks to a year of planning. Recently, they successfully redeemed their credits to pay their tuition fees, fulfilling my wish for their financial success.

I am considering implementing a similar approach for you. Today, I encourage you to invest your free time in planning out this month by setting a target for yourself. Your monthly goal should be a minimum of $100. I wish you the best of luck, and I look forward to receiving your prepared plan by our next session. Good luck!
05/01/24, 16:39 - Kudakwashe EWYL23E0968: Okay that's fine .

Then l try my best

Before beginning today's session, I want you to check out this incredible post :

19/01/24, 15:59 - Kudakwashe EWYL23E0968: Okay l can do that at night for now I don't have data
19/01/24, 15:59 - Kudakwashe EWYL23E0968: Afternoon how are you
19/01/24, 15:59 - Ananya: I have noticed that you did not follow your EWYL ritual yesterday, and therefore, you have missed your Wednesday lesson. I hope you understand that it is crucial to follow your ritual on a daily basis; only then will you receive the lessons and activities! I hope you won't miss it next time.
19/01/24, 16:02 - Kudakwashe EWYL23E0968: Okay I understand  that
19/01/24, 16:06 - Ananya: For today, I want to discuss something really important:

19/01/24, 16:07 - Kudakwashe EWYL23E0968: Okay that's fine
19/01/24, 16:09 - Ananya: So, tell me do you know about a resume or a cv?
19/01/24, 16:12 - Kudakwashe EWYL23E0968: Yeah resume is to start again something for example continue something from the past
19/01/24, 16:16 - Kudakwashe EWYL23E0968: Cv is when someone apply for something send an email or something written down
19/01/24, 16:18 - Ananya: Kudakwashe, well that's right however I am talking about another one! You know, a resume is like a super important paper for students. It shows all the cool things you've done in school and outside. When you want to get into a good school or get a job, you give them your resume so they can see how awesome you are. It's like your personal advertisement that says, 'Hey, I'm really good at these things, and I can do great stuff for you!' So, having a good resume helps you stand out and get cool opportunities.
19/01/24, 16:21 - Kudakwashe EWYL23E0968: Yeah that's right
19/01/24, 16:23 - Ananya: Well, yesterday I was updating my little brother's resume and took help from this video. I thought to share this with you as well, as he is suggesting some really good things!

19/01/24, 16:31 - Ananya: Now, we are preparing ourselves for some external projects. Meanwhile, to grasp this amazing opportunity, we must also work toward our EWYL projects.

To ace those projects and ensure regular input from your end, let's set a target for this week. However, this time I want to ask you to set your own target!
19/01/24, 16:33 - Kudakwashe EWYL23E0968: Okay that's fine.but on students  or there is something  else
19/01/24, 16:37 - Ananya: Yes, you can set a target either for the students or for the school reform project!
19/01/24, 16:43 - Kudakwashe EWYL23E0968: Okay that's fine l choose students since I'm not closer to the school
