Through social media I will be posting on my Facebook, Instagram as well as uhm WhatsApp story and status about Edoofa and what it does and compelling people to join and be a part of this amazing adventure as well
17/11/23, 14:33 - Aditi Kapoor: That sounds like a comprehensive plan! Visiting nearby schools, engaging with A level students, and discussing the potential collaboration with the principals is a proactive approach. Utilizing social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp to spread awareness about Edoofa is a great way to reach a broader audience. Your efforts to promote this opportunity and encourage others to join the Edoofa journey are commendable. If you encounter any challenges or need further guidance, feel free to share.

29/11/23, 15:46 - Aditi Kapoor: Nyasha, I am well. Thanks for asking.
May I have your Saturday Activity, please.
29/11/23, 21:20 - Nyasha EWYL23E0727: Well ,,the spirit of competition plays a pivotal role in one's road to success  as it pushes a person to go the extra mile to be willing to uhm to get out of their comfort zone ryt to look for or to find something that can set them apart
29/11/23, 22:18 - Nyasha EWYL23E0727: Well the spirit of competition helped me during exams when we were approaching our final exams and I started competing with myself as well as my friends which helped me study harder to get more grades than I had gotten before as well as some of my friends which helped me take that extra mile of sleeping late ,studying each and every second and so forth
29/11/23, 23:56 - Aditi Kapoor: That's a fantastic application of the spirit of competition! Competing with yourself and your friends during exam preparations can indeed be a powerful motivator to push your limits and strive for continuous improvement.
It's impressive to hear that you took that extra mile by sacrificing sleep and dedicating yourself to studying intensely. This level of commitment and determination often leads to not only better grades but also a deeper understanding of the subject matter. The process of competing with oneself fosters a mindset of self-discipline and a desire for personal growth.
30/11/23, 00:16 - Nyasha EWYL23E0727: Yes ma'am, it is indeed

01/12/23, 18:58 - Nyasha EWYL23E0727: Okay ,,well analytics is quite important and it is something that most people take for granted which sometimes leads to bad decision making as well as regret .
01/12/23, 19:00 - Nyasha EWYL23E0727: Analysis helps as u first consider both sides of a situation before making a decision, for instance one ought to consider the benefits and drawbacks of a situation before investing in it
01/12/23, 20:00 - Aditi Kapoor: Absolutely, your recognition of the importance of analysis is spot on. Indeed, it's a valuable tool that is often overlooked. Analyzing situations thoroughly before making decisions is a wise approach. Considering both the benefits and drawbacks allows for a more informed decision-making process, minimizing the chances of regrets. It's great that you acknowledge the significance of analytical thinking in navigating various aspects of life. Keep embracing this mindset, and it will serve you well in making sound and thoughtful choices. Well done!
