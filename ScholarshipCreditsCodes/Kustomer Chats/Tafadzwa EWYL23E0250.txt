I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
29/06/23, 14:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
29/06/23, 14:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *12:00-01:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
29/06/23, 14:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?

30/06/23, 15:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Tafadzwa!
How are you?
30/06/23, 15:53 - Saloni Rastogi: I am glad to see this excitement!
30/06/23, 15:54 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know which project will you be working on in the month of July with full focus?
30/06/23, 16:09 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0250: Greetings Ms Saloni. My apologies. Network is really bad this side
30/06/23, 16:10 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0250: I want to work on community building project this July
30/06/23, 16:13 - Saloni Rastogi: That's great!
May I know what is your understanding of the project and how will you work on it?
30/06/23, 16:22 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0250: I am going to look for my friends, those in upper six and those who finished their ALevel some few years back who wish to study abroad and link them to Edoofa through having them to fill in the application form. I will also get in touch with schools administrators. These I will link them to Edoofa so that their students will be provided with the same opportunity to study abroad. Also administrators will have an opportunity for their members of staff who wish to futher their studies in India to do that
30/06/23, 16:24 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, that's great!
Few days back we discussed with the entire project discussion and we discussed about forming a group and how we can add different participants in the group.
30/06/23, 16:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Do you know about them?
30/06/23, 16:32 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0250: Yes. That I creat a group with you and name it Tafadzwa/Saloni and the date the group was created. Add people in that group by sharing the group link and advertise Edoofa in that group. All interested and serious individuals l give them the offline application form to fill. Also we discussed on me joining groups of my friends in the school say of 20 20 individuals and let them know about Edoofa once I am  in those groups
30/06/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi: That's great, you have got it well.
I am sharing audio by our highest earner Persistance Muza where he talks about what helped him to earn more than $4,800 in scholarship credits in this journey.
Once you listen to it, do let me know how you find this idea.
30/06/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi: .
30/06/23, 17:19 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0250: As Edoofians we should provide comprehensive information about Edoofa to aspiring students,  kindly asking them to fill in the application form and requesting ourselves to be added in their groups. Utilizing social media such as Whatsapp will help greatly because it is widely used by students. We should try to use persuasive language so that we attract so many students. We should also try to respond to students as soon as they join in the group and not to ignore them. We also should share the application to those who show interest.  Also of importance is to develop our pride as proud Edoofians not just to talk about it. Lastly it's not enough to just share a form with students but to make follow ups and to regularise the process.

01/07/23, 15:55 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!

Check out this short but important reel which defines Edoofians!

Tell us if you have achieved them in the comments below!
02/07/23, 02:29 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0250: Naturally, I am a self motivated individual who is driven by the desire to achieve whatever I set out to do. One summer season, our community was plunged into turmoil after the was a sudden rise in cases of theft. This scenario puzzled everyone since our community was generally  peaceful and crime free. 

All of a sudden, the tranquility that characterise our environment was disturbed by a spate of thefts that engulfed our community. Just like all members of the community, I did not like what was going on. Personally I was keen to play my part in bringing this menace to an end. I convinced myself that I must take a leading role in the fight against crime.

Definitely I could not win the war against crime alone. I had to mobilise and convince others to join me in this spirited fight against crime. Obviously this was no easy task. The criminals were not going to give up without a fight. I had to be upto the task if I was to achieve my objective of curbing crime in the community. 

I sold my idea to a few friends hopping they would easily join me in this war against crime. To my surprise not everyone was going to buy into my idea. I was not deterred by the look warm response I got from the community. I was not going to give up easily. Infact I was determined to uproot the cancer of crime that had taken rout in our community. 

The cases of theft continued to rise. Something definitely had to be done as a matter of urgency. I quickly organized young people in the neighborhood to meet and strategise on how to deal with the problem. When we met, it was very difficulty establish common ground. Individuals in the group differed on how to tackle the problem. 

The response from the majority of people in the group was not pleasing. Infact it was quite discouraging. It was as if there was no solution at hand as we argued to no end over how to deal with problem, the problem intensified. I was moz determined than ever to deal with the problem.

I quickly identified members of the group who shared my vision. I formed a smaller group of like-minded individuals. The zeal and enthusiasm to deal with the situation at hand in the new group was quite encouraging. I suggested that we should form a neighborhood watch committee. As a team we quickly establish teams of young and energetic people. The teams would patrol around the community at odd hours looking for any signs of criminal activity. The whole idea was to identify any awkward movements by the locals and strangers. 

The intial efforts to fight crime by the neighborhood watch  teams yielded nothing. Some members in the groups were on the verge of giving up. As the leader l kept on encouraging members of the group to stick together and to continue with the night patrols. I was eager to bring tangible results. I knew with perseverance  something good would be definitely achieved. 

One Friday night when we were on our routine patrols, we observed three strangers suspiciously moving in the community. We collectively decided to track the trio and observed their activities and movements. The three were really up to no good but it seemed they sensed that they were being followed. As we were about to abandon the operation the three strangers moved towards a certain homestead. The owners of the homestead were away on holiday. One of the three men went to the gate and broke the key. The three hurriedly entered the premise. Finally the cat was out of the bag. I quickly called the police who did not disappoint, they quickly came to the scene and the three men were caught in the act. They had broken into the house. The police officer in charge of the operation thanked me for my bravery and determination. From then onwards members of the community came out in full support of the neighborhood watch intiative
02/07/23, 03:39 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0250: Edoofians are actually defined by their special qualities. These qualities I feel am achieving them. I am managing to come Africa and enjoy my studying in India. I am going through the  special guidance from qualified and  very patient mentor. Am also a beneficiary of the;EWYL program where am supposed to self finance my education by earning some scholarship credits. I am also going to learn the second language

10/07/23, 07:32 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0250: In this journey of life, we interact with different people. These different characters we come across in the adventure of life impact on our lives in many different ways. Personally I have been privileged to work with Mr Shiri 

Mr Shiri is our school volleyball team coach. He is a unique character. He is so consistent in his behavior. Naturally he enjoys working with young people. So many young sports persons have passed through his hands. 

I have always wondered what keeps Mr Shiri going and consistent. He can not  easily be swayed from his path. He is a patient individual, who does not easily give up on anything. In our journey of volleyball together we have met so many setbacks as a team. Mr Shiri has always been there to cheer us up. Even after a morale draining lose, Mr Shiri would be the first to arrive at the training grounds. He would encourage us to focus on the next volleyball assignment. That kind of attitude naturally made him a consistent character

I have always wondered what keeps Mr Shiri going and consistent. He can not  easily be swayed from his path. He is a patient individual, who does not easily give up on anything.

Even after a morale draining lose, Mr Shiri would be the first to arrive at the training grounds. He would encourage us to focus on the next volleyball assignment. That kind of attitude naturally made him a consistent character who remain faithful to his cause.

For one to be consistent one has to be devoted and committed to his goal. Mr Shiri is always committed and devoted to building a strong and united team. Because of his determination as a coach we have achieved great things as a team. We have been provincial champions two times in the last four years.

Time management is a very important component if one is to be consistent. Mr Shiri manages his time well. He is rarely late for his training sessions. He definitely leads by example. Usually Mr Shiri is the first person to arrive at the training grounds and he consistently lays out a clear training program. His punctuality is outstanding and that enables him to meet his targets

To achieve in life one has to be self motivated. Mr Shiri is an intrinsically motivated individual. It is there for all to see that the man enjoys what he does. The man just loves the game of volleyball. Because of that passion for the game Mr Shiri is so consistent. Year after year he has taken the school team to the provincial finals. 

In his journey of volleyball Mr Shiri has encountered so many challenges. If he was just like any other person he would have given up a long ago. He is a resilient character who always finds the strength and courage to soldier on with his journey. He is definitely a man of all seasons. He has been through it all happiness and sorrow. Whatever the season he will always wear a broad smile. I believe such a trait makes him a consistent character. 

Overally Mr Shiri's character inspires me so much. I am sure if I follow in his footsteps l can achieve great things in life. One definitely has to be consistent to achieve great things. However it is important to note that to make a dish a dish of consistency you need so many ingredients

Consistency is indeed a valuable trait in achieving success and making a positive impact in our journeys. Mr Shiri's dedication, commitment, and resilience are truly inspiring. His ability to remain consistent, even in the face of setbacks, is a testament to his character and the positive influence he has on the team.

11/07/23, 16:38 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0250: On community building project I am working with 2 headmasters whom I wish to send their details very soon to you
11/07/23, 16:44 - Saloni Rastogi: You have formed a WhatsApp group for a community building project?
11/07/23, 16:52 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0250: Not yet I am working on it
11/07/23, 16:54 - Saloni Rastogi: .

11/07/23, 16:57 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0250: Yes it's my group
11/07/23, 17:04 - Saloni Rastogi: There is a trick on how you can excel and increase the number of participants in the group for community building project:

1. Give only admin access in the group and share messages in the group that can direct them towards your inbox where you can share the information about Edoofa.
Similar to the screenshot that I am sharing with you.
11/07/23, 17:04 - Saloni Rastogi: .
11/07/23, 17:09 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0250: Hoooo I see. I understand now. Thank you
11/07/23, 18:24 - Saloni Rastogi: .
11/07/23, 18:25 - Saloni Rastogi: 2. Once they come to your INBOX, share information about Edoofa with them except for the application form.

3. Afterwards, if they ask for the application form, ask them to share the link of your WhatsApp group with 10 other groups and them share a screenshot with you once they have done that.

4. After they have done it, share the application form with them.
11/07/23, 18:42 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0250: Ok thanks
11/07/23, 18:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Any help or assistance you require from on this, please let me know.

11/07/23, 18:46 - Saloni Rastogi: I will end this session by saying that "Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out."
Here is a short story that talks about consistency. 

In a small village, there was a girl named Maya who dreamed of becoming a skilled violinist. Every day, she practiced tirelessly, even when she felt tired or discouraged. Despite facing obstacles along the way, Maya never gave up. Her consistency paid off as her skills improved. Eventually, she performed on a grand stage, captivating the audience with her beautiful music. Maya's story reminds us that consistent effort leads to success. So, let her inspire you to stay committed to your goals, for greatness comes to those who persist.
