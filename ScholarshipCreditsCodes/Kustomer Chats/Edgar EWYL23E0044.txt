25/04/23, 10:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian, ready for a motivational monday?

In a remote village, there lives a hardworking farmer who owns a farm. Over the years his grapery yields rich crops, and the farmer is very successful. He has three sons, who are young and energetic but never worry about working. As the farmer grows older, he begins to worry about his sons’ future.

Then he becomes very ill and feels that his death is coming soon. He calls his sons and says,

“Dear sons, I see my death approaching, but I want to share a secret before you all leave. These areas have treasure hidden inside. Dig the whole area after my death, to find it. ”

The old farmer died. The sons start digging for money without leaving any part of the field but nothing is found. In any case, digging their fields leads to healthier crops and results in higher incomes. These earnings make the sons realize what their father means.

What according to you is the moral of the story?

a. Hard work always pays off. The fruits of hard work are always sweet.
b. Be Selflessly kind
c. both a & b
25/04/23, 10:43 - Edgar EWYL23E0044: C
25/04/23, 10:44 - Edgar EWYL23E0044: I liked the story the way the farmer taught his Children to farm psychologically

I have also attached the newsletter with you for the last week.

2. Projects
02/05/23, 18:34 - Saloni Rastogi: In our last Wednesday Wisdom lesson, we discussed the principles from the book "Think and Grow Rich" by Napoleon Hill. For this week's Saturday Activity, please share your understanding of these principles and tell us which one you found easiest to apply in your life and which one was the most difficult, and explain why.
Your submission should be a minimum of 300 words and should include examples from your own life or from the lives of people you know. This assignment is designed to help you reflect on the principles of success and how they can be applied in your own life.
02/05/23, 18:35 - Saloni Rastogi: You said that you want to work on the community building project, may I know how will you be doing that?

05/05/23, 12:43 - Saloni Rastogi: Dear Proud Edoofian,

I hope you are doing well. This message serves as a gentle reminder for your Wednesday lesson. It is important to continue learning and developing your skills in order to advance in your career. Please take some time to go through the lesson, take notes on any important information, and complete the assigned tasks. Remember, investing in yourself is always a wise decision.

Happy learning!
05/05/23, 15:59 - Edgar EWYL23E0044: Just wanted to ask when will I submit this document
05/05/23, 19:47 - Edgar EWYL23E0044: I've finally read the document was quite busy. It was wonderful reading it. Actually it made me realize a lot of mistakes I have been making in my life. Most of the time I have dedicated myself to lot of work yet I could not accomplish any. The document changed the way I think. I always thought being fast is the key to everything but I have come to realize that I've been making poor decisions. The same thing happened when I wrote my A level exams, I was the first to finish. Later at home I realized I had made lots of mistakes and If I would have been slower I would have collected more marks. From today onwards I plan on focusing on one thing at a time allowing myself to think more and yielding good results. Again thank you this was very helpful
06/05/23, 13:31 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Edgar!
How are you?
06/05/23, 13:32 - Saloni Rastogi: Please follow the daily ritual for today.
06/05/23, 13:33 - Saloni Rastogi: I'm glad to hear that you found the document insightful and that it has had a positive impact on your perspective. It's great that you have recognized the mistakes you've made and have gained a new understanding of the importance of taking your time and focusing on one thing at a time.
06/05/23, 13:35 - Saloni Rastogi: Remember, it's never too late to make positive changes in your approach. By allowing yourself more time to think and make informed decisions, you'll likely see improvements in the results you achieve. Taking a slower and more thoughtful approach can lead to better outcomes and help you avoid unnecessary errors.
06/05/23, 13:38 - Saloni Rastogi: On increasing the number of participants, what you can do is:

1) Keep the group updated DAILY.
2) Try reaching out to students from different schools 
3) Try reaching out to teachers from your school or others and ask them to share the link to your WhatsApp group with other school teachers from different schools
4) In the group just:
-please give 'only admins' access
-just ask the students/participants to DM you to know about Edoofa and to get the form
-once they DM you, share about Edoofa with them
-Before sharing the form, ask them to get you added to their school groups
-once they do that, then only share the form with them.​
​5) Use social media as your sword to tell people about Edoofa
6) Use Facebook groups, I am sharing a screenshot that will help you understand that there are various groups on Facebook that you can join and share information about Edoofa also forward the link to your WhatsApp group there.

09/05/23, 14:57 - Edgar EWYL23E0044: In life one is will always face a situation where they have to make decisions. Decisions can be bad or good. A good decision will yield positive results to the decision maker. Some of the characteristics of a good decision include, personal growth and development. It may also lead to development of a community. Good decisions are not always made consciously. Some decisions are accidental, one can make a decision without thinking and later on realize that the decision he or she made had either changed his or her life or changed the life of others. Good decisions result in individuals being known for changing lives.                                                                    The people I admire a lot, who face situations where they have to make a decision are doctors, a doctor will face a situation where they have to make tough decisions especially surgions. For example sometimes doctors can face a situation where they have to Save either the mother or the unborn child. In most situation we are faced with challenges that require us to make decisions. On the other hand bad decisions usually yield bad results and they result in individuals suffering from regret most of the time. Bad decision affect not only the life of oneself but also the life of many.  In making decisions one should not only look at his or her life only, but it is important that you consider the effects of your decisions on the life of others.  One should use critical thinking when making decisions. Some decisions are tough and others are simple. In my life I have faced situations where I had to make decisions that would affect the rest of my life. For example a student of mine came across a group which helped students attain scholarships. Without thinking much and also without allowing any negative thoughts to flood my mind I quickly signed up for the scholarship. I faced so many negative thoughts from others saying this indian scholarship is fack, but I did not take their thoughts into my mind. From this I have learned people will discourage you from  making good decisions. They will speak nagative towards something they don't even know. Signing up for edoofa scholarship program was the best decision I ever made in my life. Now I know I can persue my education and help build a better future not only for me but for everyone around me. Good decisions are always the best as one will never suffer any regret from making them. I have learned that people will always say nagative and positive, but above all it's always up to you to make your own decisions.
09/05/23, 18:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Fantastic job! You've provided a thoughtful analysis of decision-making and highlighted the significance of good decisions in personal growth and community development. Your understanding that good decisions can have positive impacts, even if they are made unconsciously or accidentally, shows a nuanced perspective. It's commendable that you recognize the importance of considering the effects of decisions on others and the need for critical thinking. Your personal example of signing up for the scholarship despite negative opinions demonstrates resilience and the ability to trust your own judgment. Your insight that people may discourage you from making good decisions but it's essential to stay determined is inspiring.
09/05/23, 18:43 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know the updates on the projects?
09/05/23, 18:44 - Edgar EWYL23E0044: Thank you mam
