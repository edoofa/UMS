13/07/22, 23:55 - Vimbainashe EWYL21E0844: Yes ma'am
14/07/22, 00:46 - Unknown: It's time for Wednesday Wisdom, and this week we're going to learn how the son of a former teacher in an African school made over $1 billion dollars. You did read it correctly.
When I read the lesson, I personally learned a lot. In the lecture, some of the top success secrets are revealed.

Be sure to thoroughly read the PDF document, and if you choose, you can note down things that you liked or were inspired by and we can discuss them in our session on *Thursday- 10 AM*

Happy studying!
14/07/22, 00:47 - Unknown: Also, tomorrow I will discuss the procedure about notification of the session with you.
14/07/22, 01:31 - Vimbainashe EWYL21E0844: Thank you
14/07/22, 01:31 - Vimbainashe EWYL21E0844: Noted
14/07/22, 15:48 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian!

14/07/22, 17:46 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
14/07/22, 18:02 - Unknown: Before we move forward with activities and lessons I want to make sure that you know what kind of a relationship we share and why you need to be in contact constantly!

This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
