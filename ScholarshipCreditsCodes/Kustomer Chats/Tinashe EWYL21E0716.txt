12/07/22, 22:46 - Tinashe EWYL21E0716: Hello sir I'm here for my EWYL Session
12/07/22, 22:47 - Tinashe EWYL21E0716: But first let me submit my Saturday activity before the clock strikes 3pm
12/07/22, 22:56 - Unknown: Yes, Tinashe
I am sure that you must have seen your EWYL Group?
12/07/22, 23:03 - Tinashe EWYL21E0716: For someone to be given projects that are challenging and bring the best out of them they need to have the following aspects 
1.*Integrity* this is the first thing that one must have if he or she is to receive these project since it is the backbone of all other aspects that I'm to list
2.*Panctuality*
If one is panctual then he or she is likely to finish these projects on time.
3.*Determination* - when is determined to something then it is more likely that they will do their task whole heartedly and this results in perfection on their tasks and projects .
4.*Versatility*  when a student is regarded as versatile then he can be able to do any type of project even though it might not be his line of specialisation
Lastly a student should be available and contactable since communication is the key to success between any two parties when archiving a common goal.
12/07/22, 23:05 - Tinashe EWYL21E0716: Yes sir and I have replied accordingly
12/07/22, 23:05 - Tinashe EWYL21E0716: I am a proud Edoofian
12/07/22, 23:07 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

13/07/22, 17:13 - Unknown: Good Morning, Tinashe?
I hope that you are good health and spirits
13/07/22, 17:14 - Unknown: Tinashe, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.
This way you will always be recognized by the Academics Board for new projects.
13/07/22, 17:14 - Unknown: Can you please share Project Progress Form with me?

The aim of this activity is to make you aware of the life journey of Patrice Motsepe and how you can inculcate his traits in your daily life.

We will be continuing with where we left in our scheduled session next week.
I wanted to inform you that I won't be active on the EWYL DEDICATED LINE this weekend. I have dedicated this weekend to the Edoofians who are in India. I will be getting on calls with them and checking how everything is going.

I would want you to follow the points given below:
◼️Make sure that you follow the Proud Edoofian ritual (Even on Sunday?)
◼️Keep an eye on the Saturday Activity that will be shared in your batch group
◼️Also, If you haven't submitted the Wednesday Lesson yet, Please make sure that you submit it as soon as possible.
◼️I would like to you work diligently on the EWYL Projects and submit your Project Progress Form in our next scheduled session.

I wish you a blessed and a joyful weekend ahead✨

May I know what happened to your cellphone, Tinashe?
And Would you be able to atleast perform the Proud Edoofian ritual?
18/07/22, 18:07 - Tinashe EWYL21E0716: Yes the ritual 8 can perform, the problem is that I am sharing the phone with my mom so due to the load shedding crisis, she leaves with it for work and when she comes back the phone will be out of power
So the bottom line is that I have to look for another battery
18/07/22, 18:12 - Unknown: Okay, Tinashe.
No worries.
We can connect on Wednesday.
Just make sure that you keep performing the Proud Edoofian Ritual, okay?

22/07/22, 00:55 - Tinashe EWYL21E0716: Nothing much just that I should submit the last Wednesday wisdom and Saturday activity as soon as possible
22/07/22, 04:18 - Tinashe EWYL21E0716: One thing I learnt or rather liked from the story of Motsepe is that he came from humble beginnings,things were not just handed over to him by parents but rather his anticipation towards mining and business law helped him to be where he is today
Also his determination to grow is another aspect of him that I admire ....he is an ultimate chance- grabber
22/07/22, 04:18 - Tinashe EWYL21E0716: ****** *Saturday activity*******

The fastest growing business in my country is the Technoelogical industry. You see sir with African countries now realizing that they have some catch up to do , the tech business have been on the rise in my country and on this sector I believe that If one is properly established then there is a very low chance of getting a loss in this type business and since technology doesn't die but rather it is an ongoing thing, always getting better and better  hence I still predict that the sector will never fail in the future if entrepreneurs are always looking out for the newest and latest technology
22/07/22, 17:53 - Unknown: Greetings Proud Edoofian ✨
I hope that you are doing well

As August Intake is right at our doorsteps, So due to this many of our Edoofians will be arriving here in India to kick start their dream journey.?

I feel that it is my duty to make sure that the university has prepared well for their onboarding process.

This is why I would be visiting the universities Today in order to do a personal check up.
Since, This process would take up lots of time that is why we won't be able to connect Today.
However, I am sure that in my absence, You will make sure that you follow the below given things:

1. Make sure to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual at 9 AM Tomorrow.
2. Do submit the Wednesday Lesson before the deadline.
22/07/22, 17:53 - Unknown: I will evaluate your responses once I get back

25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

25/07/22, 18:47 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

This week, we discovered that people who are successful don't hold the world responsible for their failures. They accept accountability for their own choices and results. To develop this mindset of taking responsibility for everything and avoiding the blame game takes time and focus. As your Saturday Assignment your are required to write a short write up, on the growth mindset of successful people and how will you make sure you develop the same mindset. The word limit for this assignment is 150-200 words. 

Kindly make sure you follow the word limit strictly, any responses less than the minimum word limit will not be marked. 
You are required to submit the same by Tuesday 3 PM  on the dedicated EWYL line. 

Happy learning !
