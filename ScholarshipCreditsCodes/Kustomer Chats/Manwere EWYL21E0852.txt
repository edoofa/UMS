13/07/22, 22:01 - Saloni Rastogi: WEEKEND ACTIVITY
 \u2028\u2028You must have learned how critical it is to take advantage of every opportunity. In our Wednesday Wisdom this week, we discussed a profitable business- Skooqs. Do you know that Skooqs was developed in just five days!! Thanks to Oluwadamilola Soyombo's (Founder of Skooqs), diligence and use of the opportunity. The use of the opportunity at the right time with the right skills is currently creating a significant impact on the African entrepreneurial ecosystem.  And well some of you, because of your consistency, diligence, willingness to show up for your sessions, and performance in your weekly activities have gotten this opportunity to work on a project with Skooqs. 

You are probably aware of the possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. This week, I want you to think of a few skills or practices that a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits. 
Please list the skills that are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring in a lot of learning.
13/07/22, 22:04 - Manwere EWYL21E0852: Noted ma'am
13/07/22, 22:04 - Manwere EWYL21E0852: By the end of day I will submit
13/07/22, 22:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Please Manwere complete the activity and do share your response as soon as you do.
13/07/22, 23:50 - Manwere EWYL21E0852: Skills or practices that a student must uphold in order to be given a chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credit are

Risk taker
Hardworking  
Innovative 
Consistent 
Willingness
Punctual
Diligent
Persistent
14/07/22, 01:44 - Saloni Rastogi: I am really glad to hear your understanding of the activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY* . They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.

15/07/22, 22:26 - Manwere EWYL21E0852: Proudly edoofian
15/07/22, 22:35 - Saloni Rastogi: I really appreciate your efforts Manwere but let me correct you a bit here. Our ritual is not 'proudly Edoofian' but it is 'I am a proud edoofian'. I hope to see your amazing zeal with this corrected saying of our ritual.
15/07/22, 22:36 - Manwere EWYL21E0852: Noted ma'am ???
15/07/22, 22:43 - Manwere EWYL21E0852: I am a proud edoofian
15/07/22, 22:44 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
16/07/22, 01:21 - Saloni Rastogi: That's amazing Manwere, well appreciated.
16/07/22, 01:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Now I want you to share your response on the Wednesday wisdom, I am so excited to discuss your response with you.
16/07/22, 05:28 - Manwere EWYL21E0852: Patrick matsope the son of Augustine Matsope  who used to sell liquor to some miners when his son  used to accompany him to sell the liquor  after that he aquired a degree in bachelor of arts he was not only determined and had passion to become successful after being lawyer  he started his own business of mining and business law which only started having full knowledge and now he have built many mines in the world employing many people and  improving standard of living of people 
This shows he was determined , persistent
16/07/22, 05:32 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your response Manwere and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a WAY. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. We can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.
16/07/22, 05:33 - Manwere EWYL21E0852: Thank you ma'am
16/07/22, 19:37 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Manwere!

20/07/22, 00:49 - Manwere EWYL21E0852: Fast growing industry in my country

 Industries specializes in different things .in my country the fast growing industry is industry of mines which making the country to bring in foreign currency not only that it is creating employment for the community and improving standard of living of people 

Mining has increased the country's Gross domestic product  
Furthermore looking at the internal and external factors that affect this business which is regarded as the swot analysis  as it is  defined as strength weakness which are internal factors also opportunities and threats which are external factors 

Mining sector should be able to analyze it's the swot analysis 
Strength and weakness are within the mining sector  whilst opportunities and threats are outside the business
Business strength is good relationship with the customers good management team quality products up to date technology ando motivated workforce
Weakness include poor management team demotivated workforce so many  cash flow problems and limited product range 

In addition   opportunities include new markets  economic recovery increase in employment low interest rates 
Threats may include inflation fall in demand high interest rates decrease and employment
20/07/22, 01:01 - Manwere EWYL21E0852: I have come for my sessions
20/07/22, 01:01 - Manwere EWYL21E0852: Am Proudly edoofian
20/07/22, 01:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Manwere!
I would like to inform you again that our daily ritual is not 'proudly edoofian' rather it is 'I am a proud Edoofian'. Please remember that.
20/07/22, 01:50 - Saloni Rastogi: What I read in your response, made me inquisitive to do more research on the mining industry in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe’s mining sector is highly diversified, with close to 40 different minerals.  The predominant minerals include platinum, chrome, gold, coal, and diamonds.  The country boasts the second-largest platinum deposit and high-grade chromium ores in the world, with approximately 2.8 billion tons of platinum group metals and 10 billion tons of chromium ore.  The sector accounts for about 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) and the minister of mines claims the sector has the potential to generate US$12 billion annually by 2023 if the government addresses challenges such as persistent power shortages, and foreign currency shortages, and policy uncertainties.
20/07/22, 01:51 - Saloni Rastogi: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader. 
Also Manwere, along with the SWOT analysis of a company, I would appreciate it if you also share a SWOT analysis of yourself. I want to see how much more you have learned beyond this activity.
20/07/22, 19:53 - Manwere EWYL21E0852: Noted ma'am
25/07/22, 03:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

26/07/22, 21:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

Yesterday I had an amazing day. I went to the airport to receive all my proud Edoofians and I had tears in my eyes seeing their happiness and enthusiasm. I want you to look at it and share your thoughts with me.
26/07/22, 21:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, we can have our session:
''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''

The weekend activity clearly talked about what are the growing mindsets of successful people. 
I would really appreciate it if you share your understanding with me on the same and what you think can take you to the top.
27/07/22, 00:31 - Manwere EWYL21E0852: Wow a motivation to me

27/07/22, 05:36 - Saloni Rastogi: These smiling faces mean so much to us, can't even express.
27/07/22, 05:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Also Manwere, I have informed you a few times before and I would spare some time to inform you again that our daily ritual is not 'proudly edoofian'. It is *' I am a proud edoofian'.*
Please stick to it.
27/07/22, 05:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, we have to discuss our weekend activity also, please share your understanding on the same with me.

29/07/22, 06:43 - Saloni Rastogi: We are back with our Wednesday lesson.

I realised as soon as I started reading this lesson that most of my students needed to learn and grasp this. One person succeeding and one failing depends solely on how effectively they manage their time. Try to comprehend and apply the measures discussed in the lesson to your everyday life. I'll be here to help you, so that you can focus on learning how to manage your time effectively. In our following session, please explain in detail what you learned from the lesson.

Happy learning !

07/08/22, 00:14 - Manwere EWYL21E0852: I missed my session yesterday I have come for it
07/08/22, 19:05 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Manwere!
How's your day going?
07/08/22, 19:05 - Saloni Rastogi: Reading your response Manwere filled me with so much fire, passion, and motivation. It got reminded me of one quote:
“If you want to be happy the whole life, tie it to a goal, not people or objects.”

This was the quotation given by Alert Einstein and the quote which gives the definition of a goal.
Through this lesson, my main motive was to teach you that sacrifices are required to achieve the main target, and achievement of those important aims is necessary.
Those aims are:
1. Analysis of my strength and weaknesses – because this analysis will let me know that how to work on both to make my strength more powerful and convert my weakness into my strength.
2. To be a good person and love yourself – To get positive vibes one should work on herself\/himself because “when you see yourself clearly, with eyes full of love and acceptance, you hold space for others to meet you at your highest self “(by Karly Ryan).
3. Never regret any past decision – “Every bad decision gives you a lesson and this makes one’s vision more clear towards the achievement of its goal” as it is said by a great personality that takes responsibility and initiative for yourself stop blaming your circumstances for what you can change.
4. Always give 100% – there is a frame on my living room wall, of Swami Vivekananda that always gives me motivation the quotation written in it says “Arise, awake, and do not stop until the goal is reached”.
07/08/22, 19:05 - Saloni Rastogi: I would like to share something about my goals.
My goals also consist of making my parents proud of their daughter, a daughter that will give them a more comfortable life, one that is not filled with such pain. Indeed, I cannot deny that truly I am not experienced as much as some people, but at least for me, every milestone in my life is an emblem of my growth. When I can complete something new successfully or learn something from my failure instead of complaining, I think I have grown up.
07/08/22, 19:06 - Saloni Rastogi: I am so happy to see you following the daily ritual so consistently and dedicatedly.

07/08/22, 20:27 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
11/08/22, 22:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
