The journey to your educational pinnacle begins here
22/08/23, 12:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Leroy!
How are you?
22/08/23, 12:01 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
22/08/23, 12:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù
22/08/23, 12:01 - Saloni Rastogi: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
22/08/23, 12:02 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *12:00-01:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
22/08/23, 12:02 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
22/08/23, 12:12 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: Yes ma'am l am ready.
22/08/23, 12:15 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know which project will you choose to do for the coming weeks?
22/08/23, 14:54 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: The weekend projects will do ma'am.
22/08/23, 15:48 - Saloni Rastogi: .
22/08/23, 15:48 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know out fo these three projects, which one will you want to do?
22/08/23, 16:11 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: Project 2 ma'am.
22/08/23, 16:30 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share what is your understanding of it and how do you wish to work on it?
22/08/23, 16:46 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: It is about reaching out to any African student who has recently finished High School or one who has finished it 6 months ago and have the zeal to study abroad for their higher education. The reason being to grant them the same chance I am having with Edoofa Scholarship Program.In this light l plan to travel to schools and use media platforms like whatsapp and Facebook to reach out to students.
22/08/23, 16:56 - Saloni Rastogi: That's great!
So I believe you have formed a WhatsApp group for the same.

May I know how many unique people you reach out every day and share them about your WhatsApp group?
22/08/23, 16:58 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: So far my progress is slow due to pressure I'm having but l try to jus send my group link in different groups here n there n ask those interested to come to my inbox. That is how l am doing it for now. I plan to change gears after this pressure has eased.
22/08/23, 17:00 - Saloni Rastogi: But how many unique students do you reach out to?
22/08/23, 17:04 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: There are just 4 l talk to everyday about the same. Three I have sent u their forms and the other l am sure it will come soon.
22/08/23, 17:05 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: Oooh sorry about my WhatsApp group l do not reach specific number of people but it will be just groups of different students ranging from 100 and above
22/08/23, 17:05 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: In those education groups
23/08/23, 23:05 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: I am a proud Edoofian.

25/08/23, 15:35 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Leroy Chizinga and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Leroy EWYL22E0990.
25/08/23, 15:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Leroy!
How are you?

Time management is a crucial skill that empowers individuals to make the most of their precious hours. It involves setting priorities, creating schedules, and staying organized to achieve goals efficiently. Effective time management not only enhances productivity but also helps reduce stress by providing a structured approach to daily tasks. Ultimately, it allows for a better work-life balance, enabling individuals to enjoy both their professional and personal lives more fully. 

So this amazing Wednesday lesson was on Time Management.
Let's hear out what you have to say for it followed by projects update.
25/08/23, 15:57 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: I learnt that time management is a very crucial skill to everyone who wishes to be successful in life. It lessens stress but keeps you focused in accomplishing your goals as planned without wasting your time on less important things. Though one cannot just woke up mastering this skill but rather it is learned and one can master it with time.
25/08/23, 16:01 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: About my projects l have reached out to one student yesterday telling her about the scholarship program. I sent her a voice note of 30 minutes in length so l am still waiting to hear from her. One of the students from those forwarded offline application forms reached out to me saying that he has gone through the Edoofa Scholarship Interview. That is all l have now.
25/08/23, 16:05 - Saloni Rastogi: Leroy, it's fantastic to see your dedication to time management and your commitment to helping students access scholarship opportunities. Your understanding of the importance of this skill in achieving success is truly commendable. By reaching out to students and sharing information about the scholarship program, you're not only reducing their stress but also empowering them to focus on their educational goals. Your patience in waiting for a response and your willingness to engage with students through a 30-minute voice note demonstrate your genuine dedication. Moreover, hearing that one of the students you assisted has progressed to the interview stage is a testament to your effectiveness. Keep up the excellent work, Leroy, as your efforts are making a meaningful difference in these students' lives. Your perseverance and commitment to helping others are truly inspiring.
25/08/23, 16:06 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: Thank you ma'am, I am honored.
25/08/23, 16:33 - Saloni Rastogi: So Leroy, you last talked about connecting with 100 students in unique groups, may I know in which group do you connect with?
25/08/23, 16:35 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: Okay there l referred to student study groups which are not mine but l would just forward my group link the one you know to let anyone who would be interested to join and contact me.
25/08/23, 16:37 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: How can I let you know ma'am ? Do l need to take screenshots or tell you the names of the groups or?
25/08/23, 16:49 - Saloni Rastogi: No no Leroy, I trust you on that.

I just want to see that you have reached out to different groups through you only, no need to have proof.
25/08/23, 16:50 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know what messages do you share in the group?
25/08/23, 16:55 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: Let me look at the recent message l used.
25/08/23, 16:56 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: Have you ever dreamed of studying for higher education abroad?
You know somewhere where the quality of degrees you get cannot be compared with the ones you can get locally.
Here is the deal, have you ever heard of something called EDOOFA?
Edoofa is a scholarship program that is mainly aimed at providing education for African students under scholarship in India. It gives a 50 to 75 percent scholarship to deserving students. So you might be asking about what makes a student deserving?
First of all Edoofa is not a charity program but rather an enterprise, this means you will have to pay some money. What it does is to provide you with a chance to study in India under the best institutions there. But there are things that deems one deserving, that is you have to go under interview sessions with the Edoofa Scholarship board. After you qualify they get you on the counseling session where you will be doing everyday. These sessions help to make you understand more about Edoofa as you will be actually talking with the Indians, to be specific the Edoofa Scholarship Program counselors. Some days you will have video calls with them, whilst being with your parents. Then there comes a time when you will be asked to pay for Edoofa Scholarship seat reservation, because just come to think of how many students like you apply per day, this means the seats will be given to anyone who pays, thus, they will not have any lose if you choose not go on with the registration. Edoofa aims to provide affordable education, employability after finishing the course... Those who may be interested to go for their higher education in India under a 50 to 100 percent scholarship with the the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you may kindly join that group for further information and dms are okay too for any kind of question regarding this scholarship program.
25/08/23, 16:57 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: This the last one l send and there is an error on the scholarship funding it should be to 100 percent
25/08/23, 16:58 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: Have you ever dreamed of studying for higher education abroad?

25/08/23, 16:58 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: This is the other one l finished explaining on audios.
25/08/23, 19:21 - Saloni Rastogi: This is great, the information is really well!
25/08/23, 19:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Edoofians! üåü
Get ready for an awesome week ahead! üöÄ This Saturday, you have an exciting task: create your own weekly timetable.
üìÖ Time is precious, and using it wisely can enhance your academic journey. Your timetable will be your roadmap, helping you balance studies, personal commitments, and relaxation.
üéÆüå¥ Remember, this isn't just about schedules; it's about harmonizing academics and personal time, finding moments to unwind and conquer projects. üé®
Mix hard work and chill sessions for a balanced week. ‚è≥‚ö°Ô∏è Use emojis to infuse your unique energy into the timetable! ‚è∞üéâ
Submit your timetables before our next session. We're excited to see your fantastic schedules!

25/08/23, 19:22 - Saloni Rastogi: doc 25/08
25/08/23, 19:26 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: Okay ma'am.
28/08/23, 11:32 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: I am a proud Edoofian.
28/08/23, 11:32 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

It was launched on 14 july, 2023, making India the first country to successfully land a spacecraft near the lunar south pole.
01/09/23, 16:10 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: I do Art (letter designing) to be specific and music l think that is where l  am talented, so far that is what l know.
01/09/23, 16:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Leroy, it's truly inspiring to hear about your talents in art, especially letter design, and your passion for music. These are gifts that not only make you unique but also hold the power to touch hearts and inspire others. Your artistic abilities have the potential to create beauty and emotion, while your musical talent can bring joy and harmony into the world.
01/09/23, 16:28 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: Yes that is very true ma'am.
01/09/23, 16:32 - Saloni Rastogi: So Leroy, may I know what progress have you made on projects lately?
01/09/23, 16:42 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: I've reached out to a few students about 6 more but they have been giving excuses to fill the offline forms on the basis of the term commencing on Monday
01/09/23, 16:43 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: Among those who filled the forms l gave you, there is only one whom the Edoofa has reached to.
01/09/23, 16:44 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: Among these 6  is  the girl l sent the 30 minutes audio but she finally gave an excuse too about school.
01/09/23, 16:50 - Saloni Rastogi: 1. May I know how many members are there in your Edoofa community building group?

2. How do you reach out to unique students, like increasing the number of participants?

3. How do you keep them engaged?
01/09/23, 16:51 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share the responses to these question, I would assist you accordingly to the questions and concern shared by you as well.
01/09/23, 17:01 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: 1. There are 20 members

2. I just send links into A level student study groups and whoever joins usually comes to my inbox for more information about the scholarship program.

3. I sometimes send any information such as pictures, videos and other media about Edoofians to keep them motivated and influenced to be part of the Edoofa family. This happens in the group mostly and a few in their inboxes.
01/09/23, 18:25 - Saloni Rastogi: I will end the session by saying:

Hidden talents are like the sparkling gems waiting to be discovered in the depths of our souls. They are the beautiful secrets that each of us carries, often concealed by the noise of everyday life. What makes them truly magnificent is the element of surprise they bring when they finally emerge. These talents are the unexpected strokes of genius, the melodies of the heart, and the sparks of creativity that add unique colors to the canvas of our lives. Having a hidden talent is like possessing a precious treasure chest of abilities that can enrich our existence and connect us with our true selves. It's a reminder of the limitless potential that resides within each individual, waiting for the right moment to dazzle the world.
01/09/23, 18:31 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: But how do you actually come to know about your hidden talents?
02/09/23, 11:30 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: I am a proud Edoofian.
02/09/23, 11:30 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

 Can you identify this majestic natural wonder in Zimbabwe?

02/09/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well and thriving in your academic journey. Today, we want to encourage you to step out of your comfort zone and share your hidden talents.

We believe that each one of you possesses a hidden gem within, waiting to be discovered. Your talents are not just hobbies; they are an integral part of who you are. They make you unique and add vibrancy to our academic community.

Why a video, you ask? Well, videos are a powerful medium to convey emotions and connect with others. They allow you to express yourself fully, capturing the essence of your talent.

16/09/23, 19:20 - Leroy EWYL22E0990: The Most Effective Retention Strategy that l have been using after being taught by my teachers this year is spaced repetition. That is doing small frequent reviews of all of your material over a long period of time right to test day.

This have been so helpful and improving my ability to retain information over time. It‚Äôs easier, way less stressful, and assures that you‚Äôll uncover any difficulties well before the exam.

Spaced repetition is frequently done with flash card apps that present the ones you get wrong more often than the ones you get right. You can do something similar on your own.

When you took notes and read your textbook, you wrote test questions. You‚Äôll be using those to do frequent reviews.

04/11/23, 13:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

As part of your Saturday Activity, I encourage each one of you to dedicate some time to journaling for just one day. Let your thoughts flow freely onto the pages, expressing your feelings, ideas, and observations. Take this opportunity to delve deep within yourself and discover what truly matters to you. Your journal can be a canvas for your dreams, fears, aspirations, and daily experiences. When sharing your journal, feel free to discuss your insights, challenges, and any personal growth you may have experienced through the process.

I believe that this activity will not only enhance your writing skills but also nurture your emotional intelligence and self-awareness. I look forward to reading and discussing your journal entries during our upcoming session. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Happy journaling!
