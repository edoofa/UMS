How are you today?
26/09/23, 13:25 - Kudzaishe EWYL23E0572: I'm. Well thank you
26/09/23, 13:30 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.
26/09/23, 13:33 - Kudzaishe EWYL23E0572: Noted
26/09/23, 13:38 - Ananya: Now, I believe that we should initiate something that aligns with your interests. So, may I ask which project is your favorite project?
26/09/23, 13:42 - Kudzaishe EWYL23E0572: The community building project
26/09/23, 13:42 - Ananya: That's amazing! So may I ask what is your progress in that? Do you have any idea for working on this project?
26/09/23, 13:44 - Kudzaishe EWYL23E0572: I'm trying to connect with the school headmaster of some schools

26/09/23, 13:59 - Ananya: Another thing you can do is:

Go to Facebook and search for "Student Communities in Zimbabwe"
Join a relevant group from the appeared results.
Share information about Edoofa and include the WhatsApp group link.
Interested individuals can join the group and connect with you.
Communicate with them and provide further details about Edoofa.

As we all know, effective time management is essential for achieving your academic goals, especially when the pressure mounts during exam periods. In today's lesson, we will delve into the importance of time management, explore strategies to make the most of your study time, and discuss techniques to strike a balance between your coursework/EWYL commitments and exam preparation.

Together, we will equip ourselves with valuable skills to navigate the demands of exam season successfully.
Best wishes

04/10/23, 13:58 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofians,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning

06/10/23, 14:01 - Kudzaishe EWYL23E0572: N
06/10/23, 14:12 - Ananya: Well, your school is already connected with us. You know, one of my students' friends is studying in a different school. She has actually joined their WhatsApp class groups and is now communicating with them. Not only that, since she is connected with students from various schools, she is also obtaining the contact information of school administrators. This way, she is working on two separate projects simultaneously.

Don't you think it is an amazing idea?
06/10/23, 14:14 - Kudzaishe EWYL23E0572: Yes I do
06/10/23, 14:15 - Ananya: So do you have any friends from different schools?

06/10/23, 14:21 - Kudzaishe EWYL23E0572: Yes I managed to read it
06/10/23, 14:22 - Ananya: Great! So what did you learn from it?
06/10/23, 14:27 - Kudzaishe EWYL23E0572: I leant that at most you should not be stingy with knowledge you should be able to share the infor information you have with others and also gain some advice from other. Also my contribution to the community does benefit me only but eveeryone. Also by being part of something great can help you achieve your goals
06/10/23, 14:28 - Ananya: I completely agree with your statement! Belongingness indeed plays a crucial role in achieving success, providing motivation, support, knowledge, networking opportunities, accountability, emotional well-being, and the recognition of being part of something bigger than oneself. It can be a driving force behind the pursuit of long-lasting goals. Well said!
06/10/23, 14:33 - Kudzaishe EWYL23E0572: Thank you
