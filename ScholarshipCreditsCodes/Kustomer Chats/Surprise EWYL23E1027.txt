The commitment to excellence exhibited by both Yeukai and Edoofa symbolizes the ethos of continuous improvement and dedication to empowering the next generation of leaders.
05/01/24, 13:12 - Ananya: Good morning, Suprise!

Every day is a new beginning, take a deep breath and start afresh. On this note, let us begin our session and make a change together! ‚òÄÔ∏èüåº
05/01/24, 13:13 - Surprise EWYL23E1027: Yes ma'am
05/01/24, 13:18 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
05/01/24, 13:20 - Surprise EWYL23E1027: Noted
05/01/24, 13:23 - Ananya: Well, I believe that we should begin with something that aligns with your interests. So would you like to share which one is your favorite project? The community building or the school reform?
05/01/24, 13:24 - Surprise EWYL23E1027: The community building is my favorite üòÅ
05/01/24, 13:25 - Ananya: Well, that's great! So, would you like to share your progress with me?
05/01/24, 13:30 - Surprise EWYL23E1027: So far 5 people have requested for the offline application form and I have given them, two of them have correctly filled out the form and I have already submitted them. One filled the form incorrectly so I told him how to correct the mistake. And two haven't finished filling out the form yet.
05/01/24, 13:38 - Ananya: Alright, Suprise! I am happy with your progress. Now I want to know how you search for the students in your community building project.
05/01/24, 13:42 - Surprise EWYL23E1027: I sent the link to my group to all the groups to which I was a member and told them what I was going to be talking about in that group
I also posted the same on my WhatsApp status and asked the viewers to help by post the same on their statuses too. I also send the link and description to all my relatives and asked them to share with their friends and now I'm about to post on my Instagram and Facebook accounts too.
05/01/24, 13:49 - Ananya: Alright, that's great! I have a few more ideas, would you like to know them?
05/01/24, 13:51 - Surprise EWYL23E1027: Yes please üòä
05/01/24, 13:58 - Ananya: *Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
05/01/24, 14:04 - Surprise EWYL23E1027: Thank you so much
05/01/24, 14:14 - Ananya: So, surprise! As a mentor, I want to ensure that you earn credits and utilize this opportunity to finance your own education. To achieve this, I usually set a target for my students from the start. This helps me understand their potential and the skills required for the future. So, are you ready for your first target?
05/01/24, 14:21 - Surprise EWYL23E1027: Ready ma'am
05/01/24, 14:23 - Ananya: Great! Your first target is to connect with 4 students this week and submit their offline application forms with me. Alright?
05/01/24, 14:29 - Surprise EWYL23E1027: Ok so this means I have only two days, including today
05/01/24, 14:30 - Ananya: No, you can do this by Monday, just before your next session.
05/01/24, 14:30 - Surprise EWYL23E1027: Great
05/01/24, 14:30 - Ananya: Now, as you wrap up today's endeavors, remember: 'Believe you can and you're halfway there.' - Theodore Roosevelt. Your efforts today are the foundation for your success tomorrow. Keep pushing forward with confidence and determination. üí™

08/01/24, 00:09 - Ananya: I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special ‚Äì our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! üöÄ

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right ‚Äì they will be there live, right in front of us!

12/01/24, 13:13 - Ananya: Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed with a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?
