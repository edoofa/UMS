14/07/22, 22:21 - Elizabeth EWYL21E0664: I was indeed inspired by the story of Patrice Tilhopane Motsepe who was born with no money but he had goals. A hardworker , passion , believed in himself and never gave up. He got exposure to business by helping his father in a Spaza shop where her would sell liquor to miners before they would go to work. His story to become a billionaire has taught me many things by starting small he had to learn business from the start , this taught me to always be aware of surroundings so as to not let great opportunities pass by when all you need is to learn . It also taught me that one can start small and and up being successful all that is needed is to be hardworking, believing in yourself , passion and never giving up . When there is an opportunity one should grab it and use it in the right way . Therefore this can lead a person to success.
14/07/22, 22:58 - Unknown: \"Success is Not Final, Failure is Not Fatal: it is the Courage to Continue that Counts\"- Winston Churchill

19/07/22, 16:57 - Elizabeth EWYL21E0664: *Saturday activity

In Zimbabwe they are many industries and businesses that are growing since the economy is still growing but in my own observation the food court business is growing because no matter how bad the economy may become people tend to buy take away food everyday especially in the CBD . Most of the owners have made profits and ended up owning a restaurant for example my aunt  Theresa Choto had a food court somewhere in town and now she owns a restaurant. We all know how things were when she started but she has inspired me a lot indicating that one can do it no matter what . In December last year I worked at her restaurant for a couple of days as a waitress and that gave me the exposure to the business and experience that will aid me in the near future. Therefore  thats why I have always thought of having a restaurant of my own even if I start small i will get there.

19/07/22, 23:26 - Unknown: Let me first help you understand what SWOT Analysis is.

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment.This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organisations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
19/07/22, 23:57 - Elizabeth EWYL21E0664: Ok understood
20/07/22, 00:00 - Unknown: As seen above, SWOT is an acronym of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. However, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym:

1 Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
2 Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
3 Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
4 Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by.
20/07/22, 00:00 - Elizabeth EWYL21E0664: Ok understood
20/07/22, 00:11 - Unknown: You know Elizabeth, why SWOT Analysis is important? It can help you to challenge risky assumptions and to uncover dangerous blindspots about your organization's performance. If you use it carefully and collaboratively, it can deliver new insights on where your business currently is, and help you to develop exactly the right strategy for any situation.
20/07/22, 00:11 - Unknown: For example, you may be well aware of some of your organization's strengths, but until you record them alongside weaknesses and threats you might not realize how unreliable those strengths actually are.

Equally, you likely have reasonable concerns about some of your business weaknesses but, by going through the analysis systematically, you could find an opportunity, previously overlooked, that could more than compensate.

21/07/22, 21:04 - Unknown: Did you work on the Wednesday wisdom Elizabeth? What are your takeaways from it?
21/07/22, 21:45 - Elizabeth EWYL21E0664: ? Wednesday wisdom lesson

? The lesson today was quite a different one and it taught me a lot . It helped me to understand that if you want to be successful you should learn to take responsibilities , understand ups and downs when they come instead of blaming others when something happens. One should learn to always stay positive . Also a person should be careful of what he or she says to others because some words may not be acceptable to others . I understood that success does not magically happen that it needs ones great efforts and hard work to get it so one should always stay focused and remain determined. 
?
21/07/22, 22:03 - Unknown: Good to read your response on this lesson Elizabeth! I am glad that you were able to understand the crux of that which is that successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it.
