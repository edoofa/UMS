03/03/23, 20:46 - Natalie EWYL22E0759: In today's lesson I understood that  Neyflorist is a South Largest online gifting company found by Ryan Bacher and his brother Lawrence. This is a flower delivery service in Johannesburg . This was a traditional brick and mortar florist until they soon realized the potential of internet as a platform for online shopping.
So with this information it helps me to use internet for e-commerce businesses using the online models. Through internet service it helps me to do digital marketing on social media and email marketing to get new customers and build brand awareness

Ready for today’s Wednesday Wisdom?

Have you ever wondered what the one governing principle that governs all businesses might be? What is the name of the one value that every company considers to be crucial? Have you ever heard of something called the North Star Metric?

North Star Metric is a key business metric that reflects the core value a product delivers to its customers. It's a single, actionable metric that aligns all efforts towards achieving long-term growth. Let us learn about in greater detail, read the lesson carefully and we will connect in our upcoming scheduled session. 

Till then Happy learning!
12/03/23, 18:24 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well

The feedback we have received from some of you on this week’s Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.
As part of this week’s Saturday Activity, you are required to share your written submission on : 
What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?
There is no word limit, so feel free to express your understanding in detail. The second answer requires some mental work, so sit with yourself, introspect, and share your honest answer with your mentor. 
Let this activity play an important role in your personal goal setting. We will connect soon in our upcoming session. 
Till then, happy learning and happy growing!

After that I will create a LinkedIn account and connect with decision makers of those companies so that they will be able to set up a meeting with you

The second project was on visiting higher secondary Schools and meet the principals of those schools and inform them about the Edoofa program. I should make a list of all the higher secondary in my local area starting with my own school  . I will tell them why I joined the Edoofa program at first and tell them how I planned my future and share the program details with them. After that I will tell them that there will be an online meeting with Edoofa. Lastly I will share the contact details of the principal with you

25/04/23, 14:49 - Natalie EWYL22E0759: Sorry ma'am what exactly am I supposed to do
Should I summarize what has been written and what I understood on the PDF
25/04/23, 14:54 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, let me explain. You have to go through the lesson and tell me to which principle you as a person relate the most and why.
25/04/23, 14:55 - Natalie EWYL22E0759: Alright thank you
25/04/23, 14:59 - Jasmine Kaur: I hope everything is clear now
25/04/23, 15:01 - Natalie EWYL22E0759: Yes ma'am
25/04/23, 15:07 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, All the best!
25/04/23, 15:22 - Natalie EWYL22E0759: The principle that I can relate is Faith , because I always have positive thoughts in my mind and it makes me believe that I can do it as long I have God by my side . Faith makes me feel like I have started to succeed in my life and without it I don't think I was able to even apply for the Edoofa scholarship. Faith makes me who I am today and will always reminds me what I am capable of doing in order to achieve my goals .
25/04/23, 15:24 - Jasmine Kaur: It's wonderful to hear that you hold faith in high regard and that it has helped you to achieve your goals, including applying for the Edoofa scholarship. Believing in oneself and having faith in a higher power can provide a sense of inner strength and motivation, and can help individuals to persevere through difficult times. It's great to see that you have a positive outlook and a strong sense of determination. Keep up the good work!
25/04/23, 15:25 - Natalie EWYL22E0759: Thank you so much ma'am
25/04/23, 15:28 - Jasmine Kaur: Now, I would start by sending you the Saturday Activity. You can take today's day and submit it to me by the end of today. Will that be okay?

Here is your Saturday Activity, . You can take today's day and submit it to me by the end of today.
In his book "Think and Grow Rich," Napoleon Hill outlines 13 principles for achieving success and wealth. For this assignment, focus on the first 6 principles: Desire, Faith, Autosuggestion, Specialized Knowledge, Imagination, and Organized Planning.
Explain what each of these principles means and how it can help      someone achieve success and wealth.
Provide specific examples of how each principle has been applied in      real life, either by successful individuals you know of or by yourself.
Discuss any challenges or limitations you see in applying these      principles and how they can be overcome.
In your submission, demonstrate a clear understanding of each principle and its relevance to success and wealth. Use specific examples and evidence to support your points. Your submission should be well-written and well-organized, with proper citations and references where necessary. Your submission should be between 500-700 words in length.
25/04/23, 15:31 - Natalie EWYL22E0759: Its okay ma'am I will submit it today
25/04/23, 15:33 - Jasmine Kaur: Secondly, I would like to share your newsletter.
25/04/23, 15:49 - Jasmine Kaur: Are we still connected dear?
25/04/23, 19:52 - Natalie EWYL22E0759: Alright
26/04/23, 00:54 - Natalie EWYL22E0759: I am going to share  what I  read from Think and Grow Rich book which was written by Napoleon Hill . The first principle is the desire. This refers to the starting point of an achievement meaning that you can not achieve a goal without the desire to achieve it. For a person to be successful one should be able to define a goal and pour their energy, power and effort in order to achieve that goal. For example Christiano Ronaldo had the desire to become rich through playing football until he became the best football player in the world. His desires gave him the strength then he pour his energy, power , effort and worked so hard until he earn that goal. 
Here is some steps that were highlighted in Hill's book that can help someone to achieve their goals these are,  decide how much  money you wish to make to the dollar for example when you want to start a business you should be able to know the amount of money that you have and how much it will give you in return . Secondly one should be able to determine what you are willing to give to receive this amount of money meaning that one  should know the money that is being invested if it will be refunded and lastly one should create a plan on how to achieve that goal and begin at once whether you feel ready or not . However being able to visualize yourself as rich may be challenging at first because of negative thoughts and lack of self confidence you have. Therefore you should be money conscious so that you will become a successful person through seeing yourself in possession of great wealth before you attain it.
The second principle is Faith. This means that one should have complete confidence in his or her goals with a strong belief in a supernatural power that control your destiny. Having faith emphasis that a person should be positive minded in order to achieve the set objectives as it is a starting point of all success. For example when I applied for the Edoofa scholarship I had faith that I am going to pass my A level and get a scholarship from Edoofa for my further studies. It made me who I am today because I was elected as one of the students who got that's scholarship This also reminds me what I am capable of doing in order to earn my objectives. However i also face some challenges that gave me negative consequences that results in believing that I am unweathy , doomed and thinking that I am a failure . But I overcomed it because I was motivated that I can do it through Christ.

The third principle is on auto suggestion which is the same as self suggestion. Therefore it is the medium for influencing the subconscious mind. This helps a  person who have subconscious minded to act upon thoughts that are felt and find a quiet place that he or she can not be Disturbed . Hill states that, the he or she should  repeat aloud the  written statement and start imaginating  having money.
The fourth principle is specialized knowledge that is personal experiences and observation. A person should become more focused on an area of activity. It's either you should use general or specialized knowledge through critical thinking. For example Sadio Mane had specialized his knowledge and start selling water in Senegal until he becames a successful man. This helps him because he developed from a special business he was doing up until he achieve a certain goal .Having specialized knowledge on an area in which you attend to make your fortune hells you to be successful. However it might take time but you have to be more patient until you  achieve your goals.

The fifth principle is imagination . This is the workshop of mind . As a human being who wants to be successful start imaginating yourself as a person who have already accomplished her goals . For example you can imagine yourself as a president like what the late President Gabriel Mugabe does while he was a child. He imagined himself as the president of Zimbabwe untill he become one . Through his synthetic imaginations you can reformulate existing concept, ideas and plans into new form. Imaginating only  does not create anything because it works with existing mental material. Creative imaginations is what springs forth from hunches and inspiration . This will help you to be successful because within it new ideas are formed meaning that it can only be reached when your conscious mind is being stimulated through desire . Another example is Coca-Cola company it started as a simple idea untill it becomes a multinational company. 
The last principle is organized planning. This means the crystalization of desire into action. In order to organize yourself on one person you should ally yourself with a master mind group that consists of people who will help you carry out your plan. However before assembling the group, be sure to ascertain, what it is you can offer each of the members in return for their work. This will help a person to meet with the group at least twice a week or more if possible until a solid plan had been created. Therefore one should maintain good relations between you and groups at all times.

I am sure the lesson will be full of learning and inspiration and you will surely learn many characteristics from our founders which will help you get to the top and be a well respected Leader!

Deadline - 18 May 2023
17/05/23, 20:27 - Jasmine Kaur: Lesson
17/05/23, 20:41 - Natalie EWYL22E0759: Thanks you ma'am should I share my understanding now
18/05/23, 18:35 - Natalie EWYL22E0759: Greetings Ms Jasmine. I would like to share what I learned on leadership.
I learned that a Servant
leadership is a leadership philosophy in which the goal of the leader is to serve and it is different from traditional leadership, where the leader's main focus is the thriving of their company or organization. The role of a servant leader is to share power and puts the needs of the employees first and helps people develop and perform as
highly as possible. Instead of the people working to serve the leader, the leader exists to serve the people.
For example Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh, the Edoofa
program's founders. They have always been passionate about making a difference in people's lives yet they come from a family of diplomats and bureaucrats. 
I also learned that they are 10 most important characteristics of leadership according to Larry C. Spears, former president of the Robert K. Greenleaf Center for Servant . 

From the first  charecteristic of leadership that is listening. I learned that I should serve people better when i make a deep commitment to listening intently to them and understanding
what they're saying. And also to improve my listening skills I should give people my full attention, take notice of their body language, avoid interrupting them before they've finished speaking, and give feedback on what they say.

The second characteristic is Empathy. I learned that as a
Servant leader I have to  strive to understand other people's intentions and perspectives. In order to be more empathic I  should put aside my
viewpoint temporarily, valuing others' perspectives, and approaching situations with an
open mind.

From the third characteristic of leadership that is Healing. I learned that this characteristic relates to the emotional health and "wholeness" of people and involves supporting them
both physically and mentally.But first I had to  make sure that my people have the knowledge, support, and resources they need to do their jobs
effectively, and that they have a healthy workplace. Then take steps to help them be happy and engaged in
their roles.

The fourth characteristic I learned is Self-Awareness . I learned that I have ability to look at myself, think deeply about my emotions and behavior, and consider
how they affect the people around me, and align with my values. This makes me become more self-aware by knowing my strengths and weaknesses, and asking for other people's
feedback on them.  This can make me manage mu emotions, so that I consider how my  actions and behavior
might affect others.

The fifth characteristic I learned is Persuasions .
As a servant leader I can use persuasion -- rather than their authority  to encourage people to take action. They also aim to build consensus in groups, so that everyone supports their decisions and believes in their vision.There are many tools and models that i can use to be more persuasive, without damaging relationships or
taking advantage of others. 

On the sixth characteristic which  is Conceptualization. I learned that 
this characteristic relates to my ability to "dream great dreams," so that I  look beyond day-to-day realities
to the bigger picture.
If you're a senior leader in your company, work through and develop a robust organizational strategy. 

Another characteristic is  Foresight. On this characteristic I learned that  I can predict what's likely to happen in the future by learning from past experiences,
 by identifying what's happening now, and understanding the consequences of my decisions.

Moreso Stewardship  the eighth characteristics of leadership. From this characteristic l learned that i should take responsibility for the actions and performance of my team and being
accountable for the role team members play in your organization.

Last but not least  Commitment to the Growth of People teaches me that as a Servant leader I should be more committed to the personal and professional development of everyone on their teams.

From the last characteristic that is community building which has to do with building a sense of community within my organization I learned that as a leader I have to develop  community with good , educated and successful people.

I understand that Success is not achieved in isolation but it requires a supportive network of individuals who inspire and uplift us. Surrounding ourselves with positive-minded people is crucial for personal growth, motivation, and ultimately, achieving our goals. This lesson delves into the significance
of associating with a growth-oriented community and highlights the exemplary Edoofa student community, which shines as a testament to the transformative power of positivity.
Our environment significantly impacts our thoughts, emotions, and actions. When we surround ourselves with negative-minded individuals, their pessimism can permeate our mindset and hinder our progress. On the other hand, being around positive minded people can uplift our spirits, fuel our motivation, and foster a growth-oriented mentality. Positive-minded
individuals exude optimism, resilience and a can-do attitude, which are vital for success.
Positive-minded people serve as a constant source of motivation and support on our journey toward success. They believe in our potential, provide encouragement, and inspire us to reach
higher goals. By witnessing their achievements and determination, we are motivated to push our boundaries and strive for excellence.Moreover, positive-minded individuals are always there to lend a helping hand, offering guidance, and advice, and sharing valuable experiences.
Surrounding ourselves with positive-minded people helps cultivate a growth mindset. A growth
mindset is the belief that our abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.
Positive-minded individuals embrace challenges as opportunities for growth, view failures as learning experiences, and celebrate the successes of others. They foster an environment that
encourages continuous learning, self-improvement, and resilience in the face of adversity.
A strong network of positive-minded individuals creates a supportive community that propels us
toward success. When we are surrounded by like-minded individuals who share our aspirations,
we gain access to diverse perspectives, knowledge, and resources. This network becomes a
valuable source of collaboration, mentorship, and inspiration. We can learn from each other's successes and challenges, and collectively accelerate our growth and achievements.
The Edoofa student community stands as an exceptional example of the power of positivity and a
growth-oriented mindset. Edoofa's inclusive and supportive ecosystem brings together students
from diverse backgrounds and cultures, fostering an environment that promotes personal and professional growth. The community provides a platform for students to connect, collaborate, and learn from each other. Through mentorship programs, workshops, and interactive sessions,
Edoofa empowers students to achieve their dreams.
Surrounding ourselves with positive-minded people is a crucial step on the road to success. The
influence of our surroundings, the motivation and support we receive, the nurturing of a growth mindset, and the creation of a supportive network all contribute to our personal and professional
development. The Edoofa student community shines brightly as a testament to the
transformative power of positive-minded individuals working together towards a common goal.
Let us recognize the significance of surrounding ourselves with positive-minded people and
actively seek out communities that foster growth, as this will undoubtedly pave the way for our
own success.

05/06/23, 20:46 - Jasmine Kaur:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, Let me share a small story with you!
 Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came. 
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.
The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell: 

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. 
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above

SATURDAY ACTIVITY
Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week’s Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better—together. It’s why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger—as successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!
