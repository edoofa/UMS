18/01/23, 17:36 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
18/01/23, 17:38 - Mitchell EWYL22E0620: Thank you

21/01/23, 23:11 - Mitchell EWYL22E0620: For today's session

The two questions I would ask myself would be :

1. Will I be satisfied with the career path that I have chosen, will I be content?

2.How do I reach my expectations in life without giving in to failure?

How was your weekend?

We gained knowledge on how to ask intelligent questions. I'd like you to share with us any two questions you'd like to ask yourself as part of your Saturday submission. The questions that you may have been hesitant to make, the questions that put you in a difficult situation, and the inquiries that will significantly impact your career and future.

In our discussion today on the EWYL Line, we will talk about:
1) the two questions you will raise
2) your progress on projects

01/02/23, 22:44 - Unknown: Greetings Mitchell!
How are you?
01/02/23, 22:56 - Unknown: Let me share the three projects with you again so that you can better decide soon because I really want that we start earning together.
01/02/23, 22:56 - Unknown: Can you please choose?
01/02/23, 22:57 - Unknown: I would really want that you start working on the African school reform project, the third one. What do you think?
01/02/23, 23:36 - Mitchell EWYL22E0620: Honestly this seems like it's out of my comfort zone but I will try
It can't hurt to try

02/02/23, 17:39 - Unknown: Good morning Mitchell!
How are you?
02/02/23, 17:39 - Unknown: Please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' for today.
02/02/23, 17:40 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
02/02/23, 17:40 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
02/02/23, 17:41 - Unknown: Also, let's start today by working on the school project in your scheduled session.
02/02/23, 18:38 - Mitchell EWYL22E0620: I am a proud Edoofian
02/02/23, 20:01 - Unknown: Greetings Mitchell!
How are you?
02/02/23, 20:03 - Unknown: We will discuss everything in our session today.
02/02/23, 21:41 - Mitchell EWYL22E0620: So the lessons was summarising on how building a good network is an essential skill
Having a good network allows to be up to date with the current information and skills
It also helps when finding employment because you will have people who can help you out in various fields that you're not aquinted with
02/02/23, 21:44 - Mitchell EWYL22E0620: I'd start by making a safe space for students to be able to communit without the fear of being criticised or judged
Set standards, values on goals so as to give the group a sense of direction and purpose
02/02/23, 22:57 - Unknown: I appreciate the understanding that you have shared with me on the lesson Mitchell ✨ .
02/02/23, 23:13 - Unknown: May I know how would it help you to build connections on LinkedIn?
03/02/23, 23:39 - Mitchell EWYL22E0620: I am a proud Edoofian
03/02/23, 23:41 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily
