23/07/22, 18:47 - Leslie EWYL22E0232: Well first of all in the morning after I wake up I feed the chickens then I start preparing for school. I will spend about 8 to 9 hours at school. After I return then I attend the EWYL session. I then organise the fowl run. Lastly I study.
23/07/22, 20:34 - Unknown: Great edoofian!
23/07/22, 20:34 - Unknown: Sat Activity:Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
This week, we discovered that people who are successful don't hold the world responsible for their failures. They accept accountability for their own choices and results. To develop this mindset of taking responsibility for everything and avoiding the blame game takes time and focus. As your Saturday Assignment your are required to write a short write up, on the growth mindset of successful people and how will you make sure you develop the same mindset. The word limit for this assignment is 150-200 words. Kindly make sure you follow the word limit strictly, any responses less than the minimum word limit will not be marked.
You are required to submit the same by Monday 10 AM  on the dedicated EWYL line.

Happy learning !
23/07/22, 20:34 - Unknown: Great, also I would like you to know , a successful day for me is when *I am able to contribute to the learnings of my students and inspire you.*

26/07/22, 18:39 - Unknown: Greetings edoofian,
Before we start any session today.

First of all, the newsletter for today is very interesting and impressive.
There are 2 questions in it, you must answer them now.
 I am waiting for your answer and then I will share my understanding \/ opinion about them.
27/07/22, 03:48 - Leslie EWYL22E0232: 1. Ever since I have been an Edoofian, Edoofa has greatly impacted my life through the sessions and the spirit of oneness and culture of greeting each other through the statement 'i am a Proud Edoofian ' this has also made me sure to do something for it.
2. Like what I have been taught by my mentor the habit of greeting one another keeps the spirit of oneness

27/07/22, 03:56 - Leslie EWYL22E0232: The growth mindset of successful people is that they are responsible for their actions whether the result of their actions is a success or failure and accept accountability for their own choices and results. I believe for one to develop this kind of mindset is to surround himself with other successful people with this kind of mindset because as lots of quotes say the people you spend most of your time with determine your future. Also it also requires commitment. One has to set the goal and  focus themself to accomplish it. To add on, you also have to give yourself time as it is not easy to adapt a mindset like this.
27/07/22, 17:51 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
Wake up and seize the day!
27/07/22, 17:51 - Unknown: To add to our discussion  
Actions that are based on the principles of Oneness are rewarding in the sense that they fill us with happiness and joy, whether or not you get your desired results. Just the act of committing to the effort makes us feel connected to everything and can help heal isolation, loneliness, and helplessness.
Hence in edoofa you can show your commitment and efforts by working on the projects we have, also *as a mentor I understand that projects have a dependency on others for example if some school head is responding or not, whether a company is interested or not etc but for activities and lessons you should keep the focus on top to shine in the community*

28/07/22, 18:21 - Unknown: We are back with our Wednesday lesson.

I realised as soon as I started reading this lesson that most of my students needed to learn and grasp this. One person succeeding and one failing depends solely on how effectively they manage their time. Try to comprehend and apply the measures discussed in the lesson to your everyday life. I'll be here to help you, so that you can focus on learning how to manage your time effectively. In our following session, please explain in detail what you learned from the lesson.Also, do not forget to send *it by 12PM today.*

Happy learning
29/07/22, 01:04 - Leslie EWYL22E0232: Well I learnt that time management is being able to use your time productively and efficiently. People who are able to mange their time are able to do so once they understand the difference between urgent and important tasks. Urgent tasks are the ones that require our immediate attention but they may not matter to us and important tasks are those that consequences if not done. One can use the priority matrix to help manage his time

But the one thing they have in common is that they know how to juggle high-level projects and make sure they spend the bulk of their time on the tasks that are most conducive to their success.
29/07/22, 21:47 - Leslie EWYL22E0232: Yes ma'am
29/07/22, 21:58 - Unknown: In my opinion time management is on you,
Time management is about being about to designate time to complete everything that you need to do, and assigning the 24 hours you have every day to the right task. If you can effectively pair up your time and the things on your to-do list, you will be able to operate at the foundational level of success. How you spend your day is up to you, whether you’re working on a project or you’re watching television all day, you’re responsible for designating your time wisely.

01/08/22, 23:46 - Unknown: A well-constructed timetable establishes a natural rhythm and routine, which can be comforting students as well as their mentors. Having a plan as a learner is very important as it helps you maximize and prioritize on the things that are of urgency or importance. Most students do not have an organized study plan and if they do, they fail to follow the plan drawn. As the Wednesday Wisdom offered advice on how to use our time wisely. You must share your daily schedules with ,e as part of your Saturday activity in a tabular format that you can check on the internet.You can draw it on paper and show it to me.. Do not forget to provide the scheduled time for your EWYL programme.
