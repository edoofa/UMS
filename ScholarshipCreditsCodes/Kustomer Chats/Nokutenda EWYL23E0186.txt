20/06/23, 19:15 - Nokutenda EWYL23E0186: Dr Divine Ndhlukula¬†is currently a Zimbabwean businesswoman, founder and Managing Director of DDNS Security Operations (Pvt) Ltd which is the holding company for SECURICO Security Services and is mostly known for her role in incoorporating women in the security industry. 

She states in a SABC interview seven years ago she neither had a security background or track record and expected the prejudice that came with entering a male dominated industry. However, with the motivation to close the gap of quality services provided by those in the same market. 

To accomplish this she took an open minded approach and decided to employ women for a job mostly done by men. Although this idea took convincing even the women who were applying for the job, this resulted a small scale business transforming into a multi million dollar company. I beleive this is because of her resiliance boldness and ambitiousness, characteristics her fellow workmates use to describe her as mentioned by hot 263. 

Her story resonates with me so well as l also aim to bridge the hole of quality services by closing the gap of technological advancements between my country and other first world countries.
20/06/23, 19:22 - Jasmine Kaur: Thank you for sharing the inspiring story of Dr. Divine Ndhlukula. Her journey in breaking barriers and empowering women in the security industry is truly remarkable. Her boldness, ambition, and resilience have led to the transformation of her small-scale business into a thriving multi-million dollar company. Dr. Ndhlukula's determination to provide quality services and her open-minded approach in employing women have made a significant impact. Her colleagues admire her for these qualities, which have undoubtedly contributed to her success. May her story continue to inspire and motivate others to pursue their dreams fearlessly.

26/06/23, 13:06 - Nokutenda EWYL23E0186: "I always must find a balance between what represents the nickname of 'Iron Lady'- that's where the hard decisions are - and also the one that says 'Ma Ellen' - that brings to the table [the] sensitivity of a mother and a grandmother. Now we need something soft to heal the wounds of our nation." These words spoken by the first african female president herself after the 2005 elections not¬† shows an attentiveness to detail in respect to key problems mainly affecting the masses,but also¬† her ability tactically organise a step by step process to acheive set goals through difficult decisions. 

Having a keen eye that is able to descern the root of problems is essential for any leader in any sector that requires leadership. This results in¬† efficient solutions and use of resources. 
"A battle is won before it is fought."This famous quote from Sun Tzu outlines the importance of being able to create a practically possible step by step process to acheive set targets. 

I personaly aim to acheive these traits by identifying my main targets in life, researching the most probable way used to reach that goal, the problems that have affected most that have tried and find a catered solution in order to ensure success. A brief example would be my A level period, a time where l had set a minimum goal of 14 points. In order to reach this goal l identified my lack of revision and lack of practicing exan questions. This resulted in me taking 2 days off from school and dedicating most of that time to practicing and revising. I hope to acheive these traits with the same dedication and commitment
