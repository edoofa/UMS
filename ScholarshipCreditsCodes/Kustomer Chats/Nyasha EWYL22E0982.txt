Here we are with our weekend activity, it has been some time since we are talking about leadership, and styles of leadership and have even learnt a lot about our leader from Edoofa. It goes without saying that leadership is a skill that one acquires over time and with continuous effort to acquire this characteristic. The EWYL programme, each project and task that is assigned to you, is a direct place for you to practise this skill. This weekend, sit with yourself and write about how you can use the EWYL programme to master the skill of leadership and make a plan for which projects you will prioritise to be a leader in the student community. How will you ensure that your name is on the next list of student leaders for the Edoofa student community? Some of the students have already been recommended as Student Leaders by the mentors; how will you ensure that your name is on the next list of student leaders for the Edoofa student community?
Since a detailed plan is required, the minimum word limit for todayâ€™s activity is 150 words.

The last day to submit your responses is 22-05-2023 and donâ€™t forget only the responses shared here on the dedicated EWYL line will be evaluated.
