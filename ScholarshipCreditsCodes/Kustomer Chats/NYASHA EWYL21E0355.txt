Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment.This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organisations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
20/07/22, 22:01 - NYASHA EWYL21E0355: I'm doing good Sir. How are you doing?

21/07/22, 01:31 - Unknown: As seen above, SWOT is an acronym of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. However, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym:

1 Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
2 Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
3 Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
4 Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by
21/07/22, 02:28 - NYASHA EWYL21E0355: I'm following Sir

21/07/22, 20:51 - Unknown: Did you work on the Wednesday wisdom Nyasha? What are your takeaways from it?
21/07/22, 22:37 - NYASHA EWYL21E0355: Yes Sir. Sometimes we want to blame people because of our failures. I would like to give an example of what l experienced in 2020 when l was in form 6 we did not go to school the whole year and some of us we thought that the government was going to postpone the dates of our examinations but no changes were made. We started to attend classes sometime in November and the exams started in December some of my classmates failed and they started to blame the government but not realising the teacher is only there to give us the course outline not to feed us with information some of my classmates didn't want to study on their own they started blaming the government for their mistakes.
21/07/22, 23:17 - Unknown: Good to read your response on this lesson Edoofian! I am glad that you were able to understand the crux of that which is that successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it, Nyasha1
21/07/22, 23:28 - NYASHA EWYL21E0355: Ok Sir
21/07/22, 23:30 - Unknown: Do you believe you do the same thing Nyasha?
21/07/22, 23:40 - NYASHA EWYL21E0355: Yes  Sir. We all make mistakes and we learn from our mistakes
22/07/22, 00:10 - Unknown: Right Nyasha!
22/07/22, 00:10 - Unknown: Now,Let's say you are working on projects and face challenges on them. How do you proceed with it?
22/07/22, 00:13 - NYASHA EWYL21E0355: First l will ask for your help
22/07/22, 00:41 - Unknown: yes that is correct Nyasha. That should be the first step.
22/07/22, 00:41 - Unknown: However, You have to be the owner of your success Nyasha, you will face many challenges in terms of time management, internet and in regards to efficiency on the projects as well. However, you will have to make sure that you are working on the projects and making the best of the opportunity right?
22/07/22, 02:18 - NYASHA EWYL21E0355: Yes Sir l am following
22/07/22, 19:42 - Unknown: hello Nyasha! How are you doing?
22/07/22, 19:45 - Unknown: Please send the \"I am a proud edoofian\" message of the day.
22/07/22, 21:05 - NYASHA EWYL21E0355: I am fine thank you for asking. How are you doing Sir?
22/07/22, 21:05 - NYASHA EWYL21E0355: I am a proud Edoofian
22/07/22, 21:07 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
