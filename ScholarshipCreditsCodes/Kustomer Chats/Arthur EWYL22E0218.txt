17/05/23, 16:53 - Arthur EWYL22E0218: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am ARTHUR and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Arthur EWYL22E0218‚Äô
20/05/23, 10:34 - Arthur EWYL22E0218: Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am ARTHUR DOTA and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is ARTHUR EWYL22E0218
20/05/23, 10:34 - Arthur EWYL22E0218: I am a proud edoofian
20/05/23, 10:35 - Ananya: `- That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!`

`- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.``- How do you intend to broaden this student community? 

In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.
21/05/23, 22:48 - Arthur EWYL22E0218: First of all, Leadership refers to the quality of leading people. Probably, it is one of the most important aspects of life. Above all, Leadership has led to the progress of human civilization. Without good Leadership, no organization or group can succeed. Furthermore, not everyone has this quality. This is because effective Leadership requires certain important characteristics.
Now, with the aid of the EWYL program which I have been part of for quite some time now, I want to utilize and prioritize the Community Building Project as a project I will use to display characteristics and attributes of a true leader. The reason why I have chosen this project is because it involves the active participation and interaction of me and the students, giving me a platform to display, true leadership values. I will interact with a vast amount of different students and different people with different perspectives and positions, but my sole aim is to show them how much good leadership is a vital necessity in the different levels of association, whether family, school, community or a whole nation. If I do this task I should be able to take a self introspection on whether or not I‚Äôm managing to acquire the different skills that together make up a good leader. It is my hope and aspiration to be named as a good student leader and with inspiration from different individuals I have witnessed raise their flags of leadership high in the Edoofa Community, I think I will be able to do it all.

Share your feelings and expressions in the comments!!
10/06/23, 12:59 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week‚Äôs Wednesday Wisdom was also talking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more and feel better‚Äîtogether. It‚Äôs why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger‚Äîas successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this week's Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relationship, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately develop a stronger network for yourself?

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!

I was ushered to the program by a fellow friend and up to this day as I speak, I have not ceased to be amazed by the very much amazing aspects of the Edoofa scholarship program and my enthusiasm continues to grow as I learn more everyday. One of my favorite key aspects of Edoofa are to do with the EWYL program for the students, and I believe my lifetime dream to being a great physicist can be made amplified by this program considering how much impact it has on my educational journey. I have told many friends about my experience with Edoofa and it is my wish and prayer that this program continues to grow and reach every students struggling with education in Africa. I usually find time to deepen my understanding and that of my friends‚Äô by researching more about India and the Edoofa Society. I even followed all its pages on Social Media so that I can be Up to date with every event taking place within and outside the Edoofa horizon. I‚Äôm looking forward to going to India by end of July and hope to strengthen my relationship with my mentors as I continue with the EWYL program.

Comment if you have been working on the community building project and how many aspiring Edoofians have enrolled through you!
28/06/23, 21:42 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

Team EWYL

30/06/23, 15:53 - Arthur EWYL22E0218: good morning
30/06/23, 15:55 - Ananya: May I ask if you had the opportunity to read the grant document that was shared with you yesterday?
30/06/23, 15:55 - Arthur EWYL22E0218: yes ma‚Äôam

30/06/23, 16:32 - Arthur EWYL22E0218: yes ma‚Äôam
30/06/23, 16:35 - Ananya: In these 21 days, I want that we engage in the best possible manner to bring out fruitful results.

So this time you have to be *REGULAR IN YOUR SESSIONS*


Before we begin, let's go over what a complete session involves. üìö

‚ñ™Ô∏è First of all, you have to *come to the EWYL LINE every single day and tell me HOW PROUD ARE YOU being an Edoofian* (Including Sundays and even on days you don't have your session). This means _following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' without fail on the EWYL Line._

‚ñ™Ô∏è Secondly, It's essential to *arrive on time for the session*, as being late will not be considered as attending a session. _This brings the importance of being punctual for the session._

‚ñ™Ô∏è During our sessions, we'll cover two key topics: the *Wednesday Lesson or Weekend Activity* and *Project Updates*
30/06/23, 16:36 - Arthur EWYL22E0218: noted ma‚Äôam
30/06/23, 16:42 - Ananya: To ensure your progress, I will ask for your Lessons or Activities submissions during the session. It's essential to be prepared and ready to share your work when prompted.üéì
30/06/23, 16:48 - Arthur EWYL22E0218: yes ma‚Äôam
30/06/23, 16:49 - Ananya: Now, let's talk about a challenge that is included in the above-mentioned Project Update! ‚úàÔ∏è
I have set a target for a week, which involves sharing:


*15 Community Building forms*
and
*1 School Connect form*


To mark a session as completed, your active presence is required throughout our session time. If you encounter any network or mobile issues, I recommend addressing them beforehand so that we can make the most of our time together.

Remember, excuses won't be accepted because I believe in your determination.

04/07/23, 15:53 - Ananya: Great, Coming to the point that you might have also noticed and something that brings a flavor to this challenge is Extra Curricular activity


When it comes to overall assessment and evaluation, we believe it's not just about projects and lessons. It's about how passionate you are about yourself. Therefore, there is another aspect for evaluation, which is extracurricular activities.

In the next 21 days, It's your turn to show your amazing talent and be better than all the other students in this thrilling competition. Show everyone what you can do and make them amazed by your skills.
