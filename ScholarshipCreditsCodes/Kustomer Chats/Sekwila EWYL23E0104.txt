22/05/23, 12:29 - Sekwila EWYL23E0104: Greetings Ms Saloni. I am Sekwila Kayoyo and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Sekwila EWYL23E0104.
22/05/23, 17:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Sekwila!
How are you?
22/05/23, 17:20 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
22/05/23, 17:20 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
22/05/23, 17:20 - Saloni Rastogi: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *12:00-01:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
22/05/23, 17:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
30/05/23, 12:05 - Sekwila EWYL23E0104: I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN!!
30/05/23, 12:05 - Saloni Rastogi: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above

 This message serves as a gentle reminder for your Wednesday lesson. It is important to continue learning and developing your skills in order to advance in your career.

28/06/23, 18:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

29/06/23, 11:55 - Sekwila EWYL23E0104: Alex was just an average guy who always  wanted good grades and inspire people because of his achievements, but what he didn't know is that while trying to focus on his external goals Alex was supposed to work on his inner self too.
He never realised how much effort he put in his external ambitions until one moment changed it all, the day he picked the book of identity based habits that taught him how to be a better person for himself and the knowledge of focusing on yourself internally too.
I believe Alex tried to put this certain picture of himself out there that read an achiever but he didn't know that the person he thought he was becoming is not what he wanted to become. So after reading the book he changed his mindset and changed his habits then he later on became the person he truly was and even helped others which made his new determination better and many were inspired by his transformation and hard work.

29/06/23, 15:56 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Sekwila!
How are you?
29/06/23, 15:58 - Saloni Rastogi: I appreciate your kind words! Thank you for acknowledging the response. It's inspiring to see Alex's journey of self-discovery and personal growth. Sometimes, we can become so focused on external achievements that we neglect our inner selves. Alex's realization and willingness to work on his inner self reflect his determination to become a better person for himself and others.
29/06/23, 15:58 - Saloni Rastogi: By picking up the book on identity-based habits, he gained valuable knowledge about self-improvement and the importance of focusing on personal growth. Through changing his mindset and habits, Alex transformed into the person he truly wanted to be. His newfound determination and willingness to help others became a source of inspiration for many.
This story reminds us of the power of self-reflection, growth, and the impact it can have on our lives and those around us. It encourages us to prioritize our inner selves while pursuing external goals. Keep up the great work and continue to inspire others with your own journey of personal development!
29/06/23, 15:59 - Sekwila EWYL23E0104: This story is quite motivational and inspiring truly
29/06/23, 16:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes indeed.
