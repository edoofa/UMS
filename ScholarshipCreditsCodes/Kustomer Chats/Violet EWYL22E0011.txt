17/12/22, 21:46 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, 
_I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?_

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!

04/01/23, 22:37 - Aditi Kapoor: Edoofian, I would like you to know the 3 things that I want to achieve this year :
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Make sure you are able to self-finance your higher education here in India!. For that, Let us start with a smaller target of earning between $30-$50 per month and as we increase our earnings, We will keep increasing this target as well
3. And ensure that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world, workplace and help you grow holistically which we will do by judiciously making use of the lessons and activities
04/01/23, 22:37 - Aditi Kapoor: Also, I wanted to inform you that we won’t be having any sessions Today.

04/01/23, 23:55 - Aditi Kapoor: *Wednesday Lesson | 4 Jan*

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy learning.

\"A goal is not always meant to be reached; it often serves simply as something to aim at.\" –Bruce Lee

The above quote more or less means True success is all about working towards meaningful goals and dreams.

And this was somewhat the idea we learned and discussed in our Wednesday Lesson as well, the mindset of a winner and the habits that lead to it.

In this week's activity, you shall be putting this to use in your own working zone, by creating a list of targets\/goals, that you shall aim to achieve in a week. For a suggestion, you can start by setting up a number of Schools you would try connecting to in a week, the number of companies you shall reach out to, or the number of fellow community mates you would tell about edoofa.

This list, you shall share this with your mentors, and they would also keep a note of it. At the end of the week, you shall discuss with them, whether or not were you able to achieve the target, and what kind of mindset change did this activity lead you to.

Please make the submission using this form:
Project Chosen:
Target:

I hope you all will try to push your limits and aim at the sky always. This activity should be a part of habit building, which would make you a better and more organized individual and professional.

Happy Learning, and Blessed Weekend.

04/11/22, 02:05 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We all have come across the quote, \"Quitters Never Win, and Winners Never Quit\", and we also must have experienced this in our lives, directly or indirectly.

If last week's lesson, taught you the mindset of a winner, this week's lesson is going to teach you the true nature of a winner. Someone, who never gives up, or quits on the dream they see and really want to fulfill, no matter what. Moving through scorching heat, drenching rains, and heavy snow, they reach their destination and complete their journey. In this lesson, you will also learn, what happens when an entire community inherits this trait and keeps working on it. How recognition is earned and respect is gained through time, patience, and endless efforts.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

“My job is not to be easy on people. My job is to make them better.”- Steve Jobs

And till now, our founder Mr. Angad has always been a guiding light for everyone at Edoofa. And has made sure we all turn out to be future leaders in our fields, no matter how hard it seems, we should keep moving with single harmony toward our goals and motives. But, leadership can not only be taught, as it is not a literary subject, but a practical life experience that is to be taken up and practiced and bettered with each passing day.

Hence, after the very encouraging Wednesday lesson on how good leadership and patience can change the entire ideology and perception of a community to grow back from the ashes. Today's Activity is going to give you a first-hand experience to fit yourselves in a small part of the leadership shoes. I want you to create a newsletter of your own. Similar to the ones you have enjoyed reading every Sunday from the founder's office.

Your Newsletter should consider the following things:  Quotes that have been motivating you for some time now, or your three favorite quotes which motivate you to be better every day.
and,
2. One story of your idol, that can be any person, who according to you has contributed to making the community and world a better place for people to live. The story should also consist of a part stating the reason why they are your idol.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own capabilities while performing this activity.

The best newsletters of the week shall be shared with all the fellow edoofians next week.

Have a wonderful weekend ahead.

Greetings My Dear Proud Edoofian!

\"Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.\" ~ Bruce Lee

In this week's Wednesday lesson, you learned about the different sorts of personalities a person carries, but only a true leader is one who understands their personality and can do wonders with its power. In today's activity, I want you to dig deeper into your own consciousness and learn more about the kind of personality you are. As I believe, the more you know yourself, the clearer your vision of the world and your mind gets. Below is a link to a personality test, which you shall be taking up this week, and then would be sharing the results via a screenshot to your mentors by Monday. You can then read and understand more about your results by discussing them with your Mentor.

Link to the Test:  exercise is going to give you an insight into the kind of person you are so that you can use your strengths to yield the maximum benefits in whatever work you take up.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own personality while performing this activity.
16/11/22, 21:27 - Unknown: Last Week's Wednesday Lesson

Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian,

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.
16/11/22, 21:33 - Violet EWYL22E0011: Thanks
17/11/22, 05:36 - Unknown: Wednesday Lesson

Hello, my dear proud Edoofian. I hope all is well with you.

Another insightful Wednesday Wisdom is presented here. The lesson today teaches us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, disability. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition. A few questions near the end of the session will ask you to reflect and have an open dialogue with yourself. After you finish your lesson, as your mentor, I'd like to have a thorough conversation about your key take aways, in our upcoming sessions.

Enjoy the article and keep in mind that success does not come to you suddenly; rather, it can be attained over time by making modest, daily improvements.

Happy learning!

17/11/22, 18:36 - Unknown: We will be having our session at 4:30 PM Indian Time i.e. 1:00 PM Zimb Time Tomorrow
Before, We start with our session tomorrow, I would like you to go through some important information that I am sharing below:

To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages. Let us get a better understanding of the three stages!

Your counselor is your first point of contact. Your counselor has been guiding you during your onboarding process where you learnt about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your Admissions Officer {Miss Vilsha\/Mr. Milan}.I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now you must be aware that all your admissions related queries like: your VISA process, Registration fees, AAL etc. would be addressed\/handled by the Admissions Team. 
Note: Your EWYL mentor\/counselor will not be addressing your admission queries
Finally you will be starting your EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor, where you get a chance to learn 21st century job skills and earn your scholarship credits which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
17/11/22, 18:36 - Unknown: Wednesday Lesson

Hello, my dear proud Edoofian. I hope all is well with you.

Another insightful Wednesday Wisdom is presented here. The lesson today teaches us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, disability. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition. A few questions near the end of the session will ask you to reflect and have an open dialogue with yourself. After you finish your lesson, as your mentor, I'd like to have a thorough conversation about your key take aways, in our upcoming sessions.

Enjoy the article and keep in mind that success does not come to you suddenly; rather, it can be attained over time by making modest, daily improvements.

Happy learning!
