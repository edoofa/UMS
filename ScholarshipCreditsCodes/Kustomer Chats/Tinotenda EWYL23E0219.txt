As we embark on a new year, it's the perfect time to reflect on our aspirations and set goals for personal and academic growth. To kick off our Saturday activity, we invite you to share the goals you've set for yourself in the upcoming year, 2024.üéØ

Whether your goals are related to academics, personal development, extracurricular activities, or any other aspect of your life, we want to hear about them! This is a wonderful opportunity for us to inspire and support one another as a community.

Please take a moment to jot down your goals and be prepared to share them during our Saturday activity. It could be something as simple as improving your study habits, achieving a certain grade, learning a new skill, or even fostering better connections with your peers.‚ú®

Remember, setting goals is not only a way to envision your future but also a roadmap to success. By sharing your goals, you might inspire someone else to reach for their dreams as well.

Let's make 2024 a year of growth, achievement, and mutual support. We look forward to hearing about your aspirations during our Saturday activity.ü§ù

Best regards,
Team EWYL

How are you doing?
21/09/23, 14:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Before we begin, as we have come on the EWYL Line, you have already completed some basic formalities. Now, I would want that we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.

I kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
21/09/23, 14:46 - Tinotenda EWYL23E0219: Since you don't recommend parents to proceed with the session on behalf of the students let's put on hold but was willing to continue with sessions
