How are you?
01/10/22, 19:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Please share your response to the Wednesday wisdom Varaidzo, I am eagerly waiting for your understanding.
01/10/22, 19:48 - Saloni Rastogi: I am resharing the Wednesday wisdom with you.
01/10/22, 20:05 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, my dear Edoofians,
In the past week's lesson, we learned about the importance of networking and collaboration and how they can help us in becoming successful professionals. In today's lesson, we want to take a step back to remind you why are we learning these skills every week. Every successful professional has their focus on results, they are outcome\/output driven. Let's discuss today, what our outcome is with respect to learning these skills and working on these projects. We want to share how one of our current recruitment partners, who also started as an international student is now creating employability for Edoofians. Let's learn from her journey on how to become successful.

After you go through the document and the audio, please refer to the video links mentioned below. These videos highlight our star performers who got to collaborate with our recruitment partner's team and also a glimpse into how this international student turned African entrepreneur thinks when she looks at young African students.

I am unable to understand what the  Wednesday task is requiring me to do. Can you kindly assist with that please?
01/10/22, 20:35 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, sure Varaidzo.
01/10/22, 20:35 - Saloni Rastogi: Since you raised your concerns about your understanding of the Wednesday lesson, let me bring some light to it:
1. The main focus of the lesson was on how you are willing to earn scholarship credits through projects
2. Your plan to take forward this zeal, how do you target to achieve them

How are you?
04/10/22, 20:41 - Saloni Rastogi: This weekend's activity was very interesting. I am very excited to discuss how you, my proud student, have planned your way to becoming _the edoofian of the month_ and _accomplishing their targets_. This weekend activity asked students to tell the following:
a) Target- no. of credits you want to earn in October
b) How many projects can you work upon
c) Number of hours that you can devote to your projects
d) Name of the projects that you want to be a part of
e) Plan of action with your mentors

In our session on the *EWYL Line*, we will be discussing:
1. your response to the same
04/10/22, 21:04 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: Ok ms. I have sent that response
05/10/22, 20:02 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Varaidzo!
How are you?
05/10/22, 20:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for the inconvenience caused in yesterday's session, I was facing severe connectivity issues so I was not able to take your session.
Your session will be held on Friday as per our schedule since the organization is observing an off today on the eve of our religious festival, Dussehra.
Once I come back on Friday for your session, I want that you get some research done on what is Dussehra and why it is celebrated, we will surely discuss it in our session on Friday along with your weekend activity response, which will be very much exciting?
05/10/22, 20:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'.

Hence we must treat it important that we treat our Time as the currency of life. *Time Management* is essentially Priority Management.

In our session today on the *EWYL Line*, we will discuss:
1. How managing time is necessary

08/10/22, 18:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you please share your response o the Wednesday lesson please.
08/10/22, 18:21 - Saloni Rastogi: I am sharing your weekend report card. Have a look at it and let me know your concerns.
08/10/22, 18:24 - Saloni Rastogi: The progress so far with the responses and following the proud edoofian ritual is not well.
Along with this, what I am concerned more about is our scholarship target for this month that you have set, how are we going to achieve that?
We need to plan that and work on it from today onwards.
I don't expect any late back attitude from you, I want to work very hard for you but it will only fructify when you will put equivalent and solid efforts into that.
-Tell me what project are you choosing
- how are you working on it
- per day target to achieve the same
08/10/22, 19:17 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: I am choosing the community building project. 
I will get in touch with A level students who have a desire to study abroad and will help them understand what the Edoofa scholarship program is all about and also inform them about the expenses associated with it. And if they are interested I will get them connected. But if they are not sure about the funds, I will explain and convince them how helpful the Edoofa scholarship program is.

To add more to that, you had once told me to submit 2 application forms everyday but it was a challenge for me, so I have decided I will be submitting the application forms of students on every Saturday.
09/10/22, 15:59 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Varaidzo!
How are you?
09/10/22, 16:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Some of my students have formed a WhatsApp group for the community-building project where they:
First, keep sharing the link of the group in their family groups, class groups, and school groups, with the children who stay nearby, and, try to circulate all around.
Second, once new people get added to the group, they are told about Edoofa and it the perks of being associated with it.
Third, they share the community building form with them, and then the children fill out the form and share it with the group.

What do you think about this?
09/10/22, 16:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. Those unfamiliar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.
Responses will be accepted on the *EWYL Line* only.
_Till then keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'_.

Happy learning and enjoy your weekend!

Take an instance, where you have worn a shirt, have a decent background, stable camera; the video would have looked more appealing and outshining.
12/10/22, 18:20 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: Ok
Ms. Thank you for that, I sure will try that in my next video
12/10/22, 18:20 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: I am doing great thanks
13/10/22, 00:53 - Saloni Rastogi: That's great, I hope you have understood what I said.
13/10/22, 00:53 - Saloni Rastogi: We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real-life example. That is how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because in the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.
Responses will be submitted on the EWYL Line only.

Happy Learning.

15/10/22, 19:45 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: Good morning Ms Saloni
I have gone through Wode  Maya's videos and I have been so amazed, fascinated by the what he's offering to the world through his social media platforms. From just being an engineering student, Wode Maya was able to create a career for himself through social media and creating and coming up with ideas which really took his social life to the next level. And now he is touring Africa, discovering great things done by the African people that were never known by the world. This has really made an impact on the young Ghanaian because now he is associating himself with different kinds of people by travelling in different parts of the world and standing up for Africa, bringing out the best about Africa.
From just being a student in a native country, he was able to come up with ideas quicker to help him fund and support himself in his academics. 
As for me I have been so wanting to create a good recognizable image of myself on social media but I have been lacking the courage and confidence to do so. But after watching how Wode   Maya did it, I am going to start building a better social life of my own. In this modern world now we are living, social media has taken over, it is now the source of everything.

So yesterday, everyone in our office wore Ethnic dresses and celebrate Deepawali's party where we exchanged gifts and lit up the office with diyas and candles.
Due to this, there was a delay in sending you the Wednesday lesson for this week.
Please see to it and we will have a session tomorrow on the same because I want to give you time to ponder and work on it.
20/10/22, 20:34 - Saloni Rastogi: In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

21/10/22, 17:47 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

13/07/22, 21:49 - Unknown: Good afternoon *VARAIDZO*!
How's your day going?
13/07/22, 21:50 - Unknown: I am so glad to see your importance of being a proud edoofian.
13/07/22, 21:53 - Unknown: In your response, you submitted earlier,  I want to highlight that through this activity my main motive was the make you realize that now you are not just a student but our future entrepreneurs who can figure out the problem and have the courage to solve them. You need to know that efforts made in the right direction can lead to outshining results  Only having a passion for the cause is not necessary, along with efforts we have to efficiently use all the resources around us and make full use of them. Like you have EDOOFA's EWYL program through which you can learn amazing skills, practical knowledge, leadership skills, and whatnot. When we have a vision, we can always find a solution. Remember, we have to make some sacrifices to make our dreams turn into reality and I know, you can achieve all that you have planned. I have full faith in you.
13/07/22, 21:56 - Unknown: Varaidzo you submitted your response quite late, may I know the reason behind your late response?
13/07/22, 22:41 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: Im  sorry Ms, I had trouble with network this side but everything is all good now.
13/07/22, 23:11 - Unknown: Okay Varaidzo, noted the updated.
13/07/22, 23:17 - Unknown: Varaidzo since you did not share your response to your last to last week's activity, I did not share last week's activity and lesson with you because then you would have been pilled up with so much work.
13/07/22, 23:17 - Unknown: Now I know you are all ready for the amazing lesson and activity.
13/07/22, 23:18 - Unknown: *WEDNESDAY LESSON*
Here we have another dose of Wednesday wisdom on our most loved topic of Entrepreneurship. Yes, today’s lesson is going to talk about a sincere and passionate young female entrepreneur who has made her mark on the African Start up ecosystem. She is an award-winning UI\/UX Designer with seven years of experience working in the technology environment. We are talking about Oluwadamilola Soyombo, the founder of Skooqs. Today’s lesson will take us through the incident when Skooqs was born. I am sure a very valuable lesson is there for all of us to learn from. \u2028\u2028Also, I would like to highlight that Skooqs has partnered with Edoofa and will be working closely on providing our students with projects to work on and gain experience.  The first batch is already assigned the project. \u2028\u2028Go through the audio and pdf carefully and let me know if you have any concerns.
13/07/22, 23:30 - Unknown: *WEEKEND ACTIVITY*
You must have learned how critical it is to take advantage of every opportunity. In our Wednesday Wisdom this week, we discussed a profitable business- Skooqs. Do you know that Skooqs was developed in just five days!! Thanks to Oluwadamilola Soyombo's (Founder of Skooqs), diligence and use of the opportunity. The use of the opportunity at the right time with the right skills is currently creating a significant impact on the African entrepreneurial ecosystem.  And well some of you, because of your consistency, diligence, willingness to show up for your sessions, and performance in your weekly activities have gotten this opportunity to work on a project with Skooqs. 

You are probably aware of the possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. This week, I want you to think of a few skills or practices that a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits. 
Please list the skills that are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring in a lot of learning.
16/07/22, 20:30 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: This lesson taught me that, it may seem like you may be out of ideas or greater suggestions to start a business just like other huge organisations, but the best things can come from simple ideas. Oluwadamilola Soyombo also didn't think she could come up with a great idea but she thought of helping African students by founding *Sqooks*, the first online learning platform which where African children can get access to technology and create  courses at a young age.
16/07/22, 20:30 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: Good morning. I am a proud Edoofian.
16/07/22, 20:30 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: I have sent last week's Wednesday task
16/07/22, 20:32 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride.

Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

16/07/22, 21:40 - Unknown: Greetings Varaidzo!
How's your day going?
16/07/22, 21:42 - Unknown: I read your response to the last Wednesday's wisdom and I must say that your opinions and views reflect clarity of idea. Not just this, your simplified understanding of our  young African entrepreneur,
*Oluwadamilola Soyombo* assures me that you have that zeal and passion to turn your dreams and ambitions into a _big successful reality_. 
The main idea behind this is to you realize that where there is a DESIRE to work hard, there is always a PATH that can take you to favorable outcomes. I know you are putting in all your efforts and I very well appreciate them, but I know you are capable to do much more than this, it is just about taking one more step ahead of others that will make you outshine in this crowd of millions of people.
This project also highlighted Edoofa's Training and Development partner Skooqs.
16/07/22, 21:43 - Unknown: I am really glad to hear your understanding of the last weekend's activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY*. They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.
16/07/22, 21:46 - Unknown: Now I am sharing with you this week's Wednesday wisdom as well as a weekend activity, hoping to see a positive response again from you Varaidzo, in the similar way you have done the previous week's task.
16/07/22, 21:53 - Unknown: I have shared it on the EWYL group.
16/07/22, 22:38 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: Ok Ms thank yo
16/07/22, 22:39 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: Ok Ms I sure will do so
17/07/22, 04:11 - Unknown: I'll be waiting for your response.
19/07/22, 19:29 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: Patrice Thlopane Motsepe a South African entrepreneur, was born not so rich to a father who was just a school teacher with a very small business that he owned.
As he grew up he liked to venture into business and was open minded. He figured out how to start a business of his own. As time went on, he went on to further his business and because of his commitment, hard work and good entrepreneurial skills he was able to achieve success. Today he is now in the list of top successful people in the world.
19/07/22, 19:29 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: Good morning, I am a proud Edoofian
19/07/22, 19:31 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride.

19/07/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello my proud EDOOFIAN!
I hope you are doing well.
SWOT analysis might sound something complex but I am sure that while going through our weekend activity, you might have gone through what a SWOT means thoroughly and gained much knowledge on the same. The weekend activity asked us to draw a SWOT analysis of any company.
I want to share your response with me here Varaidzo.
19/07/22, 22:11 - Unknown: I read your response to the Wednesday lesson Varaidzo and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a way. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. With can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.
19/07/22, 22:12 - Unknown: Now please share your response to the weekend activity as well.
19/07/22, 22:13 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: Thank you
19/07/22, 22:13 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: Ok
20/07/22, 01:53 - Unknown: I hope you have penned down your thoughts on the weekend activity as well, please share them with me. I am very excited to discuss that with you.
20/07/22, 05:40 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: The fast growing business in my country, Zimbabwe

In Zimbabwe, due to the state of our economy, most people have not been able to make a living out of something that is well respectable. So most citizens have resorted to making deals to financially support their families.
The business that has grown fast over the past few years, has been online forex trading. It is when foreign currencies are bought and are sold at an open market. People have been making deals online to make money.
Most have been earning a lot with this type of business.

With just training students this type of marketing, people in different areas are earning a lot of money. One could teach upto like 200 students and charge a certain amount of money, thats also a way of earning money.
So online marketing has become a life saver to most and has also created better livings for the present and future.
20/07/22, 05:41 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: Sorry Ms I couldn't send the response on time

22/07/22, 03:34 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Varaidzo!
How's your day going?
22/07/22, 03:35 - Unknown: Don't worry about the late response, in such cases, it is better you inform me beforehand.
22/07/22, 03:37 - Unknown: I read your response to the weekend activity and you know it made me so inquisitive to know about the forex market in Zimbabwe and look what I found  forex traders in Zimbabwe have a refreshed opportunity to participate in the global financial markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe (SECZ) says very little of regulation in the retail trader space, but Zimbabwean investors can still take advantage of brokers regulated through neighboring entities.
Your response has been very elaborative and knowledgeable, great to hear that.
22/07/22, 03:38 - Unknown: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.
22/07/22, 03:40 - Unknown: Yes Varaidzo, you can submit your response now but I will discuss it in your session tomorrow.
22/07/22, 04:17 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: Thank you Ms?
22/07/22, 04:18 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: Ok I understand.
22/07/22, 04:19 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: Everyone in life, whether business entrepreneurs or even the most wise, make mistakes and everyone, nomatter how great they are will always come across failure.
But yes it may be difficult or you may think you're too smart to be called a failure but it's completely normal. It is not wise to blame other people for a failure in a company or in our day-to-day lives. Successful people don't play the blame game, that's pointing fingers at other people, for example employees or work mates, when they fail to achieve something in life.

So from this lesson I learnt if I fail during an investment, it is most wise to think of better ways to get the service running again than waste time blaming other people. Like Patrice Motsepe, when he realised his  business was going down, he thought of wiser ways to keep his business running and bring up new skills that made him successful.
Failing, is sometimes good. Why? Because when you fail to achieve something the first time, you will put all your effort and mind together next time to get it right. But if you don't accept failure and place it on others, it will only lead to more and more failure in life. Because when you accept what has occurred it will help you think of better ways to fix the service on a more convenient way.
22/07/22, 05:30 - Unknown: Great, we will discuss tomorrow.
22/07/22, 19:16 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: Good morning
22/07/22, 19:16 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: I am a proud Edoofian
22/07/22, 19:17 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation.

22/07/22, 22:51 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Varaidzo!
How's your day going?
22/07/22, 22:52 - Unknown: I read your response Varaidzo and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
22/07/22, 22:52 - Unknown: So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom (already discussed)
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
22/07/22, 23:03 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: Ok Ms
22/07/22, 23:04 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: On our three ongoing projects, I have been working on community building. But the first one, corporate alliance, I didn't clearly understand what it's eequiring me to do or how to do it.
22/07/22, 23:05 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: And the last project, im still working on it
22/07/22, 23:06 - Varaidzo EWYL21E0731: So can I send the application forms of the students that wish to further their studies abroad?
23/07/22, 02:56 - Unknown: As for project 1, before working on them , I want you to have a look at the guide first.
23/07/22, 02:58 - Unknown: When you go through it, let me share your understanding with me, and then I will explain further.
23/07/22, 03:04 - Unknown: As for project 2, you have to approach students who are appearing at their A-level or O-level, and yes, they should have some interest in studying in India. If they don't have one, you can surely convince them to study in India and share these forms with them and get them filled out, our counselors will reach out to them. I want to set a target for you Varaidzo, I am sure you can get 2 forms filled daily and share them with me. What do you think?

24/07/22, 17:52 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

26/07/22, 20:50 - Unknown: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

Yesterday I had an amazing day. I went to the airport to receive all my proud Edoofians and I had tears in my eyes seeing their happiness and enthusiasm. I want you to look at it and share your thoughts with me.
26/07/22, 20:53 - Unknown: Along with this, we can have our session:
''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''

The weekend activity clearly talked about what are the growing mindsets of successful people. 
I would really appreciate it if you share your understanding with me on the same and what you think can take you to the top.
