Let us start our day with a quote: “Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.”

The inner sense of captaincy is a vital component of leadership that gives individuals the confidence and determination to make a positive impact. It involves having a deep understanding of oneself, embracing weaknesses, and having a positive growth-oriented mindset. Developing an inner sense of captaincy can help individuals navigate challenges, inspire and motivate others, and tap into their full potential as leaders. In today’s Wednesday wisdom, we will explore the importance of this aspect of leadership. 

We will discuss your key learnings in our today’s session!
09/02/23, 23:56 - Nokuthaba EWYL22E0645: What I got from today's lesson is that a leader is supposed to have a sense of inner captaincy within..

An inner senseof captaincy helps leadersto have confidence and be able to overcome challenges by being very decisive..

For one to develop one's inner captaincy ,we have to evaluate ourselves by being able to identify your weaknesses and mistakes..

13/02/23, 21:10 - Jasmine Kaur: One morning, an elderly man was walking along the beach when he noticed a young boy picking something off the sand and throwing it into the sea.

As he got closer, the man realized the child was throwing stranded starfishes that had washed up on the shore back into the breaking waves.

Approaching the boy, the man asked what he was doing.

“The starfish will die if they’re still on the shore when the sun rises,” he replied.

Perplexed, the old man said, “But that’s pointless! There are countless miles of beach and thousands of starfish. It doesn’t matter how many you return to the water, you can’t make a difference.”

Unfazed, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish, and tossed it into the sea.

“It matters to this one,” he said.","transform":"

14/02/23, 02:02 - Nokuthaba EWYL22E0645: I was asked to become a leader for a Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics ( STEM) club.

Zimbabwe schools were going to have exhibition competitions,so my school was going to take part in the competition. So when the announcement was made ,I was appointed as the vice captain cause I was the only student from my grade and  also the youngest in the club.
Mr
The reason behind me being the vice captain was so that they could groom me for next year since my seniors would not be there with me. Thats how I became a leader for a school club.

It did not take long before the Leader quited the club and since I was the vice captain I had to take her position.
I was quite skeptical about taking the position cause I knew that it was going to be hard for the seniors to listen to a junior like me.But because of my teacher's encouragement and support I ended up agreeing.

Because of the support I had ,I also became confident in my self. I and my club members were able to choose a project for the exhibition. So when I suggested a to my teacher project she was hesitant about it, so I reasoned with her until everyone got the idea.

Along the way whilst researching as a team, I  faced problems. Being young I had to tolerate critism from the seniors, they thought I didn't have the capability to be a leader when there were seniors in the club too.

With the help of my mother,I came with the first presentation to the club, it well versed such that no one could refute with anything said.So when I got approval from my club members I was quite happy this helped me to eliminater self doubt. So at the end ,we had to make appointments with managers from places we were going to visit. This was quite challenging because we faced rejections and this demoralized my friends. So as the leader I cheered them up, gave them motivations and all. As the leader I had to go a step further so that I could boost my teammates by not giving up easily, so I had to talk to the ma

07/03/23, 18:34 - Nokuthaba EWYL22E0645: From my research Netflorist company has been successful mainly because of their hard work and dedication.
Netflorist company started as an experimental online store that was supposed to be open to sell a few flowers especially on Valentine's day then close.
But then at the end of  the month, the company had made a lot money,,this was a sign of a good opportunity to start a good online store.

After that,, the Bacher brothers started drafting,planning and focused on building their brand.

1. What made  Florist company successful at first was the ability for them to see the need to find help by making an agreement with Sandton florist company.
This was because the bachers had no idea on how to arrange flower ,let alone how tho deliver them.
They were able to identify their weaknesses and work on them
2. They worked hard as a team to keep their company running.

The company's vision, mission statement and objectives  helped the company to grow bigger.

-These included taking note of the people's interests and serving them to their satisfaction.
Taking advantage of how customer needs change, taste and preferences gave the company an opportunity to grow till this day as it gave them new business opportunities.
The company provides quality products and tried by all means to have lower charges.
3.Most important of all, their marketing was top notch. The company has a strong online presence in different social networking sites for advertisements and all.
Lastly the Bacher brothers always had something to Motivate their employees,this made them work harder and more effectively.

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr
17/12/22, 19:01 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian, how are you doing?
Today I wanted to discuss the recent message I shared with you. The message that we want to be our daily habit, our words of connecting and experiencing a sense of belonging, We all at team Edoofa are very thrilled as we personally are undertaking the same activity. May I know what have you understood from this message, what is the intention behind the same?

18/12/22, 17:31 - Nokuthaba EWYL22E0645: I am a proud edofian
18/12/22, 17:32 - Aditi Kapoor: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
18/12/22, 17:35 - Nokuthaba EWYL22E0645: Thank you for the reminder.
19/12/22, 17:50 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello, my proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well.
