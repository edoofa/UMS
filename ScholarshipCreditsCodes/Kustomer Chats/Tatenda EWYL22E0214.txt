12/07/22, 17:44 - Tatenda EWYL22E0214: Understood sir
12/07/22, 18:14 - Unknown: Great!
12/07/22, 20:39 - Unknown: Tatenda, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.
This way you will always be recognized by the Academics Board for new projects.
12/07/22, 20:41 - Tatenda EWYL22E0214: Yes sir I understand
13/07/22, 16:33 - Tatenda EWYL22E0214: Good morning sir
I am a proud Edoofian!
13/07/22, 16:35 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

I hope that you are in good health and spirits ✨

In the past couple of days, You might have noticed that I was not very active on the EWYL DEDICATED LINE.

This was due to Arrival of 72 Edoofians who came this week.
I am very happy to inform you that all of them are settled and are busy with exploring the universities. ?

Today is the last day of their Admission Processes, So I would be visiting the universities to make sure everything goes well.

We will be starting our regular sessions with full flow from *Monday*.
Till then, I would like you to work on the *EWYL PROJECTS*.

Also, Make sure that you perform the *Proud Edoofian* Ritual on the *EWYL DEDICATED LINE* on Saturday and Sunday as well.
The chain should not break.

Have a blessed day ahead⭐
