Its time for our Saturday Activity, I want you to delve into the realm of inspiration and write a detailed essay about a person whom you know personally and who embodies the remarkable trait of consistency. This individual has consistently demonstrated their dedication, determination, and unwavering commitment, becoming a true source of inspiration for you.

In your essay, please explore the key aspects of their life, experiences, and actions that exemplify their consistent nature. Describe how their consistent approach has positively influenced and impacted not only their own life but also the lives of those around them. Reflect on specific instances or situations where their consistent behavior or mindset has motivated you to strive for excellence or overcome challenges in your own life.

Feel free to include personal anecdotes, observations, or conversations that highlight the impact this person's consistency has had on your growth and development. Additionally, analyze the qualities, values, or strategies that you believe contribute to their ability to maintain consistency over time.
I am excited to read your insightful essays and learn about the inspiring individuals who have demonstrated the power of consistency.
Best regards,
Team EWYL

14/07/23, 16:52 - Asher EWYL23E0188: Trying so hard encouraging feed backs .l have talked to 2 school heads and they say they will give me the dates
14/07/23, 16:53 - Ananya: Great, 2) You can try searching for schools on Google
-Let me share with you how our star performer for the last week-Loice did complete her targets.
She shared three schools and you know she got to know about them through Google.
She simply searched on Google like 'School nearby'/'School in Harare'/'School in Manicaland' and so on. She was able to yield results.
So even without physically visiting them, she got to know about them through Google, got their contact details, and after that got in touch with them Via WhatsApp.
3)  please reach out to all your friends, peers, cousins, neighbors, school mates, to get their School Head's contact details.
4)  visit schools in your province, physical visits can add another touch to the conversations and make them a lot more impactful.
14/07/23, 16:54 - Asher EWYL23E0188: Then as for the community building projects Im still encouraging them to apply
14/07/23, 16:57 - Ananya: Great, I want you to try your best. Now let us connect in our next session. Happy weekend and all the best!
