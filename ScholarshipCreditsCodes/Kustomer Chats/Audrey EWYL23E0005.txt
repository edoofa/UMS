Welcome to the EWYL Line, I am Ms. Saloni.
22/09/23, 15:36 - Saloni Rastogi: Before we begin, as you have come on the EWYL Line, you have already completed some basic formalities. Now, I would want that we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.

I kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let me know.

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on Slice Con'24‚Äîit was seriously awesome! The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. üöÄ
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The AI sessions were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Toolsü§ñ

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win‚Äîfun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing thingsü§©‚ù§Ô∏è
