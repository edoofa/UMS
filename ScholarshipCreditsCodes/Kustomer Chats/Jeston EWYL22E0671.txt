02/02/23, 19:36 - Jeston EWYL22E0671: I am a proud Edoofian
08/02/23, 00:47 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr

11/02/23, 19:57 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

You are required to share your responses by DATE over here at the EYWL Line.
11/02/23, 20:49 - Jeston EWYL22E0671: So it was there was a day at school when there was a physics seminar at our school and someone was needed to lead the presentations. I volunteered to be the leader of the presentations and faced quite a lot of challenges such as the students were reluctant to participate and there were others  who were rude. So I had to be quite tough and also be free to the other students so that I could restore order and at the same time I had to make learning enjoyable
11/02/23, 21:16 - Jasmine Kaur: Leadership is about making a positive impact on the world around us, and I know that you have the drive and determination to do just that. Your passion for becoming successful and contributing to society is inspiring, and I believe that you could use that passion to make a difference in the lives of others.

I would like to encourage you to take on challenges and opportunities that will help you develop your leadership skills. This could be in the form of student government, leadership training programs, or mentorship opportunities. These experiences will not only help you grow as a leader but will also give you the chance to make a positive impact in your community.
11/02/23, 21:23 - Jeston EWYL22E0671: Yes I believe so and I'm willing to go an extra mile so that I will achieve great success in everything I do and become the greatest leader
11/02/23, 21:26 - Jasmine Kaur: I am sure Jeston.
11/02/23, 21:50 - Jeston EWYL22E0671: I will do my best in my sessions

13/02/23, 18:29 - Jasmine Kaur: One morning, an elderly man was walking along the beach when he noticed a young boy picking something off the sand and throwing it into the sea.

As he got closer, the man realized the child was throwing stranded starfishes that had washed up on the shore back into the breaking waves.

Approaching the boy, the man asked what he was doing.

“The starfish will die if they’re still on the shore when the sun rises,” he replied.

Perplexed, the old man said, “But that’s pointless! There are countless miles of beach and thousands of starfish. It doesn’t matter how many you return to the water, you can’t make a difference.”

Unfazed, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish, and tossed it into the sea.

“It matters to this one,” he said.","transform":"

13/02/23, 22:13 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Afternoon dear!
 I hope you are having a fantastic start to your day. Today, I would like to share a motivational quote with you. It goes like this:

\"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.\"  Roosevelt
This quote inspires us to hold on to our dreams and believe in their power to shape our future. It reminds us to have faith in ourselves and our abilities, and to keep striving towards what we truly desire. So, hold on to your dreams and keep working towards making them a reality. Have a wonderful day!

13/02/23, 22:17 - Jasmine Kaur: Jeston i am watching that how hard-working and passionate you are to achieve your goals. After reading your response to the Saturday activity, I felt so good. Your depth of understanding and ability to articulate your thoughts clearly were truly impressive.
13/02/23, 22:17 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes of course Jeston.
13/02/23, 22:18 - Jasmine Kaur: So Jeston, What are your targets for this week?

13/02/23, 22:25 - Jasmine Kaur: That's great to hear that you're interested in learning Java! It's a fantastic choice for a first programming language.
13/02/23, 22:26 - Jeston EWYL22E0671: Yeah I'm really enjoying it
13/02/23, 22:27 - Jeston EWYL22E0671: Okay I can't wait to hear about this strategy
13/02/23, 22:29 - Jasmine Kaur: So, I would suggest you to work on the Community building and School connect project simultaneously.
13/02/23, 22:31 - Jasmine Kaur: First of all make a Whatsapp group and add your friends, classmates, batchmates, Neighbours, and siblings to that group. 
Add the people who you think deserve the opportunity to earn a scholarship and abroad higher education.
13/02/23, 22:35 - Jeston EWYL22E0671: Okay noted
13/02/23, 22:39 - Jasmine Kaur: For this week try to submit 5 community-building offline applications to me along with 2 schools connect forms.
 Out of the 2 schools, one school can be yours and for the second school try to search for schools in your locality and approach them.
13/02/23, 22:39 - Jasmine Kaur: They can be your friend's school, or neighbor's school, or sibling's school. 
Try to build connections with the students studying in different schools and share your WhatsApp link with them.
13/02/23, 22:40 - Jeston EWYL22E0671: Consider it done
13/02/23, 22:41 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Jeston. I am sure you won't disappoint me.
13/02/23, 22:51 - Jeston EWYL22E0671: Yes ma'am I won't
13/02/23, 22:52 - Jasmine Kaur: You are following the right path dear. If you face any difficulty or need guidance then I am here for you. 
Keep working hard and amaze me by completing your targets by the end of this week.
13/02/23, 22:52 - Jasmine Kaur: Before we wrap up, I want to acknowledge your active participation. Your thoughts have definitely enriched our discussion today
We shall connect on Wednesday for our Wednesday Wisdom lesson.

Have you ever wondered what the one governing principle that governs all businesses might be? What is the name of the one value that every company considers to be crucial? Have you ever heard of something called the North Star Metric?

North Star Metric is a key business metric that reflects the core value a product delivers to its customers. It's a single, actionable metric that aligns all efforts towards achieving long-term growth. Let us learn about in greater detail, read the lesson carefully and we will connect in our upcoming scheduled session.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

17/03/23, 17:58 - Jeston EWYL22E0671: Okay so the lesson encourages us to seek for wealth not money or status because seeking for money or status only can cause stress, depression or even anxiety. In order to avoid that we should build a passive source of income such as real estate or invest in assets that can generate money for us while we are asleep

17/03/23, 18:03 - Jasmine Kaur: I think you've brought up a good point. Building a passive source of income can definitely be a great strategy for achieving financial stability and security.

 Investing in real estate or other assets that can generate income can provide a reliable source of funds that can supplement or even replace one's active income.
