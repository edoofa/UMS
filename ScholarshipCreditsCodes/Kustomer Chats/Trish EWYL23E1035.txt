23/01/24, 15:13 - Trish EWYL23E1035: Persistence and Resilience in the the book "Think and Grow Rich" are one of my favourite principles as they are important in one's journey through life.Being persistent is continuing to do something in a determined way and to be resilient is to be able to quickly became healthy, happy or strong again after a certain challenge.
A life without struggles is a life not worth living for. Persistence and Resilience are principles that push a person to not give up but to embrace the challenges of life and paves a way for the person to focus on their goals. I have my role model, Sarah Jakes Roberts, the daughter of TD Jakes who fell pregnant at the age of 13. Any person would loose hope and give up at the thought of this challenge,but through her , we learn that being persistent and resilient, you can overcome any situation despite how huge, traumatic and hard it is . Today she is one of the well known business women, author and a pastor who has changed many lives of women in my generation. Sarah Jakes Robert's ability to not give up and to change her pain and struggle into power and a opportunity for young woman like us to learn from her shows persistence and Resilience.
23/01/24, 15:41 - Aditi Kapoor: Good Afternoon on this beautiful day!‚ú®
Hope you are well.

Let's begin with today's discussionüöÄ
23/01/24, 15:42 - Trish EWYL23E1035: You may proceed ü§ó
23/01/24, 15:45 - Aditi Kapoor: Trish, I completely agree with you ‚Äì the principles of Persistence and Resilience from "Think and Grow Rich" are indeed powerful and essential in life's journey. Being persistent, persistently pursuing goals in a determined manner, and showing resilience, the ability to recover quickly from challenges, are key qualities that shape a person's character and contribute to their success. Your example of Sarah Jakes Roberts is truly inspiring, highlighting how these principles can turn adversity into opportunities for growth and positive change. It's a reminder that challenges don't define us; our response to them does. Keep embracing the journey with persistence and resilience ‚Äì it's the path to remarkable achievements!
23/01/24, 15:48 - Trish EWYL23E1035: ü§óTrue
23/01/24, 15:49 - Aditi Kapoor: Great, so let's begin the session with your updates on the projects.
