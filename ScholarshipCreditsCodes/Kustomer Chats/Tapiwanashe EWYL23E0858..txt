25/11/23, 17:44 - Tapiwanashe EWYL23E0858.: Firstly the spirit of competition is a driving force in all our activities concerning personal growth and business growth.  Competition allows people to achieve targets and goals because as you compete you will achieve many things.if some one wants to be a top achiever in class , one must compete with the best students.  For you to be competitive you must grow your self, invest a lot in knowledge,  have discipline and manage your time. For example Cristiano Ronaldo is a good competitor to Messi because he practices a lot and he has became a great person reaching  milestone record . So competition is a key in growing businesses and careers
25/11/23, 22:19 - Aditi Kapoor: Absolutely! Your insights on the spirit of competition being a driving force for personal and business growth are spot on. Competition indeed serves as a catalyst for individuals to reach and surpass their targets and goals.
