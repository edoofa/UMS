I will be sharing my  exam preparation strategies with you today
As an A level student l have a combination of three subjects.
 l have prepared a six hour study time table fitting in all  of my subjects in on different days and a different prescribed number of hours.
So l focus more on the subject that is rather hard for me, l allocate more days to it as well as time to study it. 
I also take past exam paper, to improve my time management skills  and concentration.
Being in a quiet environment  suit for studies is ideal to achieve full results and for the sake of progress
