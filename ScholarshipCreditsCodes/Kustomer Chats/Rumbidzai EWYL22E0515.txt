16/12/22, 19:39 - Rumbidzai EWYL22E0515: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Rumbidzai Mutengwa and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is RumbidzaiEWYL22E0515.

16/12/22, 19:41 - Aditi Kapoor: - That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!

- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.

- How do you intend to broaden this student community? In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.","transform":"

16/12/22, 19:44 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Rumbidzai!
Hope you are well.
Welcome to the EWYL Line.
16/12/22, 19:46 - Rumbidzai EWYL22E0515: I am doing great thank you
Its my pleasure to be on this line
16/12/22, 19:54 - Aditi Kapoor: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction. 
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
16/12/22, 19:54 - Aditi Kapoor: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects that we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and put effort to make it a _learning and earning experience_.
If you are ready then we can begin?
16/12/22, 19:56 - Rumbidzai EWYL22E0515: I am ready
17/12/22, 03:44 - Aditi Kapoor: That's great Rumbidzai!
I am very glad.
17/12/22, 03:45 - Aditi Kapoor: So which project have you chosen to work on for December?
17/12/22, 03:50 - Rumbidzai EWYL22E0515: The second project
17/12/22, 18:20 - Rumbidzai EWYL22E0515: I am a proud Edoofian
17/12/22, 18:21 - Aditi Kapoor: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

Go out with friends to parties, eat with no concern, go to a church or set up Christmas at your home. Have a Christmas and New Year of your desire. Then come back with much more energy as your EWYL team has planned a very fruitful year ahead of you.

Many more projects, more skills to master, more exposure to new companies, more knowledge, and more surprises. :gift-box:

27/12/22, 22:14 - Rumbidzai EWYL22E0515: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on *tution fees*

The final percentage of scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his\/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarship is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship


Be mumaclubs guys it also helps
27/12/22, 22:14 - Rumbidzai EWYL22E0515: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students\/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $200 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their A Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the child would have passed the necessary requirement then in order to complete the enrollment process, the payment of the balance of $150 is to be done. *If the child wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $200 would be refunded back to the parents*

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used to adjust the fee and the balance is to be paid in that case
27/12/22, 22:14 - Rumbidzai EWYL22E0515: Well if you are found eligible for The EDOOFA Scholarship Program, then the Academic Board will be giving you time for 7 days after you receive the Acceptance Letter,to process the payment of your Program Fee which is $200(out of the $350). The remaining $150 can be paid through your Earn While You Learn program, so something which you're getting here is your enrollment fee is only $200.
Most pipo dnt like this part?
27/12/22, 22:14 - Rumbidzai EWYL22E0515: Which simply means, if you are found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship and receives Acceptance Letter from The Academic Board, you will be receiving a time span of 7 days to pay the enrollment of payable amount of $200

This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
27/12/22, 22:14 - Rumbidzai EWYL22E0515: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee. 
Documents like O level results are also needed b4 one is enrolled into e program n due to the pandemic the fee yakadzoswa to 200$ and its best to grab the opportunity b4 the fee ups again to 750$?
