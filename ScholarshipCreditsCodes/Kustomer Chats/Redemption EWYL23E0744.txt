Share your thoughts on your Edoofian Journey in the comments of this post
14/12/23, 15:56 - Redemption EWYL23E0744: Unfortunately i don't have an Instagram account ,but I'll install the app soon
14/12/23, 16:10 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
14/12/23, 16:11 - Redemption EWYL23E0744: Understood
14/12/23, 16:35 - Ananya: Alright, I want to share some amazing news you know, yesterday I was working with my students' credits! It seems like my students are back with so much excitement. I am so happy with their work‚Äîeverybody is so active while working on their projects. Many of my students are earning credits, and I am sure they will return to India with a lot of credits in their accounts!
14/12/23, 16:36 - Redemption EWYL23E0744: That is surely amazing news
14/12/23, 16:44 - Ananya: You know, 2023 is wrapping up. Don't you think we should kick off the new year with something big? How about committing to earning a specific amount of scholarship credits?

After all, you wouldn't want to head to India empty-handed.
I'm saying this from my own experience ‚Äì having some credits before you arrive in India isn't just a benefit for you; it's a help for your parents too. Not only this, we often pick students for internships and personal training based on their credits and regularity in the EWYL journey.

Believe me, you've got plenty of time right now being in your home country, so don;t you think we should utilize this time with our utmost dedication?
14/12/23, 16:50 - Redemption EWYL23E0744: I really think so too that it is right to utilise the time I'm here
14/12/23, 16:54 - Ananya: I've finalized a few students for a 30-day challenge, and I want you to be a part of it. I need you to attend the sessions dedicatedly and put in the hard work for your EWYL projects.

Moreover, I'll set specific targets for you, and I want your commitment to work diligently to achieve them. As your mentor, I'll be there to guide and support you every step of the way. Is that alright with you?
14/12/23, 16:56 - Redemption EWYL23E0744: Yes ,it is really alright with me and I'm really glad with your decision of making me be a part of the students for the challenge
14/12/23, 16:57 - Ananya: Amazing! Let's set a new target for you. For the first 10 days out of the 30, I want you to focus on connecting with two schools and getting eight students to submit their offline application forms.

If you encounter any challenges during this time, reach out to me immediately because we need to achieve this target. I expect you to give it your best effort.
14/12/23, 17:01 - Redemption EWYL23E0744: Well understood, I'll really try my best to reach out to the two schools
14/12/23, 17:18 - Ananya: Well, now that our session time is over, let's connect in our next session on Monday. Before that, I encourage you to work your best to achieve your target. üöÄ

Meanwhile, don't forget to follow your EWYL ritual, as I'll be sharing the Saturday activity with you!

üöÄ Brace yourself for a lesson sprinkled with knowledge and a dash of holiday cheer! üéÑüéÅ

Today's Wednesday Wisdom is not just special but carries a powerful reminder of the true essence of Christmas. As we stand on the brink of the festive season, it's crucial to reflect on the values that unite us as a community.

Beyond the glittering lights and festive decorations, Christmas serves as a poignant reminder of the core values that bind humanity together. It's a time when love, compassion, and generosity take center stage, fostering a sense of togetherness and shared joy.

Let's take a moment today to embrace the spirit of Christmas, appreciating the significance of our connections with one another. The lessons learned during this festive season go beyond the celebration itself, leaving a lasting impact on the way we interact with those around us.

May this Wednesday Wisdom inspire you to carry the spirit of Christmas not just during the holiday season but throughout the year! üéÑ‚ú®

Wishing you a joyous and reflective Wednesday!

Warm regards,
Team EWYL

02/01/24, 15:36 - Redemption EWYL23E0744: Afternoon Ms Ananya 
I wanted to ask that regarding the target you set for me,you said i have to connect with two schools and get eight students to submit their offline application forms right
So my question is that are the eight students supposed to be from the two schools i would have connected with or just any
02/01/24, 19:30 - Ananya: No, Redemption, they can be from any school.
02/01/24, 19:30 - Ananya: I hope you had a fantastic New Year! Because of the holiday break, our Monday session had to be canceled, but don't worry about it. I hope you enjoyed the extra time for celebrations.üåü

To make up for it, let's have a special session tomorrow at 9:30 AM. Get ready to tell me how you celebrated the New Year, and I'll also share my resolution with you. I'm looking forward to catching up with you!üï§
03/01/24, 13:00 - Redemption EWYL23E0744: I am proud of Edoofian
03/01/24, 13:09 - Ananya: Good morning, Redemption! üåû

Let's start the day with a bit of fun and mystery. Here's a riddle for you:

'I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have nobody, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?'
03/01/24, 13:13 - Redemption EWYL23E0744: I think its an echo
03/01/24, 13:14 - Ananya: Great, Redemption! You are right! By the way, how was your new year?
03/01/24, 13:15 - Redemption EWYL23E0744: It was fantastic and how was yours Ms Ananya
03/01/24, 13:23 - Ananya: It was great! Well, I want to gently remind you about the importance of submitting your Saturday activity. It appears that you did not receive your Saturday activity as you did not follow your ritual that day!

I understand that life can get busy, and sometimes deadlines slip our minds. However, let's view this as a fresh start and an opportunity for growth. Instead of scolding, I encourage you to reflect on this as a chance to improve your time management and organizational skills.

Mistakes happen, and what's essential is how we learn and grow from them. If there are any challenges or concerns you're facing, please feel free to discuss them with me. Together, we can work towards a successful and productive year.
03/01/24, 13:26 - Redemption EWYL23E0744: The issue about the Saturday activity had surely slipped from my mind and i sincerely apologise for forgetting Ms Ananya
Thank you for reminding me about it
03/01/24, 13:35 - Ananya: You did not submit your Wednesday lesson response last week. I want to emphasize that we keep a record of your attendance and submissions. You have been doing well; do you wish to see a dip in your progress?
03/01/24, 13:36 - Redemption EWYL23E0744: Yes Ms Ananya i would like to see how i am progressing
03/01/24, 13:49 - Ananya: If you fail to submit your lessons and activity responses on time, you may fall behind in terms of your records.

03/01/24, 13:58 - Ananya: So, Remeption how are you working on your EWYL project target? Are you facing any challenges?

03/01/24, 14:12 - Ananya: Can you please tell me the name of the school?
