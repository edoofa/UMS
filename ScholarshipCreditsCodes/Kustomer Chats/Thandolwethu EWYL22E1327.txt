28/06/23, 14:11 - Ananya: Hello Thandolwethu, Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Line. Here we practice a 'mantra' where you should always start and end the day by saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' to boost your energy!
28/06/23, 14:14 - Ananya: we shall be having our session on Monday and Thursday at 12 PM-2PM so be sure to come on time 5 minutes before and share the mantra “I am a proud Edoofian” to mark your attendance.
28/06/23, 14:14 - Ananya: You will be sharing the Proud Edoofian mantra every day to mark your attendance and when you won't be having your sessions on Tuesday and Friday, you will be receiving a task or interesting story to learn from.
28/06/23, 14:14 - Ananya: And on Wednesdays I will also share the lesson with you so come around 12PM to receive the lesson
Similarly, I will share the Saturday Activity on Saturday so come over around 12PM to receive the same.
28/06/23, 14:14 - Ananya: So from now on it is very important for you to be active in the sessions at the designated times shared with you as it will be a factor to consider your attendance and ultimately for the Edoofa Grant too.
28/06/23, 14:14 - Ananya: Keep a note on the time table as we strictly connect only at 12-2PM just twice a week, and the rest of the days, you have to share the mantra to mark your attendance before 12PM
28/06/23, 15:38 - Thandolwethu EWYL22E1327: Understood

28/06/23, 15:41 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

Team EWYL

Tell us if these were helpful for you in the comments below!
01/07/23, 13:57 - Ananya: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!

20/07/23, 13:47 - Ananya: Good morning Thando! How are you doing today?
20/07/23, 16:03 - Thandolwethu EWYL22E1327: My inspirational business personality is Mr Alton Ndlovu ,a very prominent business man dominating the transport and logistics business in Zimbabwe. He owns huge haulage trucks, shops and markets. Mr Alton Ndlovu comes from a very poor background. He lost both of his parents at a very tender age, and was left at the care of his abusive brother. He only got education up to the level of Grade Seven, and could not go further than that citing financial problems. He then started to be exposed to child labour, as he ventured into being a farm worker, being paid peanuts, and he left that job. He then worked for a business man as a grinding mill operator, where he almost lost his five fingers. He left that job,  began selling tomatoes in a bucket around the famous Sekusile Business Centre in Bulawayo, Nkulumane. Business was good by then, and he could manage to make extra cash for himself without cheating the owner of tomatoes, but upon suspecting that he was still from her, the owner ended their contract. However, Alton had realised how good is vegetable business,and had developed an interest in it ,all these struggles he underwent were a source of strong motivation for him, he strived to change his way of life, he worked hard to get out of poverty. He started his own vegetable business,expanded his operation into South Africa, developed connections and relations with the white man. When the white man saw the passion, dedication and commitment in him ,they trusted him with their trucks, he started using the trucks to transport his vegetables to Zimbabwe for sale, business went well till he managed to buy one of the trucks. As time went by ,he bought more trucks and today he owns more than 20 big trucks, shops and market buildings. Mr Ndlovu values integrity, hardwork, determination and commitment. He believes that in order for one to succeed in life , they need a combination of the above mentioned factors. Now Mr Ndlovu is paying school fees for some students, he paid for mine from form 1 to 4, and helped me for my form 5 first term studies . He has helped other people to start their own businesses too. What we can learn from his story ,a story of poorest guy in the community who has become a business man,is that it doesn't which background you come from , you only need to work hard , be determined, committed and strategic in your approach.
