Let's kick off our session with a fascinating scientific fact:
The Eiffel Tower can actually be 15 cm taller during the summer. This happens because the iron expands in the heat and contracts in the winter, causing the height variation.ðŸ¤¯ðŸ—¼

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.

01/12/23, 15:37 - Ananya: Good morning and happy new month,Gombe! ðŸŒžâœ¨

As we kick off our session today, let's start with a question: What exciting plans do you have for this month? Whether it's academic goals, personal projects, or anything else, I'm here to support you. Let's make December a month of growth and achievement! ðŸš€ðŸ“š
01/12/23, 15:38 - Gombe EWYL23E0849: This month I would like to go to Victoria Falls for a vacation holiday
01/12/23, 15:47 - Ananya: Really? That's so beautiful!
01/12/23, 15:52 - Gombe EWYL23E0849: Thank you
01/12/23, 15:53 - Ananya: So, your weekly lesson was about Unleashing Your Potential Through Input-Output. Tell me if you could understand the significance of inputs and outputs of any task you undertake.
01/12/23, 16:00 - Gombe EWYL23E0849: Yes ma'am it was a bit clear but can you kindly explain further to me
01/12/23, 16:01 - Ananya: Can you please share what didn't you understand?
01/12/23, 16:02 - Gombe EWYL23E0849: The part of the real world application
01/12/23, 16:11 - Ananya: Imagine you're on a quest of learning and growing, much like an exciting adventure in school and life. Now, think of the "art of analyzing" as your superhero power in this journey.
Analyzing means looking at things carefully, like a detective solving a mystery. When we talk about "inputs" and "outputs," we're talking about the stuff you put into something (like time, effort, or resources) and what comes out of it (the results).
So, why is this superhero power so cool? Well, it helps you tackle tasks with a smart plan, learn from what you do, and get even better at it. It's like having a secret tool that guides you to success in everything you do at school and beyond.
01/12/23, 16:12 - Ananya: Picture this: You have a tricky math problem. Analyzing helps you break it down, figure out the steps, and solve it like a math wizard. Or maybe you're working on a project with friends. Analyzing lets you see what everyone is good at, making your team even stronger.
