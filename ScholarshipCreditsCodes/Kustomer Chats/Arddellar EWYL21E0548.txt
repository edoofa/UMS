20/07/22, 20:49 - Unknown: Hello Edoofian! How are you? 

Please send the \"proud Edoofian\" message for the day.
20/07/22, 20:49 - Unknown: I see that you have selected 3 as the option, Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”

Greeting of the day, my proud Edoofian! How are you doing?
21/07/22, 20:43 - Unknown: Arddellar, Did you work on the Wednesday wisdom Edoofian? What are your takeaways from it?
21/07/22, 21:27 - Arddellar EWYL21E0548: From the article ,,i gathered up the issue of responsibility. One has to be responsible for his or her actions and not to blame anyone for any shortcomings incurred. I also picked up the issue of choices . One has to make certain choices in life and this probably will shape your future. 
Another issue was failure, people dont have to blame anyone for their failures but the way forward is to take time for some remorse and try again
21/07/22, 21:52 - Unknown: Good to read your response on this lesson Arddellar! I am glad that you were able to understand the crux of that which is that successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it.
21/07/22, 22:04 - Arddellar EWYL21E0548: Yes sir
21/07/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Do you believe you do the same thing Arddellar?

25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

28/07/22, 18:58 - Arddellar EWYL21E0548: About the wednesday wisdom i learned abot time management.Time management was said to be the ability to use your time productively and efficient.For time management  to be effective we have to combine it with prioritising our time.We also have to be able to differentiate between urgent and important, which is the key to prioritising our time and workload. We can also use the prioritising matrix to be able to arrange our tasks into categories.By using the priority matrix one has to ask himself questions like which of my tasks needs to be done in the next 48 hours

28/07/22, 20:24 - Unknown: \" Don’t worry about failure. Worry about the chances you miss when you don’t even try.\"

28/07/22, 20:25 - Unknown: Really good to receive your work on the Wednesday wisdom. I am sure you enjoyed it and learnt how you should manage your time in order to get the best outcome right?
28/07/22, 21:29 - Arddellar EWYL21E0548: Im good sir how are you
28/07/22, 21:29 - Arddellar EWYL21E0548: Thats right sir
28/07/22, 23:46 - Unknown: Now first step to take positive steps in this direction is via making a schedule for yourself, Right?
28/07/22, 23:51 - Arddellar EWYL21E0548: Yes sir thats right
28/07/22, 23:57 - Unknown: Arddellar, the distinction between urgent and important is the key to prioritizing your time and your workload, whether at work, at home or when studying.
It enables you to work out what to do first, and what can be left either until later, or not done at all. For example, if you leave an urgent but unimportant task, you may find that it becomes unnecessary.
29/07/22, 00:56 - Arddellar EWYL21E0548: Yes sir its all clear
29/07/22, 01:14 - Unknown: So how do you believe you should put in your effort in making a schedule for your work on EWYL projects ?
29/07/22, 02:04 - Arddellar EWYL21E0548: If i can plan which project i should do first then the rest according to their importance and the time that i have
