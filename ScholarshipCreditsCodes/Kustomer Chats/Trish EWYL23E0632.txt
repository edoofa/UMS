I hope you're doing well. Its time for your Saturday Activity, where you are required to submit a short assignment on how your degree, combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI), can be used to make a positive impact on society.

In our recent Wednesday lesson, we explored how the integration of computer science and AI is instrumental in saving lives and improving healthcare outcomes. Now, it's your turn to reflect on how your specific field of study can contribute to the greater good, leveraging the power of AI.ü§ñ

Please consider practical applications, potential challenges, and the ethical implications of your proposed solutions. Your insights will not only deepen your understanding of the subject but also pave the way for meaningful contributions to society.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to reach out.
Looking forward to reading your thoughtful responses!üí°
