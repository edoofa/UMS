06/03/23, 19:40 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!

09/03/23, 22:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Now, It is time to explain with examples How Edoofa is revolutionizing the Education System on the African Continent. Examples create clarity. This is why they are used in all contexts as a tool to provide further understanding.

13/03/23, 21:01 - Wilbert EWYL22E1136: A north star matric is a key performance indicator that represents the most important goal for a business. It drives the company's overall success and serves as a guide for decision  making,  it should  be measurable,  relevant and aligned  with the company 's mission and values.  Business  are able to measure  their performance, like how much profits made,  customers, the cash inflow or out flows,  the budgeting.  All these examples are guided by the north  star  matrics. 
Without  direction  or a vision ,  a business  might fail,  so it is important  to set goals in order to achieve. 

As for me never giving up and consistent hardworking and determination   is my north  star matric. 

In life there is failure , people  fail so many times, even successful  people  once failed but they did not give up. After  not giving  up there is hard working  once you work very hard and focus,  all goals can be achieved..

I believe  that my north star matrics,  will help me in academics and both in life
