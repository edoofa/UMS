12/12/23, 16:49 - Ananya: Mwenje, we only met twice a week, don't you think you could have rescheduled your other work and attended your sessions instead?
12/12/23, 16:51 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: I'm so sorry. I promise I'm going to be early on Friday

13/12/23, 16:04 - Ananya: *Happy Wednesday*üåª

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into ‚Äì the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work ‚Äì a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.üåü

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.ü§ù

Best regards,
Team EWYL

15/12/23, 15:41 - Ananya: Good afternoon, Mwenje!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!
Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!üçìü´ê
15/12/23, 15:42 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: Oh thank you.
15/12/23, 15:42 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: What's today's lesson.
15/12/23, 15:52 - Ananya: To begin with, may I inquire if you had the chance to review your Wednesday lesson?
15/12/23, 15:52 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: Yes I did.
15/12/23, 15:55 - Ananya: That's great! What did you learn from it? I am quite excited to hear your thoughts on the lesson!
15/12/23, 15:56 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: I learnt about the virtues that a student is suppose to uphold and what it takes to be a good student.
15/12/23, 16:07 - Ananya: Can you please elaborate?
15/12/23, 16:10 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: One is suppose to be honest with what they do and also hard working in what they're undertaking for an opportunity like this does not come to everyone. So when one is given an opportunity like this, they are suppose to work hard and prove to the people granting the scholarship that they made the right decision.
15/12/23, 16:14 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
15/12/23, 16:14 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: Okay.
15/12/23, 16:18 - Ananya: To begin with, may I inquire if you had the chance to review your Wednesday lesson?
15/12/23, 16:21 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: I did.
15/12/23, 16:28 - Ananya: That's great! What did you learn from it? I am quite excited to hear your thoughts on the lesson!
15/12/23, 16:29 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: One is suppose to be honest with what they do and also hard working in what they're undertaking for an opportunity like this does not come to everyone. So when one is given an opportunity like this, they are suppose to work hard and prove to the people granting the scholarship that they made the right decision.
15/12/23, 16:43 - Ananya: Absolutely, your summary resonates with my understanding. In the ever-evolving landscape of academia, students encounter numerous challenges, tasks, and responsibilities. Amidst this dynamic journey, two crucial virtues come to the forefront: hard work and honesty.
15/12/23, 16:45 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: Thank you.
15/12/23, 16:49 - Ananya: So, Mwenje, I believe we should start with something that aligns with your interests. Can I know which one is your favorite project, the community building, or the school connect?
15/12/23, 16:51 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: The school connect.
15/12/23, 17:02 - Ananya: Well, that's great! By the way, I understand that we couldn't have a fruitful session today, but I would still suggest working hard on your projects by utilizing the weekends. Set a small target for yourself, like 3-4 forms over the weekend, and work hard to achieve it.

Remember, I am saying this with experience; the credits you can earn now will be helpful throughout your journey, and for that, I am determined to keep your spirits high and push you to the fullest! Now, let's connect on Tuesday. Meanwhile, do not forget to follow your EWYL ritual daily to receive the activity.

19/12/23, 15:43 - Ananya: Good day, Mwenje! üéÑ‚òÄÔ∏è

Did you know that the tradition of hanging stockings by the fireplace comes from the legend of St. Nicholas? According to the story, St. Nicholas dropped gold coins down the chimney of a poor man's house, and they landed in the stockings that were hanging by the fire to dry. From then on, the tradition stuck, and now many of us hang stockings as part of our Christmas celebrations. üß¶‚ú®

Now that we've kicked off with a festive fun fact, how can I assist you in today's session? üòäüéÅ
19/12/23, 15:45 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: I'm sorry to take you back, I was wondering if you could please elaborate on how I should carry out the projects in order for me to earn my student creditsüòÅ.
19/12/23, 15:55 - Ananya: Alright, so let us begin with the second project!

19/12/23, 16:00 - Ananya: Are you done with the audio?
19/12/23, 16:01 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: Yes I'm done.
19/12/23, 16:02 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: I'm sorry for not sending in the details of the students. I shall be working on that from today onwards. Where am I supposed to send their details?
19/12/23, 16:17 - Ananya: Well, Mwenje, please understand that you are undertaking these projects for your own credits, so there is no need to be apologetic. Instead, ask me how you can truly excel in these projects! Trust me; I say this from experience‚Äîthe credits you earn now will benefit you greatly when you are here in India. It's like saving for your future.
19/12/23, 16:18 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: What about the third project
19/12/23, 16:18 - Ananya: .
19/12/23, 16:22 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: Thanks for the help.

22/12/23, 15:37 - Ananya: Good morning, mwenje!

Let us begin our today's session with a small joke!üéÑüßëüèΩ‚ÄçüéÑüåü

What do you call Santa when he takes a break? 

Santa Pause! üéÖ‚è∏Ô∏è
22/12/23, 15:37 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: What's for today üòÅ
22/12/23, 15:48 - Ananya: Mwenje, why didn't you follow your EWYL ritual?
22/12/23, 15:50 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: It must have slipped my mind. I apologize üòî.
22/12/23, 15:53 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: I also did no have internet bundles
22/12/23, 15:59 - Ananya: Mwenje, please understand that we must follow our EWYL rituals daily, to receive our lessons and activities.
22/12/23, 16:07 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: I will.
22/12/23, 16:15 - Ananya: Now, 2023 is wrapping up. Don't you think we should kick off the new year with something big? How about committing to earning a specific amount of scholarship credits?
After all, you wouldn't want to head to India empty-handed.

I'm saying this from my own experience ‚Äì having some credits before you arrive in India isn't just a benefit for you; it's a help for your parents too. Not only this, we often pick students for internships and personal training based on their credits and regularity in the EWYL journey.
Believe me, you've got plenty of time right now being in your home country, so don;t you think we should utilise this time with our utmost dedication?
22/12/23, 16:31 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: Yes I will commit myself to carrying out the activities to earn myself student credits.
22/12/23, 16:35 - Ananya: Great, so I have finalized a few of my students for a 30-day challenge. During this duration I want you to dedicatedly attend the sessions and work hard on your EWYL Projects.
Not only this, I will set a target for you and you have to commit to work hard to achieve those targets. Being your mentor I will be there to help you in each process. I that alright?
22/12/23, 16:44 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: Yes it's okay.
22/12/23, 16:46 - Ananya: Amazing! Let's set a new target for you. For the first 10 days out of the 30, I want you to focus on connecting with two schools and getting eight students to submit their offline application forms.

If you encounter any challenges during this time, reach out to me immediately because we need to achieve this target. I expect you to give it your best effort.
22/12/23, 16:48 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: Okay I will.
22/12/23, 16:49 - Ananya: Alright, your time starts now! Start exploring and working so that you can submit at least 2 application forms with me by tomorrow! Utilize the weekend. Now, let us conclude our session here, and we shall reconnect on Tuesday. Make sure to follow your EWYL ritual tomorrow, as I will be sharing your weekend activity.
22/12/23, 16:56 - Mwenje EWYL23E0694: Okay.
