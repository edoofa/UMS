19/07/22, 04:04 - Rutendo EWYL22E0220: In Zimbabwe there are natural resources which become goods and raw materials and these increase economic development and industrial growth. For the natural resources to be used the government made policies towards the use of raw materials and it is trying to have a stable currency which is needed for capital. Labor supply in Zimbabwe is high but there are less jobs or employment available for the citizens. Technology is improving since Zimbabwe gained its independence and the President of Zimbabweade a plan called the 2030 vision which sees the country developed and economically stable. Technology is making jobs easier, faster and better which is leading to an increase in a business's output and an increase in profits. Infrastructure is being improved especially the roads which are under renovations for the industry sector to have better transportation. Trucks with refrigerators are being used to transport perishables from the industries to the markets or being exported. Introduction of Rural growth points in Zimbabwe has made some industries to relocate and create markets for other industries too and the informal sector is slowly improving the industrial sector. The main industries in Zimbabwe are mining, farming, sugarcane, tea, tobacco and cotton production. This is improving day by day but there are always challenges which are economic and political which can affect the industry sector. Zimbabwe's government is trying to develop a a stable currency but its failing and this is affecting industrial development. I can predict that if the currency doesn't get stable within the next 7 to 10 years Zimbabwe's economy will have fallen drastically.

23/07/22, 20:33 - Unknown: Sat Activity:Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
This week, we discovered that people who are successful don't hold the world responsible for their failures. They accept accountability for their own choices and results. To develop this mindset of taking responsibility for everything and avoiding the blame game takes time and focus. As your Saturday Assignment your are required to write a short write up, on the growth mindset of successful people and how will you make sure you develop the same mindset. The word limit for this assignment is 150-200 words. Kindly make sure you follow the word limit strictly, any responses less than the minimum word limit will not be marked.
You are required to submit the same by Monday 10 AM  on the dedicated EWYL line.

Happy learning !

23/07/22, 20:51 - Rutendo EWYL22E0220: I would wake up early in the morning and pray to God for everything. Clean my room as always and then greet everyone in the house. I will go out for a walk exploring my neighborhood. I then come back and bath and also read my  books for 2 hours, after that I go out to meet with my friends and as a teenager we move around doing mostly what makes us happy and at lunch we mostly go to our house and have lunch. After lunch we talk about our lives and how we can improve it mostly in the park. At around 3pm we go to the soccer academy and play there. I'm the vice captain and it really makes me feel happy and boosts my confidence around people. After playing soccer, we then escort each other home and then I have a bath and eat and then go to sleep
23/07/22, 20:53 - Unknown: Do not forget to send *I am a proud edoofian* even on Sunday.
23/07/22, 20:54 - Unknown: Great, also I would like you to know , a successful day for me is when *I am able to contribute to the learnings of my students and inspire you.*

To use my learnings and experience to contribute to your career growth.
23/07/22, 20:58 - Rutendo EWYL22E0220: Okay ma'am I won't forget
23/07/22, 20:58 - Rutendo EWYL22E0220: Wow that's really great, you are really a hardworking person ??
23/07/22, 21:09 - Rutendo EWYL22E0220: People with great and successful mindsets do not have a  fixed mindset but have an abundance mentality. They don't fear failure and are always motivating themselves to keep pushing and never give up even if they fail,to keep pushing through  the pain.\"No pain no gain\" everything needs focus and also to be responsible for what ever that happens. Create a long term vision instead of only creating short term goals. Learn to listen to your gut and keep believing that you can do it even if the odds are not on your side. For me to be successful and have a great mindset I will develop a simple morning routine that I will follow to improve my discipline and I will always remind myself of my successes whenever I fail so that I can have hope and aspirations. I will try to put myself in new challenging situations and always think of failure as a learning opportunity and as my mentor. I will always be persistent and just never give up on whatever I do even if it's in academics I will try my best and prove to everyone especially my edoofa family that I can do everything through christ who strengthens me.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

15/07/23, 13:21 - Rutendo EWYL22E0220: Good morning ma'am, today I'm going to talk about the Econet wireless founder Strive Masiyiwa. He was born on January 29, 1961, in Zimbabwe, and was raised in Zambia, where his father worked as a miner.

After completing his education in Scotland, Masiyiwa returned to Zimbabwe in the early 1980s and began working for the state-owned telephone company, the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC). In 1986, he left the PTC to start his own engineering firm, which provided services to the telecom industry.

In 1993, Masiyiwa founded Econet Wireless, which became the first privately-owned mobile network operator in Zimbabwe. The company faced several challenges in its early years, including legal battles with the government, which was opposed to the idea of a privately-owned telecom company. However, Masiyiwa persisted, and his company eventually became a major player in the African telecom industry.

Over the years, Econet Wireless has expanded beyond Zimbabwe and now has operations in several other African countries, including South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, and Burundi. The company has also diversified into other industries, including financial services, renewable energy, and media.

Masiyiwa is known for his philanthropic work, particularly in the areas of education and healthcare. In 1996, he founded the Capernaum Trust, which provides scholarships to orphaned and underprivileged children in Zimbabwe. He has also been involved in several initiatives aimed at improving healthcare in Africa, including the establishment of the Higherlife Foundation, which supports healthcare programs in Zimbabwe and other African countries.

In addition to his business and philanthropic work, Masiyiwa is also a prominent advocate for democracy and good governance in Africa. He has spoken out against corruption and has been involved in several initiatives aimed at promoting transparency and accountability in African governments.

  

Overall, Strive Masiyiwa is a highly successful entrepreneur and philanthropist who has made significant contribution in Africa. Strive Masiyiwa is an inspirational person to me because of the works he did for the Zimbabwean community. His determination for success made him be respected in all of Africa, to be honest most of the people would have given up when he was having legal battles with the government and had a lot of challenges in the first years but that didn't bring him down, he found new ways for his company to succeed and that to me is having heart, being passionate and disciplined and knowing what the goals are.


All of these entrepreneurs have one thing in common, they are all determined even if they face many hardships they just see those obstacles as steps to success

20/07/23, 12:50 - Rutendo EWYL22E0220: Good morning ma'am
20/07/23, 12:50 - Rutendo EWYL22E0220: I have read the Wednesday wisdom and I've noticed some ideas I never thought of like being kind to others, being helpful nowadays as young adults to be a leader you must be aggressive, everyone must be afraid of you that way no one is going to disrespect you or do anything stupid that was what I thought was being a leader because that's what I only see in today's leaders but after reading the Wednesday wisd I've realized being is the opposite of what I thought a leader

Leading by example, being a listening leader, being diverse and not making someone think they are not part of the community or that they are useless

I've learnt a lot and I thank you for the lesson
20/07/23, 12:57 - Tenzin: Greetings! How are you today?
20/07/23, 13:02 - Rutendo EWYL22E0220: I'm doing great, Ma'am and you?

20/07/23, 13:08 - Tenzin: Please spare me a few minutes to go through the lesson you shared. In the meantime please update me on the progress of your projects.
20/07/23, 13:11 - Tenzin: I completely agree and appreciate your perspective. It's wonderful to hear that you've read Wednesday's Wisdom and have found some new ideas that challenge your previous notions about leadership. Kindness and helpfulness are indeed essential qualities of a leader, and they can have a profound impact on those around you.
Leadership doesn't necessarily mean being aggressive or making others afraid of you. True leadership is about inspiring and empowering others, fostering a positive and supportive environment, and leading by example.
20/07/23, 13:19 - Rutendo EWYL22E0220: It's okay
20/07/23, 13:20 - Tenzin: Rutendo, Please update me on the progress of projects.
