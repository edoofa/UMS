13/02/23, 16:48 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, Let me share a small story with you!                                                                                                                                                                                       Ready??                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

Now, Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

And in a very similar manner, you can repeat the same process with the Form 5 students as well.
04/03/23, 22:11 - Vinah EWYL22E0844: Following
04/03/23, 22:13 - Jasmine Kaur: *Things to be on a look out for:*

1] ADMIN ACCESS:
04/03/23, 22:13 - Jasmine Kaur: It is very important that we add the right Student (Applicant) to the group, so please make sure that you YOURSELF add the participants and don’t forward the link of your group blindly. 
It is done so that:
04/03/23, 22:13 - Jasmine Kaur: 1) We have the right student, by the right student we mean that the groups should have students who are really serious and passionate about their higher education and want to use the scholarship as a stepping stone in their career.
04/03/23, 22:13 - Jasmine Kaur: 2) We have the students who are known to you and or your friends who you feel that after your initial interaction with them are equally passionate like you to follow your footsteps and build your network. The other benefit being it will directly impact your scholarship credits.

06/03/23, 15:40 - Jasmine Kaur: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”
