20/05/23, 12:05 - Felix EWYL22E0953: I am a proud Edoofian
20/05/23, 12:05 - Ananya: `- That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!`

`- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.``- How do you intend to broaden this student community?

20/05/23, 12:07 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Okay I‚Äôll do so I‚Äôve been told that my session‚Äôs at 11:30

20/05/23, 14:26 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Okay
20/05/23, 15:12 - Ananya: Now,Today we're going to talk about how to find student-centric SMEs in Africa using Google and LinkedIn. Are you familiar with these tools?
20/05/23, 15:14 - Felix EWYL22E0953: I‚Äôm a proud Edoofian
20/05/23, 15:14 - Ananya: `- That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!`

`- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.``- How do you intend to broaden this student community? 

In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.
20/05/23, 15:15 - Felix EWYL22E0953: SMEs??
20/05/23, 15:15 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Alright
20/05/23, 15:17 - Ananya: SMEs are small medium enterprises. For project one, we need to connect to some companies to build cooperative alliance, so I am helping you with that.
20/05/23, 15:35 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Oh yah it‚Äôs the same SME I was thinking about
20/05/23, 15:44 - Ananya: So, Are you familiar with these tools?
20/05/23, 16:17 - Felix EWYL22E0953: I‚Äôm familiar with google and LinkedIn but not the SMEs
20/05/23, 16:24 - Ananya: I understand, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are businesses that occupy a significant position in the economy. These enterprises typically have fewer employees and generate lower revenue compared to large corporations. SMEs play a vital role in driving innovation, creating job opportunities, and contributing to economic growth. They are known for their flexibility, adaptability, and entrepreneurial spirit. SMEs can be found in various sectors, including manufacturing, services, technology, and more.
20/05/23, 16:36 - Ananya: Congratulations on completing today's session! ILet's keep that momentum going and look forward to our next session on Friday during your reserved slot. I'm excited to see what more we can accomplish together!
20/05/23, 17:00 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Ohh I now understand
20/05/23, 17:00 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Thank you
22/05/23, 21:04 - Felix EWYL22E0953: I‚Äôm a proud Edoofian
22/05/23, 21:04 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Alex who loved playing the piano. Despite facing financial hardships, he practiced on an old, worn-out piano every day. His passion and dedication led him to enter a prestigious music competition.

What did Alex's passion and dedication lead him to?
a) Winning a sports competition
b) Receiving an art scholarship
c) Participating in a theater production
d) Entering a prestigious music competition
24/05/23, 17:18 - Felix EWYL22E0953: I‚Äôm a proud Edoofian
24/05/23, 17:18 - Ananya: Hello everyone! Our latest post on the Edoofa Instagram page is something you definitely wouldn't want to miss. Please visit our page to take a look and feel free to share your own opinions in the comments section.

24/05/23, 17:19 - Felix EWYL22E0953: d) Entering a prestigious music competition
24/05/23, 17:19 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Alright I‚Äôll do so
24/05/23, 17:20 - Felix EWYL22E0953: I already shared this
24/05/23, 18:16 - Ananya: I would like to inform you that these are automated messages that you receive. Automated text messaging is one of the easiest ways to stay connected with our large student community and acts as an affirmation of our identity as proud Edoofian. Isn‚Äôt it?
24/05/23, 18:18 - Ananya: You would also agree that time is important to everyone, and we realised that close to 70% of discussions had fallouts due to slow responses. Since I have more than 100 students who I am mentoring at the moment, I like to be personally invested in each one‚Äôs growth. I was facing a challenge in addressing each and everyone timely. But I wanted to make sure at least each one receive a reiteration of our proud identity from my end as well. Therefore, It was strategically decided to use technology to help us in maintaining our sense of community, keeping our spirits high, and also ensuring I have a maximum time in my day to focus on your skill development and sessions. So we thought of using technology for assistance and hence the idea of using automated responses.
24/05/23, 19:20 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Yes I understand and it helps a lot
24/05/23, 19:23 - Felix EWYL22E0953: It‚Äôs a very good idea
25/05/23, 17:33 - Ananya: Greetings, Felix!
25/05/23, 18:26 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Hello how are you?
25/05/23, 18:26 - Ananya: On this Africa Day, I would like to extend my heartfelt wishes to you. As students, you are the future leaders, innovators, and change-makers who will shape Africa's destiny.üåü

On this special day, let us take a moment to reflect on the achievements and progress that Africa has made, while also acknowledging the challenges that lie ahead. Africa is a land of incredible beauty, resilience, and untapped potential. As students, you have the power to unlock that potential and make a positive impact on your communities, your countries, and the entire continent.‚ú®
25/05/23, 18:30 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Thank you I appreciateüôèüèΩ
25/05/23, 18:31 - Ananya: So,what are your plans for celebrating Africa day today?
25/05/23, 18:52 - Ananya: Felix,I want to emphasize the significance of this session so that you fully understand its importance. I have set aside this specific time slot exclusively for you. It is crucial that you are attentive and responsive during our discussion. Quick and timely replies are essential because if we are not able to communicate efficiently, it may hinder our progress and potentially lead to delays in completing our projects on time.
25/05/23, 19:01 - Ananya: I feel a sense of disappointment regarding today's session, and I have certain expectations for our next session. While I understand that you may have encountered some challenges or issues, I kindly request that you make a sincere effort to be punctual in our future sessions. The next session is going to be a video session on Saturday. I will share the link shorty!
26/05/23, 17:47 - Felix EWYL22E0953: I‚Äôm sore for the late replies it was African freedom day so a lot of things were happening here
26/05/23, 17:47 - Felix EWYL22E0953: *sorry
29/05/23, 17:52 - Felix EWYL22E0953: I‚Äôm a proud Edoofian
29/05/23, 17:52 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
29/05/23, 17:53 - Ananya: Dear, may I ask why are you late again?
29/05/23, 17:55 - Felix EWYL22E0953: I was washing my shoes and clothes since I‚Äôm preparing to go and get my passport tomorrow I‚Äôm getting it from another town
29/05/23, 17:56 - Felix EWYL22E0953: That‚Äôs where the passport office is
29/05/23, 17:59 - Felix EWYL22E0953: When I get here what do I copy to paste in Linkedln?
29/05/23, 18:01 - Ananya: I understand Felix, however you need to understand that these sessions are equally important dear.
29/05/23, 18:02 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Yes I do understand and again I was told that I need to gather all requirements so I try my best to balance up the time
29/05/23, 18:04 - Ananya: That is alright, I understand.
29/05/23, 18:04 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Thank you
29/05/23, 18:05 - Felix EWYL22E0953: And I need help on the company thing here
29/05/23, 18:05 - Felix EWYL22E0953: 
29/05/23, 18:07 - Ananya: You can now search for the same company on LinkedIn to extract out the information or the company detail form.
29/05/23, 18:09 - Felix EWYL22E0953: So this one right?
29/05/23, 18:09 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Then after that I try contacting the director?
29/05/23, 18:10 - Ananya: No, you do not have to contact anybody, you just have to fill in the company detail form.
29/05/23, 18:11 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Then I send it to you right
29/05/23, 18:12 - Ananya: Absolutely, however Felix! I believe you were not attentive during the session because this company was just an example, and you have to search for companies other than this.
29/05/23, 18:13 - Felix EWYL22E0953: And you didn‚Äôt send the company detail form I just have the student form and school form
29/05/23, 18:13 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Yes I was just asking to clarify I‚Äôll obviously search for other companies
29/05/23, 18:18 - Felix EWYL22E0953: And is it just limited on African companies or maybe even outside Africa?
29/05/23, 18:18 - Ananya: During your initial sessions, I have shared the form with you, however let me share it again.
29/05/23, 18:19 - Ananya: *Company Details for Project 1*

29/05/23, 18:20 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Thank you
29/05/23, 18:21 - Ananya: No, you have to search within Africa only,
29/05/23, 18:21 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Alright
29/05/23, 18:22 - Felix EWYL22E0953: So here meaning I have to talk to the contract person before giving you the company details right?
29/05/23, 18:25 - Ananya: Dear, you do not have to contact anybody. You just have to search for the companies and their details. Our team will connect to the concerned person.
29/05/23, 19:04 - Ananya: Since, your session time is over now, we shall connect in our next session to discuss our projects.
05/06/23, 17:39 - Felix EWYL22E0953: I‚Äôm a proud Edoofian
05/06/23, 17:39 - Ananya:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, Let me share a small story with you!
 Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came. 
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.
The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell: 

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. 
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above  
05/06/23, 17:42 - Ananya: So, Felix! How have you been?
05/06/23, 17:43 - Felix EWYL22E0953: 1. Hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting challenges
05/06/23, 17:43 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Good thanks madam and yourself?
05/06/23, 17:44 - Ananya: Absolutely! When we approach challenges with a strong work ethic and unwavering determination, we have the power to overcome even the most formidable obstacles. Hard work fuels our progress, while determination provides the mental strength and resilience needed to push through difficulties. Together, they create a potent combination that empowers us to conquer challenges and achieve remarkable outcomes.
05/06/23, 17:46 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Yes I understand
05/06/23, 17:47 - Ananya: So, may I ask if you were able to search for the companies?
05/06/23, 17:49 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Yes but it was a bit challenging cause I didn‚Äôt have any connection so now I started diversifying my account and at least I‚Äôm being connected to some people
05/06/23, 17:50 - Ananya: May I know if you were there in the last video session?
05/06/23, 17:52 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Yes I was that‚Äôs when you taught us how to connect to people on Linkedln so I‚Äôve been doing that
05/06/23, 17:52 - Felix EWYL22E0953: And I‚Äôve sent emails to some schools I‚Äôm just waiting for their responses
05/06/23, 17:53 - Ananya: Excellent! In the meantime, you can start by identifying the companies that align with our guidelines, and once that is done, you can proceed with searching for the right individuals within those companies.
05/06/23, 17:57 - Felix EWYL22E0953: So I just identify educational companies then once you verify them we proceed that‚Äôs what you mean right?
05/06/23, 18:01 - Ananya: I mean that you can just finalize a few companies while you are trying to expand your network on LinkedIn. You can save you time by this.
05/06/23, 18:07 - Felix EWYL22E0953: Oh alright I understand
