These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

06/03/23, 22:21 - Tenzin: Let us start our Today’s session with this motivational quote:
“You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think.” — A.A Milne
06/03/23, 22:23 - Tinashe EWYL22E0704: Very well
06/03/23, 22:24 - Tinashe EWYL22E0704: Wonderful
06/03/23, 22:26 - Tenzin: Tinashe, I hope that we can start from this point?
STEP 2: We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.
06/03/23, 22:29 - Tinashe EWYL22E0704: Noted
06/03/23, 22:32 - Tenzin: The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counselling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counselling session thereafter.
06/03/23, 22:33 - Tinashe EWYL22E0704: Following.
06/03/23, 22:39 - Tenzin: As for attracting the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our Juniors who are in Form 5, and Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
06/03/23, 22:40 - Tenzin: Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
06/03/23, 22:42 - Tinashe EWYL22E0704: Noted
06/03/23, 22:44 - Tenzin: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to STUDY IN INDIA with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
06/03/23, 22:46 - Tinashe EWYL22E0704: I will do so if l get an active group
06/03/23, 22:52 - Tenzin: Yes
Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

And in a very similar manner, you can repeat the same process with the Form 5 students as well.

06/03/23, 22:55 - Tenzin: *Things to be on a look out for:*

1] ADMIN ACCESS:
06/03/23, 22:55 - Tenzin: It is very important that we add the right Student (Applicant) to the group, so please make sure that you YOURSELF add the participants and don’t forward the link of your group blindly. 
It is done so that:
06/03/23, 22:55 - Tenzin: 1) We have the right student, by the right student we mean that the groups should have students who are really serious and passionate about their higher education and want to use the scholarship as a stepping stone in their career.
06/03/23, 22:55 - Tenzin: 2) We have the students who are known to you and or your friends who you feel that after your initial interaction with them are equally passionate like you to follow your footsteps and build your network. The other benefit being it will directly impact your scholarship credits.
06/03/23, 22:56 - Tinashe EWYL22E0704: I am following
06/03/23, 22:57 - Tenzin: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community building project, YOU ADD ME and make me the ADMIN of the Group.
Add my number 
06/03/23, 22:57 - Tenzin: The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
06/03/23, 22:59 - Tinashe EWYL22E0704: Failed to add you since you are using a business account
07/03/23, 18:33 - Tenzin: Greetings, Edoofian
I hope that you are doing well
07/03/23, 18:33 - Tenzin: Please add this number:
+7696398732
07/03/23, 18:33 - Tenzin: Edoofian, It is important that we finish our conversation regarding the Community Building Project because we are lacking behind other students

08/03/23, 01:59 - Tenzin: We can connect now, Tinashe
