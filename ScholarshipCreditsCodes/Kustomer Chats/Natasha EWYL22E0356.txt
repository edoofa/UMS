21/07/22, 23:40 - Natasha EWYL22E0356: Greetings Ms Riva.
22/07/22, 16:51 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr
22/07/22, 18:34 - Natasha EWYL22E0356: Olk ma'am thank you for the fruitful information.
22/07/22, 19:12 - Unknown: Today I wanted to discuss the recent message I shared with you. The message that we want to be our daily habit, our words of connecting and experiencing a sense of belonging, We all at team Edoofa are very thrilled as we personally are undertaking the same activity. May I know what have you understood from this message, what is the intention behind the same?
22/07/22, 20:21 - Natasha EWYL22E0356: I have understand that  the Edoofa program and every other program in it serves to bring people who are part and parcel of it together trough working hard leaving us contented. It also serves to impower and equip the Edoofians to be determined and focused. 'I  am a proud Edoofian'is a statement that reminds every Edoofian of their aims.
22/07/22, 20:23 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

25/07/22, 19:45 - Natasha EWYL22E0356: A mind set defines each and every one of us. It is basically how we view everything around us, and it affects our lives in so many ways. Having the right mindset makes a difference between success and failure. Success in in almost every area of life can be influenced by how we think about  our talents and abilities. The most desired mindset for one one to be successful is the growth mindset. It is based on the idea that essential qualities are things we can cultivate through our efforts. Everyone can change and grow through experience and practice. The growth mindset of successful people allow them to   see failure not as a detriment but rather a springboard to success. To them, failing is actually learning. Knowing they are responsible for their growth, successful people tend to ask for and value feedback as they are interested in developing and challenging themselves. They are not afraid of criticism or judgment. A particular set of habits and an increased appetite for risk is the particular and profoundly powerful mindset that successful people have. Successful people tend to focus on growth, solving problems and self improvement. They believe that with efforts and perseverance they can excited and their intellect, broaden their skills, improve their character as well as overcome obstacles.

I will like to add to this Actions that are based on the principles of Oneness are rewarding in the sense that they fill us with happiness and joy, whether or not you get your desired results. Just the act of committing to the effort makes us feel connected to everything and can help heal isolation, loneliness, and helplessness.
