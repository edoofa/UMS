So may I have an update on your projects, please?
04/09/23, 16:02 - Rutendo EWYL22E0390: I am following up the school head from where I was learning for the details.
04/09/23, 16:12 - Aditi Kapoor: Alright, so may I know a bit about the conversation.
04/09/23, 16:24 - Rutendo EWYL22E0390: *School Details*:

1. School Name: Mambo High School
2. School Province: Midlands Province
3. Name of the contact person: Mavuka Henry
4. Designation of the contact person: Head
5. Whatsapp Number:+263712790393
6. Year of the establishment of the School: 1952
7. Pass% of A level (Last Academic year): 85%
8. No. of teachers in School: 45
9. The number of students in A level: 52
10. Fees structure in A level (Per Term in USD): $70
11. Date of Call: 07/09/2023
12. Time of the scheduled meeting (CAT):1500



*Details submitted by*:
1. Full Name: Takawira Locadia Rutendo
2. EWYL Group Name: Rutendo EWYL22E0390
3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
I learnt at that school that's how I get to know about it. We discussed about the benefits of the program and how to inquire into it. We discussed also about the qualities of the students.
04/09/23, 16:24 - Aditi Kapoor: When the school‚Äôs per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
04/09/23, 16:36 - Rutendo EWYL22E0390: OK it's well noted, let me do so
04/09/23, 16:38 - Aditi Kapoor: Great!
