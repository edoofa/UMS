I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into ‚Äì the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work ‚Äì a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.üåü

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.ü§ù

14/12/23, 18:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Good afternoon Munashe,
How are you?

Let's begin with our session.
Can you share your response to the Wednesday lesson that I shared with you yesterday?
14/12/23, 18:42 - Munashe EWYL23E0226: One should have an honesty characteristic. Most students lack this important skill in life especially when in college. If one doesn't have honesty it results in improper behaviors such as copying others work or plagiarism. But if one is committed to their work it brings out pride in them and maybe able to help their peers.

One should also be hardworking and committed to their hard work
14/12/23, 18:42 - Munashe EWYL23E0226: So far the project is showing progress as people are sending me their application forms.
I can't be sure of how many application forms l may submit but l will submit once l get them
14/12/23, 18:43 - Munashe EWYL23E0226: Ms Saloni lately l haven't been feeling well so l went to the pharmacy and the pills l am taking make me dose most of the time . I apology.
14/12/23, 19:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Absolutely, honesty is a crucial characteristic, particularly in college, where it often shapes ethical behavior. Students lacking honesty may resort to plagiarism or copying others' work. Commitment to one's work not only instills pride but also fosters a supportive environment where hardworking individuals can positively influence their peers. Therefore, a combination of honesty and commitment to hard work is vital for personal growth and a thriving academic community. Appreciate your emphasis on these values.
14/12/23, 19:04 - Saloni Rastogi: I am sharing some videos with you in the EWYL Group, I am sure it will really help once you will them yourself.
14/12/23, 19:07 - Munashe EWYL23E0226: Noted Ms Salo
14/12/23, 20:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Certainly! We'll conclude the session here. Unfortunately, I won't be available tomorrow due to personal commitments. However, I trust you'll continue the daily ritual of affirming 'I am a proud Edoofian.' Looking forward to your participation in the upcoming Saturday activity. If there's anything you need in the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day!

28/06/23, 15:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

28/06/23, 15:45 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know Munashe which Project will you work on in this month?
28/06/23, 18:54 - Munashe EWYL23E0226: Alex 's story is an inspiration one as he embarks on a new journey to success. Through reading the book's concept of identifying based habits, he was able to to change his behavior to into the one he envisioned which is studying, learning and and embrace all challenges without fear. Success comes from what we envision our selfs to be and change our habits to match it. Furthermore Alex managed to encourage his classmates to adopt to a positive way of studying and learning through the book's knowledge, he managed to convince a bunch of his friends as he led by example through his school results that were coming out positive. This shows we should not think for ourselves only but instead try to share the knowledge we have with others and through that your journey to success becomes easy. Alex found the book by chance but he grabbed the opportunity and transformed many lives in the process.

Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self‚Äîthe person you aspire to be‚Äîand consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!
