20/10/22, 18:05 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Wednesday Lesson

Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian,

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Deadline: Saturday 9 AM
Happy Learning.
10/11/22, 18:15 - Unknown: Also, I hope that you are aware that we have our scheduled session tomorrow.

I am a Proud Edoofian by the name BLESSING ETHEL WACHENUKA 

I would like to present as well as sharing my understanding on the Wednesday wisdom lesson with you.
The main topic of the lesson was about skills in other words we are talking about the qualifications or qualities one has to be able to handle what ever given or comes their way .
The first skills is of what we experience in our daily lives and how it is guiding us in what we are doing , along with experience one surely has a lesson to tell in order for that to be seen as an experience and these  things are not included in our syllabus.

I also leant that one should develop useful skills in order for them to discover their true selves as well as becoming more creative.
The most important part of these skills is that it also aids us or guide our journey of becoming prosperous professional .
The lesson was mainly bringing out the subject matter which is discussing about the underrated and underappreciated skills which are required in the workplace, especially those for young professionals who are really looking and seriously focusing on their careers and goals of becoming successful.
In other words it is what is also known as self awareness  

So this guidede me in discovering some of the strength I should or I have 
1. Firstly there is strength seen in the knowledge which one has on what they are doing .
2 . Ability to scale sustainably
3.customer services in preparation for how we would work with people .

Characteristics I have or I should have I think the one of silence just like Mr Barack Obama has as he is my aspiration 
1. That of human competencies 
2. Process capabilities
3. Financial resources being able to handle that in business  
4 . Having customer care this is the most important thing one should have in business and with this it will also guide one in being successful because we do not know who will help us in our journey and which way a

23/07/22, 04:41 - Blessing EWYL21E0898: Greetings to you all  . Proud Edoofian here
I would like to take my time with you guys discussing the main or key takeaways . From the lesson I have noticed that for one to have a crucial character that makes one to master the right attitude that is needed in people's lives and plays an essential role in one becoming successful . As the sea one should be wise and clever as the sea has been described. So a person  should attract people even enemies but in the end you turn out at the top . Enemies of progress should feel the pinch when you become successful. The takeaways I got are . Firstly I am the sea and I am as lovely as you see me now 
Secondly as the sailor noticed the cruel wind caused the wreck \"the sailor could not say anything except fell sorry for blaming the sea 3 The failures in life are mostly caused by the people you won't suspect. If one is to achieve something he or she should get to work, be positive, stay focused and if you don't like what you see in the mirror don't blame the mirror. Successful people accept responsibility for their destiny and losers blame others for not being successful

23/07/22, 04:42 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

23/07/22, 20:43 - Unknown: Good Morning, Proud Edoofian ?
I hope that you are doing well
23/07/22, 20:43 - Unknown: I am very glad to see your submission.
If you have to point out one major learning from this lesson.
May I know what it would be?
23/07/22, 22:24 - Blessing EWYL21E0898: I have learnt that for one to master the right attitude , he or she must be able to face the short comings and not blame others for their failure. Also don't be quick to judge
25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

I am a proud Edoofian by the name Blessing wachenuka 

I would like to present to you my write up on the growth mindset of successful people and how we will also develop the same mindset .
To begin with According to my research and the knowledge I have acquired from successful people the likes of doctor Ola Brown etc firstly one should start by discovering his or her vision which will lead her to being successful. One has to struggle for what they want in life not to wait for some or if someone gives up you also give up and later blame them for your failures .  The mindset must  be focused every time successful people are always ready to solve any situation that comes their way because they are always business minded and sometimes they don't need a plan to do something successful .
We should be wise and clever enough just like a sea and be cool . They attract people even enermies to make them have a mind that  you aren't progressing and later turn out at the upper class so that they can feel the pinch when you become successful.one should always be lovely. Never trust anybody to the fullest because they close ones are those who will be praying for your down fall . To achieve a lot in life you should always be positive all times , work hard and never blame other people if things don't work out because successful people don't blame anyone for losing rather they find another solution

I hope that you are in good health and spirits ✨

In the past couple of days, You might have noticed that I was not very active on the EWYL DEDICATED LINE.

Team edoofa has arranged a webinar  for you all, 
The webinar would be taken by Ronard Kachage.
Designation  founder at Success Magazine.

Date  August 
Time  IST 

Takeaways from the webinar.
The topic will be along the lines of how Mr. Kachaje went on to pursue a career in real estate by having a degree in the same field and eventually figured out his calling which was building the media brand  Magazine. One of the many benefits of starting a business or pursuing your passions when one is a bit older is that they bring all of the experience and wisdom to the table. 
The journey of Mr. Kachaje is certainly inspiring, growth-oriented, and a wonderful example for the youth of today, not only in terms of being passionate about what you believe in but also having a consistent outlook towards learning on the way and figuring things out at the same time. 

Please fill the RSVP form  the RSVP Form: https:\/\/forms.gle\/NnZ5v4tj2tbkroKQ8
