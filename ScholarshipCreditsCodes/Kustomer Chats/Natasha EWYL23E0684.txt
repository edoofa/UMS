12/10/23, 13:06 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.
12/10/23, 13:07 - Natasha EWYL23E0684: Alright thank you
12/10/23, 13:19 - Ananya: You know, I came across a video that my professor shared when I was a student, during our examinations. While thinking about your session this morning, it occurred to me that I should share this with my students as well
12/10/23, 13:20 - Natasha EWYL23E0684: Alright you may go aheadüå∏
12/10/23, 13:22 - Ananya: https://youtu.be/-RZ86OB9hw4?si=67Pz56KNwC7OFkEe
12/10/23, 13:23 - Natasha EWYL23E0684: Ooh ok l will download it at school using WiFi now l'm at home,thank you
12/10/23, 13:24 - Ananya: Natasha, I believe we should start with something that aligns with your interests. So, may I ask which EWYL project is your favorite?
12/10/23, 13:30 - Natasha EWYL23E0684: There is this project you said l should hit school principals or headmasters,l don't know if we can make it because in Zimbabwe we have national examinations swhich started on 9 otober,so we can choose either that one of companies
12/10/23, 13:31 - Natasha EWYL23E0684: If it's good with you
12/10/23, 13:38 - Ananya: I understand that exams are currently taking place. However, I've noticed that the heads are responding to my other students. So let us give it a try, no?
12/10/23, 13:39 - Natasha EWYL23E0684: Kay so we can give it a try then
12/10/23, 13:40 - Natasha EWYL23E0684: It's alright
12/10/23, 13:40 - Ananya: Absolutely! Did you share that message with the deputy head?
12/10/23, 13:41 - Natasha EWYL23E0684: No Let me do it right
12/10/23, 13:48 - Ananya: Once you get a response from the school head about their available time, do let me know so that I can share some valuable resources with you.
12/10/23, 14:07 - Natasha EWYL23E0684: Okay thank you
12/10/23, 14:15 - Ananya: Now, may I ask if you have created a group for the community-building project?
12/10/23, 14:19 - Natasha EWYL23E0684: No ,l'm failing to create it
12/10/23, 14:21 - Ananya: What kind of challenges are you facing,  Natasha?
12/10/23, 14:23 - Natasha EWYL23E0684: Not that much,l haven't created it before
12/10/23, 14:23 - Natasha EWYL23E0684: In the group,l will add the school head and Edoofa team or?
12/10/23, 14:26 - Ananya: No, Natasha, you should add the students who are interested in studying in India to the group. This way, you can share your experience with them on a single platform instead of communicating with multiple students individually.
12/10/23, 14:27 - Natasha EWYL23E0684: Ooh okay l was confused
12/10/23, 14:27 - Natasha EWYL23E0684: Thank you

12/10/23, 16:02 - Ananya: I'm happy to help you with that. Have you discussed this with your admissions team? They should have the contact information for students at the university you're interested in.
12/10/23, 16:03 - Natasha EWYL23E0684: Okay,l haven't
12/10/23, 16:10 - Ananya: I would suggest you do that, as they will be able to help you out.

15/11/23, 16:19 - Natasha EWYL23E0684: Hello
15/11/23, 16:30 - Ananya: I noticed that you haven't been attending your sessions lately, and I haven't received any communication about it. Is everything alright on your end, or is there something I can help with?
15/11/23, 16:45 - Ananya: I was expecting a response from your end, however since our session time is over, I am concluding today's session here. I am sharing your Wednesday lesson, which features an incredibly inspiring story of Alex. I would appreciate it if you could share your views on Alex's journey with me by tomorrow positively.
15/11/23, 16:45 - Ananya: Happy Wednesday! üåü
Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

18/11/23, 16:17 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
