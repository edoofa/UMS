21/09/23, 15:48 - Hasting EWYL23E0519: Greetings, Ms. Saloni,I am Hasting and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Hasting EWYL23E0519.
21/09/23, 15:55 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Hasting!
How are you doing?
21/09/23, 15:57 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
21/09/23, 15:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - “I am a proud Edoofian”
21/09/23, 15:57 - Saloni Rastogi: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter

3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
21/09/23, 15:58 - Saloni Rastogi: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *09:30-11:00 AM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
21/09/23, 15:58 - Saloni Rastogi: If you are ready then we can begin🎉
21/09/23, 16:04 - Hasting EWYL23E0519: Yes
21/09/23, 16:10 - Saloni Rastogi: This is great!
21/09/23, 16:11 - Saloni Rastogi: I am sharing this week's Wednesday lesson with you. Make sure you work on it and share your response with me done you are done reading it.
21/09/23, 16:11 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofians, Hope you are doing well!

Let's join the session on the *EWYL Line* and discuss the same along with progress on projects.
25/09/23, 13:14 - Hasting EWYL23E0519: Handling tasks with minimum or no supervision is one of my strength.
25/09/23, 13:19 - Saloni Rastogi: That is great, so what kind of tasks are you good in handling?
25/09/23, 13:20 - Hasting EWYL23E0519: Tasks related to academics.
25/09/23, 13:25 - Saloni Rastogi: That is awesome, I am so glad to hear that!
25/09/23, 13:25 - Hasting EWYL23E0519: Thanks
25/09/23, 13:26 - Saloni Rastogi: So Hasting, may I know on which project will you like to work in the coming weeks with all your focus?
25/09/23, 13:30 - Hasting EWYL23E0519: The first one "Corporate Alliances"
25/09/23, 13:37 - Saloni Rastogi: 🍃UPDATE
Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for the time being. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.

In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
25/09/23, 13:37 - Saloni Rastogi: Can we focus on the second project for till that time?
25/09/23, 13:38 - Hasting EWYL23E0519: Yes
25/09/23, 13:40 - Saloni Rastogi: So Hasting, did you form the WhatsApp group that we last discussed ?
25/09/23, 13:59 - Hasting EWYL23E0519: Not yet.
25/09/23, 14:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you form one group today and add all you classmates?
25/09/23, 14:02 - Hasting EWYL23E0519: Yes please
25/09/23, 14:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Okay, once you form the group, do add me as well.

Also, you have the resources that you need to share with the students once they all get added in the group?
25/09/23, 14:10 - Hasting EWYL23E0519: Yes ma'am
25/09/23, 14:14 - Saloni Rastogi: That is great, have you started making the group?
25/09/23, 14:33 - Saloni Rastogi: I hope our session was helpful, and you feel more confident about your freelancing journey. Before we wrap up, here's a lesser-known fact: Freelancers often overlook the importance of networking and building relationships. Building a strong professional network can lead to consistent clients and valuable referrals. So, remember to invest time in networking as it can be just as essential as your skills and portfolio.
25/09/23, 14:34 - Saloni Rastogi: att
25/09/23, 14:37 - Hasting EWYL23E0519: Yes, my school mates  applied already but I am still trying to find out from others.

28/09/23, 13:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Hasting!
I hope you're doing well. I wanted to bring to your attention that there was a slight oversight in the document shared yesterday. It appears to be the same as the one from the previous Wednesday. To ensure we're on the right track, I've attached the correct PDF for your review. Your insights and feedback are highly valued, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this updated material. 💥
28/09/23, 13:16 - Saloni Rastogi: .
28/09/23, 13:47 - Hasting EWYL23E0519: The importance of time management. 

1. Maximizing productivity; when you manage your time you can do more work in less time.
2. Poor time management; this leads to procrastination which causes unnecessary stress and anxiety.
3. Achieving goals; when you allocate your time wisely you can truly focus only on things that matters. 

 Managing time during exam season. 

Create a study schedule. 
Time management is an indispensable skill that can impact one's academic success, especially during exams. By managing time you can practice self-care, prioritize tasks and stay organized. With these strategies in place you be well equipped to excel in your exams and maintain a balanced life throughout your academic journey.
28/09/23, 14:01 - Saloni Rastogi: Certainly!
Time management is paramount for various reasons. It enhances productivity by allowing you to accomplish more in less time, reduces stress by curbing procrastination, and aids in achieving your goals by focusing on what truly matters. During exam season, a well-structured study schedule is essential to success, helping you balance academic responsibilities and self-care, ultimately leading to a more harmonious academic journey.
Here's a fascinating fact: Research has shown that only about 17% of people can accurately estimate the passage of time without relying on external aids like clocks and timers. This highlights the importance of honing effective time management skills to make the most of each day.
28/09/23, 14:03 - Hasting EWYL23E0519: Thanks.
28/09/23, 14:04 - Saloni Rastogi: So before moving ahead, I am think that working on projects will get very easy once you will answer these question.

05/10/23, 13:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Today, we're discussing the *importance of belonging to a community in our journey towards success.*

Belonging to a community, whether it's a family, a social group, or a professional network, can be incredibly motivating. It gives us a sense of purpose and a desire to contribute and be recognized. Communities provide a support system that helps us overcome obstacles, and they are rich sources of knowledge and expertise.

As we explore the significance of belongingness, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic and any project updates you might have. Please share your views and updates here.
05/10/23, 13:31 - Hasting EWYL23E0519: Belonging to a community is very important because it motivates and inspires you to work extra hard and strive for success.
  A Community keeps someone moving towards their goals, when you are faced with challenges a community is there to offer support. 
  Being part of something bigger than oneself, an individual can achieve their goals more effectively and experience a deeper and feel meaningful sense of success.
05/10/23, 13:34 - Hasting EWYL23E0519: I communicated with my former school and they told me to connect with them next week, that's when they are going to be free.
05/10/23, 13:40 - Saloni Rastogi: Your response beautifully captures the essence of belonging to a community. It's indeed a powerful source of motivation, support, and a pathway to meaningful success. Did you know that studies have shown that individuals who belong to a community tend to be not only happier but also healthier? The sense of connection and shared purpose can lead to reduced stress and improved overall well-being, making it even more essential to be part of a community on the journey to success. 🌟🤝
05/10/23, 13:42 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a great news, Hasting!

May I know if you have:
1. Resources to be shared with the heads?
2. Contacts of other school heads
