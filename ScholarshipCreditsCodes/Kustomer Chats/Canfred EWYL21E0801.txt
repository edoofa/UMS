14/07/22, 21:28 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

I want to connect today and finish our session, Let us discuss this week's lesson and activities, Projects and Progress, and Plan for next week. Below are the timings of today's session.

25/07/22, 03:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:34 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

Problem-solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem-solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals toward achieving this goal. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem-solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

I would appreciate you sharing your learnings from today’s lesson. 

Happy learning!
11/01/23, 22:14 - Saloni Rastogi: You have not submitted your last week's lesson and activities understanding with me on the EWYL Line nor have you shared your updates on the projects. May I know if you are facing any challenges?

From my understanding you have to simplify situations by attacking the big problems first and then simplify them. The other part of problem solving is having Numerical fluency , this part pf life you have to be well versed with the scientific staff in order to change into the practical life of it and according to charlie without Numerical fluency you are like a one legged man.the Third Strategy is that you have to invert , Inverting will not necessarily mean that you can solve the problem but helps you not to get into the trouble and Charlie called it the the problem filter which i found funny and intresting?.the other thing is that you have to study the basics , understanding the basics is something that keeps on coming up and moreover to me it was the best problem solving strategy i liked.

How are you doing?

Problem-solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem-solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals toward achieving this goal.

So can you please share what are your views on:
1) Wednesday lesson
2) progress on the projects
13/01/23, 20:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, I have seen his application and shared it with the counselors as well, they will get in touch with him.
13/01/23, 20:45 - Canfred EWYL21E0801: Always proud to be an Edoofian
13/01/23, 20:46 - Saloni Rastogi: I can very well relate to what you said about the 5 problem-solving strategies proposed by Charlie Munger.
I related most to the line, “Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Systematically you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. Nevertheless, you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts. Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day – if you live long enough – most people get what they deserve.”
