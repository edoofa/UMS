I am Nyasha Muhoma a proud Edoofian, I'd like to express my gratitude to the Edoofa and it's board for it's long and big palm on how it is transforming my life from the time I became part of it and also some people around myself. For the time before I got to know Edoofa I was so desperate that how can I conquer the mountains to go for  better higher tertiary education, but then God intervened and lead me to  the good life of being an Edoofian. So I am greatly appreciating Edoofa for it's help to lift me from the zero leading me to be a hero. Edoofa has helped me through opening up a chance for me to earn my scholarship credits through the EWYL project which is on board now doing the community building and Africa school reform program at hand and the corporate alliance as well to be conducted soon. Am also appreciating all the motivational I get from the team Edoofa and also greatly appreciating Mr Engad Singh for stretching his hand helping students like myself and all the services he's rendering me are very perfect in any way and they're moulding me in being a a better person with knowledge,good attitude, skills and power to be myself. I'd also like to thank the Edoofa team for it's assistance and patience to help me wherever I go offside. Am being so grateful to appreciate Edoofa because am looking the stage where I am now and where I was before and alone I could not do it but with Edoofa everything is becoming easy. And so I've learnt to appreciate everything you get in life nomatter how big or how small it will yield a lot of things and open more doors in life. 

Thank You Edoofa And Your Team, Continue Doing A Great Thing And Stay Blessed üôè

Hope you are doing well, I would like to announce that tomorrow is a holiday on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan which is an auspicious Indian Festival so I am sharing the lesson with you today!

So for this week's Wednesday lesson,  I have an exciting topic to delve into: Hidden Talent.
We'll dive into the captivating story of Samuel, a character whose seemingly ordinary life takes a fascinating turn when his secret talent comes to light. Through his story, we'll discover the power of talents that lie beneath the surface, waiting for the perfect moment to shine.
So, bring your curiosity and imagination as we delve into Samuel's tale and discuss the significance of hidden talents in our own lives. You might even find yourself reflecting on your own unique abilities that are yet to be revealed.

In our upcoming session I would like to know if you have a hidden talent that you're particularly good at or passionate about? It could be anything ‚Äì from artistic pursuits to something more unexpected.

Get ready to be inspired, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together!
