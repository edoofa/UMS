Let's concentrate this week on working for the true star, which is you. Yes, I'm referring to establishing YOU as a brand. Well don’t be confused, today’s lesson is talking about Personal Brand Building. Listen to the Voice note by Ms Davi and then read the PDF very carefully. You can find some of the ingredients for your success if you attentively read the PDF.

Share with me your key takeaways after reading the lesson!
19/08/22, 22:17 - Panashe EWYL22E0474: The lesson was all about the personal branding,actually personal brand is way that people could easily identify you, what actually you would like to do, your goals and the one's mission in professional world.

A personal brand is very important because it is  representation of you for that others presented with when they look for online. You aresupposed to make a profile that is searchable on social media platforms because some employers and recruiters are using Internet to conduct employment backgrounds searches and for them in order to gauge the idea of character and interests of their potential employees.

A personal brand should be constructed so that it will made it clear in an online environment. For one to create a personal brand, the one has to figure out what the one would like to do and what  attributes and you have to  make sure that you have created a profile that reflects your passion on social networking platforms.
19/08/22, 23:53 - Tenzin: Amazing to read your response and work around personal branding. Your personal brand is  is a representation of you that others are presented with when they look for you online, as well as the image that you choose to project in face to face interactions.
19/08/22, 23:53 - Tenzin: All of our activities online be it on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter or other social media platforms, form an online personal profile that is searchable. And today, *employers and recruiters* are using the internet to conduct employment background searches, and to gauge an idea of the character and interests of their potential employees. So you see, having an acclaimed personal brand is critical in helping you find bigger and better opportunities?
20/08/22, 00:04 - Panashe EWYL22E0474: Well understanding sir.
20/08/22, 00:58 - Tenzin: Now Panashe, the best way to go about it is via following the steps that Ms Davi shared:

1. Figure out what you’re passionate about
2. Grow your social footprint: Via various social media and blogs

I will have a thorough discussion in our forthcoming session about what you think were the factors that led to the success of the three panelists listed here after you have carefully listened to the audio file and read the PDF.

Happy learning!
