Ready for today’s Wednesday Wisdom?

Have you ever wondered what the one governing principle that governs all businesses might be? What is the name of the one value that every company considers to be crucial? Have you ever heard of something called the North Star Metric?

North Star Metric is a key business metric that reflects the core value a product delivers to its customers. It's a single, actionable metric that aligns all efforts towards achieving long-term growth. Let us learn about in greater detail, read the lesson carefully and we will connect in our upcoming scheduled session. 

Till then Happy learning!

12/03/23, 18:24 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well

The feedback we have received from some of you on this week’s Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.
As part of this week’s Saturday Activity, you are required to share your written submission on : 
What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?
There is no word limit, so feel free to express your understanding in detail. The second answer requires some mental work, so sit with yourself, introspect, and share your honest answer with your mentor. 
Let this activity play an important role in your personal goal setting. We will connect soon in our upcoming session. 
Till then, happy learning and happy growing!

28/03/23, 21:51 - Unathi EWYL22E1261: Yes ma’am
28/03/23, 21:52 - Aditi Kapoor: Let me check
28/03/23, 21:52 - Unathi EWYL22E1261: On that other account I think there is a miss connection cause I received a Wednesday wisdom on Friday
28/03/23, 21:52 - Aditi Kapoor: You came on the EWYL Line last on 18th March and today it's 28th March
28/03/23, 21:53 - Aditi Kapoor: I think there is some confusion dear. You have to come to the EWYL Line every day and say that *I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN*. 
By this, we keep the track of the students who are participating in our sessions and activities. 
Most of the information is given to only those students who are coming to the EWYL LIne every day. 

I will share your activity now but make sure to come here every day
28/03/23, 21:55 - Unathi EWYL22E1261: Ohk I understand

28/03/23, 21:57 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay
28/03/23, 21:58 - Aditi Kapoor: Now Unathi, I have noticed that you are a very regular and good student but you are not actively participating in the projects. 
Are you facing any difficulty dear?
28/03/23, 21:58 - Unathi EWYL22E1261: Yes ma’am so I guess that where the whole confusion was
28/03/23, 21:59 - Aditi Kapoor: I am glad that we are sorted now.
28/03/23, 21:59 - Unathi EWYL22E1261: As for last week yeah 
I had problem with my SIM card it could catch any network 
I couldn’t even call 
I ended up doing a sim swap
28/03/23, 22:00 - Unathi EWYL22E1261: Yah we are
28/03/23, 22:05 - Aditi Kapoor: So, what about before last week,

29/03/23, 00:49 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, if that can help you Unathi then you can surely move ahead.
29/03/23, 00:50 - Aditi Kapoor: I apologize for the inconvenience in our session today. There was a unplanned meeting that came up and it can’t be put on hold. I hope you will corporate and understand. 
There is one more announcement that I would like to make. 
Rephrase. I need to tell this to my students. 
*NOTICE  I will be away for the remainder of the week as I will be visiting our students who are currently studying at Indian Universities.*
In order to assess your commitment and enthusiasm toward pursuing a scholarship opportunity in India, I would like to assign you a task. You are free to choose any project or projects of your liking and are requested to complete and submit 10 forms by the end of this week.
I believe this task will provide us with valuable insights into your dedication to your academic pursuits and your desire to earn scholarship credits for future education in India.
All the best and have a great day ahead.
29/03/23, 00:54 - Aditi Kapoor: I hope we are on the same page on this Unathi.
