15/12/22, 06:34 - Saloni Rastogi: Christmas is celebrated by people all across the world, whether they are Christians or non-Christians. Christmas is the perfect time when friends and families come together, spreading joy and happiness. You must be aware of the concept of \"SECRET SANTA,\" but do you know who he or she was, or how the lovely process of sharing joy began? In today's Wednesday Wisdom, let's find out more about secret Santa. Secret Santa has a special message for you at the end. We'll get in touch and discuss your takeaways in more detail.

Happy learning and smiling!

15/12/22, 18:12 - Takunda EWYL22E0524: From the Wednesday Wisdom lesson I understood that a Secret Santa is  a person who demonstrates kindness to people while hiding his true identity. There are no special requirements of an individual to become a Secret Santa, Anyone who is willing to show kindness and come to peoples rescue when they are in trouble or need support can become one .A good example is  highlighted in the document when Cookie handed a 20 dollar note to Larry who was not able to afford a hot meal and cater for his gas tank to drive to town. When things were flowing well on  Larry's side, he had to withdraw one third of his salary to demonstrate the same kindness he had witnessed when he was in need of support.

I would like to give Tendai a brand new mobile phone.The purpose is to thank him for the support he has been giving me and not giving up on me .He has never used a mobile phone for a long time ,with this gift he will be happy.

The other reason is to help him stay updated about the things that are happening all over the world as he is a person who is more it that.He enjoys researching a lot therefore giving him this gift will impart a positive change in his life thus helping him broaden his knowledge and skills.

He also likes playing eduction quiz on the phone ,with the gift he will be very pleased.Since a mobile phone allows easy communication between people ,he will now be able to communicate effectively and efficiently.

22/12/22, 17:43 - Takunda EWYL22E0524: The most memorable part of my Christmas was last year 2021.My brother and I was given an opportunity to go for shopping.We bought everything that we have ever dreamt of having.After the long day shopping ,we went out for a long drive with our friends spending some time together before we returned home.

When we returned home ,we observed that a lot of our relatives had visited .They have us lots of gifts that when I think about them I begin to smile. That night we began lighting some fireworks with our friends,it was a great experience.


Our tradition of celebrating Christmas starts with a short church service and children will be dressed in their special outfits.After the service the family members gather and have a celebration and a feast.The main houses that guests arrive in will be well decorated along with the Christmas tree.People will be dancing to music records.
23/12/22, 01:11 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings my proud edoofian!
Hope you are doing well.

I know I have been quite inactive with our interactions in the past week. With the new year coming, the whole team has gathered together to discuss some new year resolutions and opportunities that we can bring for you so that you grow tremendously. I want to assure you that I am always here for you and am always working hard along with you so that we make up the best team.

I hope you understand it.
23/12/22, 01:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, since I have students who are going to school and many Indian students are also occupied with their classes and exams, I wanted to give all my students some flexibility so that they have their sessions with me and I am there to address all their concerns.
