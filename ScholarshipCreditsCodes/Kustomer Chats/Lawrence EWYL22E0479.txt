15/11/22, 00:14 - Unknown: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

As I believe, the more you know yourself, the clearer your vision of the world and your mind gets. You were given a link to a personality test, which you must have taken up this week, and are all ready to share your response via a screenshot with me in your session. 

Link to the Test: -
https:\/\/my-personality-test.com\/true-colours
15/11/22, 00:14 - Unknown: In our session:
1) we will discuss the personality mark you received

And yes, I have chosen my Edoofian of the week for the last week (07-12) of November and it is Mihlayonke Ndlovu. We will be having a live conversation on his journey so far and yes, this video will be streamed on the YouTube channel of Edoofa and will be viewed by 5-10 thousand students and parents. 
I hope you are ready to be featured in my next Edoofian of the week video (for this week).
For that, we have to work hard and be consistent.
15/11/22, 00:42 - Lawrence EWYL22E0479: Hello ma'am sorry I didn't have time to do the personality test there's a network breakdown due to the lightning which struck our boosters so I'm not able to use the internet in a stable condition, but I am going to try by all means...
15/11/22, 19:09 - Unknown: Good morning Lawrence!
How are you?
15/11/22, 19:09 - Unknown: I can completely understand that Lawrence.
15/11/22, 19:10 - Unknown: Can you use some one else's device for performing the test?
15/11/22, 19:12 - Unknown: Also Lawrence, I would like to inform you about something.
This November, I want that all the opportunities that I have like:
- *Edoofian of the week*
- *Projects other than our three ongoing ones*
- *Webinars*

to go to only those students who are responsible and serious about their sessions.
In case, I had to remind you more than once a week to follow the daily ritual, not only I would be taken aback to share these amazing opportunities with you but also all these interesting and learning lessons and activities will be stopped.
Make sure that from today onwards you follow the daily ritual and share your responses with me timely.
15/11/22, 19:12 - Unknown: Also for the month of *NOVEMBER*, I want that you put your focus on any one project, out of
1) Corporate Alliance\/Company Connect
2) Community Building
3) African School Reform 

Choose any *ONE*, and then we will put all our focus on it.
I want that this NOVEMBER, you earn and aim for LOTS OF SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS.
15/11/22, 19:34 - Lawrence EWYL22E0479: Okay ma'am I can completely understand that I will try my best

16/11/22, 21:08 - Unknown: For today, make sure that you:
1) choose one project for the month of November.
2) share your weekend activity response results
16/11/22, 21:08 - Unknown: Hello, my dear proud Edoofian. I hope all is well with you.

Another insightful Wednesday Wisdom is presented here. The lesson today teaches us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, disability. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition. A few questions near the end of the session will ask you to reflect and have an open dialogue with yourself. After you finish your lesson, as your mentor, I'd like to have a thorough conversation about your key take aways, in our upcoming sessions.

Enjoy the article and keep in mind that success does not come to you suddenly; rather, it can be attained over time by making modest, daily improvements.

Happy learning!

How are you?

The Wednesday lesson taught us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, _disability_. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition.

In our session, we will discuss:
1) your understanding of how disability is different from what we thought about it earlier
2) progress on the projects
3) pending responses to the weekend activity

Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

Hope you are well.

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift or an expensive one. More often than not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them.

In this session on the *EWYL Line*, we will talk about who would you want to be your secret Santa and why?
Please excuse me for yesterday, I was with Ms. Deepali for an important meeting.
20/12/22, 23:24 - Unknown: Along with this, since I have students who are going to school and many Indian students are also occupied with their classes and exams, I wanted to give all my students some flexibility so that they have their sessions with me and I am there to address all their concerns.
So, your batch is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from 11:30 AM-02:30 PM.

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
