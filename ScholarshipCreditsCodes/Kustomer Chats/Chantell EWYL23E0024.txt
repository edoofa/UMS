I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.

16/06/23, 17:45 - Chantell EWYL23E0024: Am ok mam but am a little  challenged this side
16/06/23, 17:46 - Ananya: What happened Chantell?
16/06/23, 17:54 - Chantell EWYL23E0024: 
16/06/23, 17:57 - Chantell EWYL23E0024: So maam...after all am feeling uncomfortable as there is much delay and this week had given myself time to do this and it seems no results so far that i had given you mam
16/06/23, 18:05 - Ananya: Chantell, that's alright. You shouldn't feel uncomfortable at all. I know you've been trying, and together we will figure out the solution to this problem. So, never hesitate to reach out for any problems you are facing.
16/06/23, 18:14 - Chantell EWYL23E0024: it's ok mam.....thank you 
My parents were even in the same state as they expect me to do it the right way.
16/06/23, 18:23 - Ananya: No, I can see that you are trying, and trust me you are quite closer. You have the contacts however the contact persons are quite busy. What you can do you can wait for the exams to be over and meanwhile, search for other schools. After the exams are over you can go back and connect.
16/06/23, 18:25 - Chantell EWYL23E0024: Fine ma'am and i really do appreciate that ma'am
16/06/23, 18:29 - Ananya: Till then let us talk about the community building project, shall we?
16/06/23, 18:30 - Chantell EWYL23E0024: it's ok we can
16/06/23, 18:32 - Ananya: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
16/06/23, 18:41 - Chantell EWYL23E0024: Ok
16/06/23, 18:42 - Ananya: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: Youâ€™re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
16/06/23, 18:44 - Ananya: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
16/06/23, 18:45 - Ananya: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
16/06/23, 18:45 - Ananya: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
16/06/23, 18:45 - Ananya: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
16/06/23, 18:46 - Ananya: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
16/06/23, 19:03 - Chantell EWYL23E0024: 
16/06/23, 19:47 - Ananya: Great, now we shall connect in our next session where I will be sharing a trick for this project. Happy weekend!
16/06/23, 20:02 - Chantell EWYL23E0024: Thanks....a great weekend tooâœ¨
