30/01/23, 20:59 - Aditi Kapoor: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

30/01/23, 21:21 - Aditi Kapoor: As discussed before, In Today’s session, We will be discussing *How we can improve our performance on the African School Education Reform Mission Project*.

Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located?
30/01/23, 21:25 - Tino EWYL22E0829: 1)Kundayi high school , not yet .
2)I will introduce myself and share with them my journey so far with edoofa including my future aspirations
3)mashonaland central
30/01/23, 21:57 - Aditi Kapoor: Proud Edoofian, This week, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
30/01/23, 21:57 - Aditi Kapoor: May I know if you have Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead tomorrow.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him\/her for your School Head’s Contact.
30/01/23, 23:31 - Tino EWYL22E0829: Okay sir
30/01/23, 23:31 - Tino EWYL22E0829: Okay l will send today
31/01/23, 00:11 - Aditi Kapoor: Awesome!
31/01/23, 00:13 - Tino EWYL22E0829: This is the deputy headmaster number
31/01/23, 00:14 - Aditi Kapoor: Great!!
31/01/23, 00:14 - Aditi Kapoor: Now, Once you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering professional communication, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized. 
The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
31/01/23, 00:14 - Aditi Kapoor: So, This is what the First message should look like:
31/01/23, 00:14 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Mr.\/Mrs *School Head Name*

I am *Your Name* and I am a student of _School Name_ school.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result\/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

01/02/23, 19:42 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

Happy Learning!
01/02/23, 20:31 - Tino EWYL22E0829: Thank you
01/02/23, 20:31 - Tino EWYL22E0829: I am a proud aedoofian
02/02/23, 01:18 - Aditi Kapoor: I hope the wednesday wisdom is fruitful for you and we shall be discussing about the same in the next session.
