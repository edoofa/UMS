I like to ponder a lot, and with it comes brainstorming, prototyping, and ideation techniques. How does the idea of meeting a CEO, knowing about their journey, and contemplating how success came to them sound? Interesting, right? Not yet?

Then perhaps you would like to know about how brands are developed, how they scale, how they flourish, and what goes into making a company from scratch to something of impeccable scale. In this webinar not only business ideations and strategies will be discussed but also brand development, moreover, our featured industry professional is profound in advertising, content marketing, and marketing research too. Who knows, something might catch your eye or let you discover your field of interest by just listening to the different structures of a company. I would genuinely implore you to give this a chance and see for yourself whether the seats we worth taking.

17/12/22, 20:14 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!
18/12/22, 03:57 - Kirsty EWYL22E0824: My secret Santa for this festive season is going to be my mother. I'm going to buy her gumboots. My mother loves gardening so much. I want her to wear those gumboots whenever she's at our farm or in our little garden at home.  I want her to feel loved and appreciated each and every second she's wearing those boots. It's a little appreciation of love that am offering. My heart alone can never express how much she mean to me this season, so am buying something for her to show her that she means a lot. Also, am going to make a homemade picture frame of her on her graduation day. She recently graduated with a masters degree but she couldn't attend her graduation ceremony because she had to sacrifice for my enrollment fee for edoofa. The frame is to show her how much of a heroine she is to me and how much l appreciate every single and big thing she does for me and my siblings. For me to be a typical hardworker and woman of faith,she's the reason behind. The reason why l chose my mother to be my secret santa these season is because she's that one person who made me feel whole again this year when l thought of giving up on everything l was working on . She helped me stand on my toes and move again

There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

The inner sense of captaincy is a vital component of leadership that gives individuals the confidence and determination to make a positive impact. It involves having a deep understanding of oneself, embracing weaknesses, and having a positive growth-oriented mindset. Developing an inner sense of captaincy can help individuals navigate challenges, inspire and motivate others, and tap into their full potential as leaders. In today’s Wednesday wisdom, we will explore the importance of this aspect of leadership. 

We will discuss your key learnings in our upcoming session!

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!","transform":"
