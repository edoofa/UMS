07/12/23, 13:47 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, so you shall reach out to those who have joined the group, right?

07/12/23, 14:01 - Sithabiso EWYL23E0320: Yes ma'am can you please resend the resource please
07/12/23, 14:05 - Aditi Kapoor: Sure!
07/12/23, 14:06 - Aditi Kapoor: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.
07/12/23, 14:06 - Aditi Kapoor: Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5‚ÄôS of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
07/12/23, 14:06 - Aditi Kapoor: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

Hope you are well.

14/09/23, 16:51 - Sithabiso EWYL23E0320: Good afternoon ma'am.  I hope you are  well 
I apologize for not being able to attend my sessions. I am preparing for final exams my schedule is too tight but I will try my best. During school time like now it's difficult to run sometimes teachers go beyond lecture time.
14/09/23, 16:52 - Aditi Kapoor: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
14/09/23, 16:52 - Aditi Kapoor: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:


Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and aditii.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com
14/09/23, 16:52 - Aditi Kapoor: Once done, please let me know.
14/09/23, 16:53 - Sithabiso EWYL23E0320: Thank you ma'am
14/09/23, 16:53 - Sithabiso EWYL23E0320: Noted
14/09/23, 16:54 - Aditi Kapoor: You're welcome!
15/09/23, 18:52 - Sithabiso EWYL23E0320: Good afternoon ma'am I have sent the emails
16/09/23, 15:29 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, please share the screenshot with me on the EWYL Group.
16/09/23, 15:29 - Aditi Kapoor: Dear Edoofians,
