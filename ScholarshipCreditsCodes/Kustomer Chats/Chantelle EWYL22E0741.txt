17/01/23, 18:36 - Chantelle EWYL22E0741: Greetings Ms Saloni. I am Chantelle and I'm here to resume my EWYL discussion
17/01/23, 19:09 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Chantelle!
How are you?
17/01/23, 19:10 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
17/01/23, 19:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
17/01/23, 19:11 - Saloni Rastogi: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
17/01/23, 19:11 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
17/01/23, 19:13 - Chantelle EWYL22E0741: Ms Saloni,I can not be available around those times. I can only either be available for an hour during work hours or anytime after 4pm
17/01/23, 19:29 - Chantelle EWYL22E0741: I unfortunately have to go back to work now
Hope you have a good day
17/01/23, 22:35 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know where are you working and what are your available time?
18/01/23, 01:35 - Chantelle EWYL22E0741: Im working at Disa Medinotec. We get 30 minutes breakfast time and 30 minutes lunch time. I'd asked to put mine together so that I can have 1hour and have our sessions from 09:30 to 10:30. If you don't mind,we can continue with those times
18/01/23, 18:54 - Chantelle EWYL22E0741: I am a proud Edoofian
18/01/23, 18:55 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
18/01/23, 20:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Chantelle!

18/01/23, 20:40 - Saloni Rastogi: Okay no worries, we can work with that.

20/01/23, 18:36 - Chantelle EWYL22E0741: Are we having our session now?
20/01/23, 20:41 - Chantelle EWYL22E0741: Ms Saloni?
20/01/23, 22:00 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings my proud edoofian!
Hope you are doing well.

While listening is an important skill, the art of asking questions is equally, if not more, important when it comes to learning more about your work tasks, unlocking hidden opportunities, delivering better results, and mitigating unforeseen risks. 
We have five guidelines to keep or to start asking good questions.

We discuss the following things:
1) what did you learn about it
2) progress on projects
20/01/23, 22:00 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for the delay, I was occupied in a meeting with Mr. Angad and then we had our lunch break.
21/01/23, 01:40 - Chantelle EWYL22E0741: I understand. I was unfortunately back to work by the time you responded. I do look forward to our next session and hope you have an amazing weekend
21/01/23, 21:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Please make a note of the following things:
1) No response will be accepted on the EWYL Group, it has to be done on the EWYL Line only.
2) I believe that you are aware that every morning you wake up, you need to follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' on the EWYL Line only. This ritual helps in keeping the family connected.
3) From now on, you have to reach out to me at your scheduled time of the session. In case you have not shared your activity\/lesson response to be within one hour of your scheduled session, I will mark that as a missed session and just to inform you that such a performance can go to the direct notice of the Academic Board of Edoofa under the defaulters' list. Make sure that you are punctual.
21/01/23, 21:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

A college student named Rachel was unsure of what career path to pursue after graduation. She talked to several professionals in different fields, but none of them seemed to fit her interests and skills. One day, she had a conversation with a mentor who asked her the right questions, such as \"What are you passionate about?\" and \"What do you enjoy doing in your free time?\" Rachel realized that her true passion was writing and storytelling. She decided to pursue a career in journalism and landed a job at a top news outlet.

We gained knowledge on how to ask intelligent questions. I'd like you to share with us any two questions you'd like to ask yourself as part of your Saturday submission. The questions that you may have been hesitant to make, the questions that put you in a difficult situation, the inquiries that will have a significant impact on your career and future. For example:  1. What is the limit of my current capabilities and how can I push beyond them to continue learning and growing?\"
2. “How can I ensure that my actions align with my values and contribute to the greater good, rather than just maximizing my own success?\"

Looking forward to your response!

21/01/23, 21:42 - Chantelle EWYL22E0741: Please clarify my confusions for me. As I mentioned previously,I can only be available from 9:30 to 10:30. Are we going to be having our sessions from 09:30 to 10:30 every day or just on Tuesdays and Fridays? Also, with our previous session, we couldn't meet up as you were held up in a meeting and by the time you became available,our time was up and thus,I was already back at work; I therefore was unsure of whether or not to still answer the questions for the lessons as I only became available after 4pm...does that then count as a penalty on my part?

24/01/23, 20:20 - Saloni Rastogi: For *Community Building Project*

Some of my students have formed WhatsApp groups with names like Edoofa Scholarship Prog\/Study In India\/Mission India by Edooda and so on…
This is how they begin-
First, they keep sharing the link of that WhatsApp group (which they formed) in their family groups, class groups, and school groups (A-Level and O-Level), with the children who stay nearby (who want to pursue their higher education), and, try to circulate all around.
Second, once new people get added to the group, they are told about Edoofa, the perks of being associated with it, why studying in India could be a great opportunity, their journey so far, learnings from EWYL Program, and more.
Third, they share the community building form with them, and then the children fill out the form and share it with me.
24/01/23, 20:20 - Saloni Rastogi: We have discussed this already right?
24/01/23, 20:52 - Chantelle EWYL22E0741: Yes we have
24/01/23, 20:53 - Chantelle EWYL22E0741: I am going to form a group once I get more potential candidates
24/01/23, 20:55 - Chantelle EWYL22E0741: For the two questions, I think I want to ask myself where I want to see myself in the next 5years and also, what happens after I get my Bachelor's Degree with LPU
24/01/23, 22:06 - Saloni Rastogi: So tell me, Chantelle, why did you choose that course at LPU?
25/01/23, 05:01 - Chantelle EWYL22E0741: It is in line with what I want my future based on. I want to not only help myself but my community and my country too. I wish to create change in my society and be still doing something that I love. I've wanted to work inside a Laboratory, helping improve the welfare and health of other human beings since the first time I entered a lab in highschool. I want to create change, this is the course for me and that is why I chose it

25/01/23, 18:32 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up.

I am a proud Edoofian
30/01/23, 00:02 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
