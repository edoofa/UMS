01/08/22, 18:55 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

The topic will be along the lines of how Mr. Kachaje went on to pursue a career in real estate by having a degree in the same field and eventually figured out his calling which was building the media brand  Magazine. One of the many benefits of starting a business or pursuing your passions when one is a bit older is that they bring all of the experience and wisdom to the table. 
The journey of Mr. Kachaje is certainly inspiring, growth-oriented, and a wonderful example for the youth of today, not only in terms of being passionate about what you believe in but also having a consistent outlook towards learning on the way and figuring things out at the same time.

06/08/22, 20:50 - Unknown: Good afternoon Dryad!
How's your day going?
06/08/22, 20:52 - Unknown: I am so happy to see you following our daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' on the EWYL Line.
06/08/22, 20:52 - Dryad EWYL21E0323: Good afternoon
Going on well
06/08/22, 20:52 - Unknown: Reading your response Dryad filled me with so much fire, passion, and motivation. It got reminded me of one quote:
“If you want to be happy the whole life, tie it to a goal, not people or objects.”

This was the quotation given by Alert Einstein and the quote which defines a goal.
Through this lesson, my main motive was to teach you that sacrifices are required to achieve the main target, and achievement of those important aims is necessary.
Those aims are:
1. Analysis of my strength and weaknesses – because this analysis will let me know how to work on both to make my strength more powerful and convert my weakness into my strength.
2. To be a good person and love yourself – To get positive vibes one should work on herself\/himself because “when you see yourself, with eyes full of love and acceptance, you hold space for others to meet you at your highest self “(by Karly Ryan).
3. Never regret any past decision – “Every bad decision gives you a lesson and this makes one’s vision more clear towards the achievement of its goal” as it is said by a great personality that takes responsibility and initiative for yourself stop blaming your circumstances for what you can change.
4. Always give 100% – there is a frame on my living room wall, of Swami Vivekananda that always gives me motivation the quotation written in it says “Arise, awake, and do not stop until the goal is reached”.
06/08/22, 20:52 - Unknown: I would like to share something about my goals.
My goals also consist of making my parents proud of their daughter, a daughter that will give them a more comfortable life, one that is not filled with such pain. Indeed, I cannot deny that truly I am not experienced as much as some people, but at least for me, every milestone in my life is an emblem of my growth. When I can complete something new successfully or learn something from my failure instead of complaining, I think I have grown up.
06/08/22, 20:53 - Unknown: Also Dryad, did you attend the webinar held tomorrow?
06/08/22, 20:53 - Dryad EWYL21E0323: That's great maam

08/08/22, 18:44 - Dryad EWYL21E0323: Thank you
08/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: One can be called successful if they have achieved their desired goals. For some people, being successful means being rich. But being successful is even more than being rich. When you achieve what you want, it gives you immense pleasure, and that is incomparable with being rich. To be successful in any aspect of life, one needs to have strong dedication and work hard.

1. discuss your understanding of the weekend activity.
