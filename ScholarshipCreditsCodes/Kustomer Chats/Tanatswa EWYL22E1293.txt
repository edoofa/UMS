02/05/23, 12:56 - Aditi Kapoor: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.

Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell:

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges.
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
 3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
02/05/23, 12:59 - Tanatswa EWYL22E1293: What a great lesson!i learn a lot,much thanks to you Sir

13/05/23, 13:13 - Tanatswa EWYL22E1293: Morning sir
24/05/23, 13:22 - Tanatswa EWYL22E1293: On the document,I'm taken to understand more about leadership and looked at servant leadership in detail,this is where the leader's main focus is the thriving of their company or organization.A leadership can be described as a leadership philosophy in which the goal of the leader is to serve.This is seen as diffrent from servant leader.The servant leader shares power,put the needs of the employees first and helps people to develop and perform as highly as possible,instead of the people working to serve the leader,the leader is there to serve the people.We are being given the founders of Edoofa as an example,Mr.Angad Singh and Mr.Avreen Singh,they have always been passionate about making differencies in other people's lives,that everyone can say he or she is a proud edoofian

Here are some characteristics of a servant leader:
Empathy,foresight,listening,building community,commitment,just to mention a few

Share in the comments if you have known this before and why is it important!!
10/06/23, 16:00 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week‚Äôs Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better‚Äîtogether. It‚Äôs why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger‚Äîas successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!

In Wednesday wisdom I learnt that,one must be good at reading books and that helps edoofians to be creative,critical thinkers and also good at solving problems

When Mr Angaad,came here in Zimbabwe this year July,he emphasized on the point that,one must not be happy because he or she is leave his or her home country and stay away,but a person must get there and work hard for the benefit of your family and the country as well,he also said that the main business there is to learn


Through the videos we watched in Bulawayo on the Meet and Greet session,l learnt something from their speech,through Edoofa one can learn new culture,reach far,study abroad and also exprerience new weather conditions

In a nutshell this is what I learnt,Edoofians must work hard in EWYL inorder to be independent financially and earn Learning
04/08/23, 16:57 - Aditi Kapoor: Well, this is so amazing Tanatswa!
I am impressed with how you have explained it.
