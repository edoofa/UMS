I will note down the details  then consult my mentor to see if these are the right companies that are required for my project. If my mentor approves them then I will connect with the decision makers of the company.

For the African reform project, I will actually create a group then invite my friends that want to study abroad. Then I will tell them all about the Edoofa scholarship program and my experience with it so far. I will also send some application forms to fill in then send them to my mentor.

Let us start Today’s morning with this motivational quote:
Teachers can open the door, but you must enter it yourself.

Can you tell me how is this quote applicable in our case?
12/10/22, 18:39 - Shalom EWYL22E0227: Good morning sir, I am fine thanks and you?

Well this quote is applicable in this way that you are my mentor and you are there to guide me. From this quote you are the one that opens the door for me. As for me it's now my choice to take your guidance with me in other words it's now my choice to do my projects, my assignments and the work that I'm required to do. From the quote I should enter it myself.
12/10/22, 19:41 - Unknown: This is what I am here for.
I will be helping you on every way of your journey. At the end, Your efforts will determine your success
12/10/22, 19:41 - Unknown: Also, Proud Edoofian, May I know when will you be submitting the Saturday's Activity?
It is already way past the deadline
12/10/22, 19:49 - Shalom EWYL22E0227: Yes that's right.
12/10/22, 19:49 - Shalom EWYL22E0227: Which one is it sir?
12/10/22, 20:42 - Unknown: Let me share that again with you
12/10/22, 20:42 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!
12/10/22, 21:17 - Shalom EWYL22E0227: Oh I'm very sorry sir, I didn't see it at all.

Otherwise I will certainly to the activity. I'm so sorry for the delay sir.
13/10/22, 21:00 - Unknown: Greetings, Proud Edoofian
I hope that you are in good health and spirits

Let us start Today’s morning with this motivational quote:
He who asks a question is a fool for five minutes; he who does not ask a question remains a fool forever.
13/10/22, 21:00 - Unknown: You also missed out on the Wednesday lesson that I was not able to share with you due to the pending last two submissions.

Today, At all costs, I would need the submission for the Last week's Saturday Activity.
I am sharing it below.

After that, I am sharing this week's Wednesday Lesson which you have to submit on Friday by 6 PM.

We can not allow ourselves to at a such mediocre pace.
13/10/22, 21:01 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.
13/10/22, 21:02 - Shalom EWYL22E0227: Good afternoon sir, I am fine thanks and you?

13/10/22, 22:19 - Unknown: Shalom, May I know what do you need to submit for this week's Wednesday Lesson?
13/10/22, 22:34 - Shalom EWYL22E0227: Sir personally after reading the Wednesday wisdom I didn't find any assignment or project that I'm supposed to do. Since I have two pending assignments I think those are the one I should be submitting by Friday.

19/10/22, 00:01 - Unknown: Let me first start by sharing the Saturday’s Activity:
19/10/22, 00:01 - Unknown: Hello my dear Edoofians
Hope you are doing well. This week we learned about one of the most popular yet grounded people who used social media as a tool to become an educator and give back to the community and still become an entrepreneur.
This week I want you to reflect on what your strengths and skills are to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 

These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content etc.
Please share these skills and instances where you were able to showcase these skills in your next session.
Till then 
Happy Learning!
19/10/22, 01:02 - Shalom EWYL22E0227: Yes that's a true fact.

At school we had a presentation competition where one had to make their own presentation and present it infront of the whole class. After presenting my presentation I got a very good mark and my teacher commented that I was very confident.

20/10/22, 13:05 - Shalom EWYL22E0227: The community building program sir. I want to spend about 3 hours working on this project sir. After posting about Edoofa on my social media I want to make sure that I get at least 8 people that inbox me to know more about this scholarship.
20/10/22, 13:05 - Shalom EWYL22E0227: Sir sorry for the inconvenience, yesterday I was not available I was helping with the art decorations for the functions that are being hosted. 
May you please excuse me from today till Friday.

Therefore I am sharing the Wednesday Lesson with you Today.
Also, Since, I am sharing this one day late, I am extending the deadline to Saturday at 9 AM from Friday at 6 PM.
20/10/22, 18:13 - Unknown: Hello, My Proud Edoofian.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.
21/10/22, 14:45 - Shalom EWYL22E0227: Good morning sir, how are you? Well its okay I understand.
21/10/22, 14:45 - Shalom EWYL22E0227: Well sir, I am very grateful  for my parents. My parents don't have much but they try by all means to make me happy and also make sure that I get what I want. Let me relate to how I got the opportunity to study in India. Well its not something that we were looking forward to and it was not even part of our plans but when I informed them about the scholarship and told them that I want to study abroad they made sure that they did all they can inorder for me to get what I want. So once again let me say that I am grateful for the loving and caring parents that are able to sacrifice anything for me to be happy✨.
21/10/22, 16:18 - Unknown: Greetings, Proud Edoofian
I hope that you are in good health and spirits

Here is a motivational quote for you:
\"You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.\" – Zig Ziglar
21/10/22, 16:19 - Unknown: Great!
Proud Edoofian, Do you know why being grateful is important?
In positive psychology research, gratitude is strongly and consistently associated with greater happiness. Gratitude helps people feel more positive emotions, relish good experiences, improve their health, deal with adversity, and build strong relationships.
21/10/22, 16:22 - Shalom EWYL22E0227: That's a great quote to start a day with.  Thank you!
22/10/22, 13:29 - Shalom EWYL22E0227: Yes that's very true sir.
22/10/22, 17:54 - Unknown: Greetings, Proud Edoofian

We won't be having any sessions Today, Sunday and Monday. You will soon receive a message explaining the reason for this. But I would get in touch with you in case I require any updates on the EWYL Projects, okay?

Also, I would want you to follow the points given below:
◼️Make sure that you follow the *Proud Edoofian* ritual (Even on Sunday?)
◼️Keep an eye on the *Saturday Activity* that will be shared with you today evening.
◼️Also, If you haven't submitted the *Wednesday Lesson* yet, Please make sure that you submit it as soon as possible.

I wish you a blessed and joyful weekend ahead✨

10/11/22, 21:46 - Shalom EWYL22E0227: Good afternoon sir. Sir u am okay but the problem is that sir you not communicating with me. One moment you tell me to do assignments that you claim to have told me about. I tell you that but you don't even respond. All you want me to do is to say the Edoofa ritual okay I'm wrong for not saying it sir but sir may you please communicate with me. You didn't even send me the Wednesday wisdom or Saturday activity. The last time we talked was on the 22nd of October when you were telling me to watch out for the assignments and activities I get on Wednesday and Saturday but since that day you didn't send me anything.

Wednesday Lesson

Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian,

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Deadline: Saturday 9 AM
Happy Learning.
