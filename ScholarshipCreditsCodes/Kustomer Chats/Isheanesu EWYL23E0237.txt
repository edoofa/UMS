01/12/23, 15:29 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Am a proud Edoofian
01/12/23, 15:29 - Ananya: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

An inspiring and insightful webinar by the brilliant Mr. Ian P Vengarai, where we dive deep into the realm of self actualization!

Learn the keys to unlocking your full potential and achieving true happiness in all aspects of your life
01/12/23, 15:30 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: What is the purpose of the link
01/12/23, 15:31 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Greetings to you Mam
01/12/23, 15:37 - Ananya: Good morning and happy new month,  Isheanesu! üåû‚ú®

As we kick off our session today, let's start with a question: What exciting plans do you have for this month? Whether it's academic goals, personal projects, or anything else, I'm here to support you. Let's make December a month of growth and achievement! üöÄüìö
01/12/23, 15:46 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Same to you mam. Mmmmm as for this month am jus working towards earning money for the festive season
01/12/23, 15:47 - Ananya: Great! Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
01/12/23, 15:48 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Noted mam
01/12/23, 15:50 - Ananya: Now, I believe that we should start with something that aligns with your interests. So, would you like to tell me which one is your favorite project: the community building or the schools connect?
01/12/23, 16:13 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Mmm l think the community building
01/12/23, 16:13 - Ananya: Well, that's great! May I ask about your progress in that project so far?
01/12/23, 16:15 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Am still gathering the contacts of people who are not yet involved with Edoofa because now most of people are now aware and have applied
01/12/23, 16:18 - Ananya: Alright, should I share an incredible idea for finding more potential students?
01/12/23, 16:18 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Yes mam
01/12/23, 16:18 - Ananya: You know, one of my students' friends is studying in a different school. She has actually joined their WhatsApp class groups and is now communicating with them. Not only that, since she is connected with students from various schools, she is also obtaining the contact information of school administrators. This way, she is working on two separate projects simultaneously.
Don't you think it is an amazing idea?
01/12/23, 16:20 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Yeah it's effective
01/12/23, 16:23 - Ananya: Alright, in addition to the resources we already have in our EWYL group, I was thinking of sharing a few more with you. This way, you can then pass them along to your students and school heads.
01/12/23, 16:24 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Alrigh mam
01/12/23, 16:25 - Ananya: You can also share our Edoofa Instagram page.
Additionally, did you know that the First Lady of Zimbabwe took time during her visit to India to meet the CEO of Edoofa? How can this be a fraud?
Moreover, did you know that Edoofa was one of the official sponsors of the NSQC event this year?
01/12/23, 16:25 - Ananya: .
01/12/23, 16:25 - Ananya: .
01/12/23, 16:28 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Thanks mam
01/12/23, 16:36 - Ananya: Keeping our today's session short, let us connect in our next session. Let's end the session with a smile: Why did the bicycle fall over?

Because it was two-tired! üòÑ
01/12/23, 16:38 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: ü§£ü§£ alright mam have a blessed time

05/12/23, 15:29 - Ananya: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

December is finally here, and winter is at its peak!
Link: https://www.instagram.com/p/C0UAba4s3i8/?img_index=1 
Share your winter wonderland dreams!Let us know how you plan to make the most of this magical time of the year!
05/12/23, 15:30 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Greetings to you mam
05/12/23, 15:40 - Ananya: Good afternoon, Isheanesu!

Here's a fun and easy fact to brighten your day: Honeybees can recognize human faces! These tiny creatures have an amazing ability to remember and distinguish between different human faces. So, the next time you see a bee buzzing around, maybe it's just saying, "Hello!"üêù
05/12/23, 15:40 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Am fine and you mam
05/12/23, 15:45 - Ananya: Thank you for asking, I am doing great!
05/12/23, 15:48 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: So what are the objectives of today
05/12/23, 15:57 - Ananya: Well, you have missed your Saturday activity! I hope you understand that each and every activity is recorded to track your progress and regularity in your EWYL sessions. A significant gap in your Saturday activity can have a negative impact.
05/12/23, 15:59 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Am so sorry mam
05/12/23, 16:05 - Ananya: That's alright.Well, during our last conversation, I set a target for you. So, may I ask about how far you have come with that? Are you facing any challenges?
05/12/23, 16:08 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Mmm challenges are on school headmasters's contacts because l asked my head about that but he is still searching for them
05/12/23, 16:09 - Ananya: Alright, so everything is going well with the community building project?
05/12/23, 16:12 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Yes mam but most of my fellows are now aware and have already applied that's why the applications forms are not in big numbers
05/12/23, 16:12 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: But l will keep pushing
05/12/23, 16:14 - Ananya: Alright, let me help you with finding some potential students.
05/12/23, 16:31 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Alright mam
05/12/23, 16:32 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Am sorry for being late l was attending one of the students to apply
05/12/23, 16:35 - Ananya: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
05/12/23, 16:35 - Ananya: *Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
05/12/23, 16:39 - Isheanesu EWYL23E0237: Alright mam

09/12/23, 18:44 - Ananya: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

13/12/23, 15:41 - Ananya: *Happy Wednesday*üåª

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into ‚Äì the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work ‚Äì a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.üåü

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.ü§ù

Best regards,
Team EWYL
