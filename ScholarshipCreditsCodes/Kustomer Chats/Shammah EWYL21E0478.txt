15/07/22, 21:31 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

18/07/22, 16:19 - Shammah EWYL21E0478: Weekend task
The educational sector which is by far the most ignored sector in Zimbabwe has proved to be the most fast growing sector. The fact that some programs being offered at tertiary level in Zimbabwe are not technologically based  programs, students of this generation don't seem to have interest in them and they end up going to other countries in search of what they really want. Bringing that same opportunity to them here in Zimbabwe would be a great advantage in that many profits would be made and not so many people will have to go outside the country. I have seen individuals who have opened up Health institutes and some institutes of Law. These people take their time grooming and monitoring their students' abilities from secondary level up to when they are now professionals. This alone allows people to not divert from their ambitions and for them to follow a career path they are passionate about. The aviation school in Zimbabwe is very expensive yet many students attend it, this alone shows that if the same opportunities are brought to Zimbabweans the probability of one suffering a loss is zero. The world has evolved and what surrounds the minds of many children is technology. The fact that technology is not being fully embraced in Zimbabwe is leading to the joblessness that many students are running away from. Providing technologically advanced education will not only give people what they want but instead create employment in their generation. I have seen students who go to countries like Zambia to get education there. And despite it being an African country it's economy is growing because of its education sector. Opening up an institute with technologically advanced programs in Zimbabwe for example rocket science, Aerospace engineering and many more programs in Zimbabwe will be a great business opportunity. This is because in this generation Education is power and parents are ready to go out of their way to provide quality education to their

18/07/22, 16:21 - Shammah EWYL21E0478: Adobe effects are more accessible and they help people stay more organized. It has improved performance when it comes to the
 creation and editing of shapes. The effects are benefitial in that they have enhanced graphics and text which can be used in work places for planning presentations and the setup for better
 and effective  communication with clients. Expressions used in Adobe are applied to master properties,
 they do not change overtime and are significantly faster as well. However, adobe has an expanded format and better playbacks support and shows better notifications for system compatibility. The other interesting effect is that it allows one to work visually when keyboard shortcuts are applied. Furthermore one can use the keyboard user interface to view the keys that have been assigned shortcuts. Some of the effects allows one to create simple movies and some project set up in the simple possible way. Upon designing one is able to remove unwanted objects faster or even enhance the available content. Further editing can be done for example creation of glass orbs in 3D images and in addition a spherical and reflection map from the images. The other interesting effect is the Jumbotron column where one can create realistic games. One can make everything colourful by even adding rain and atmosphere in what ever is being dealt with. These effect actually help people express there feeling and communicate better in all sectors which they will be dealing with.

18/07/22, 22:10 - Unknown: Have a look at the below answer, The Student was given the below question and now he has written the below answers, He has related the questions by referring to Skooqs Indirectly , 



Have you learned as much or more from watching educational videos in YouTube or other sites as you did in college?


Well me personally l think watching videos online is a major help in a person educational life. During my studies in school everytime l encountered a topic or experiment l did not fully grasped l always went online to understand more from differnt tutors on google, youtube and wikipedia to understand more. This to my surprise was more helpful than listening to a lecture because the whole concept of a topic could be coverd in a matter of minutes than to take a whole week on the same topic. I remember there we some experiment practicals l didn't understand by simply reading a book or being lectured about but by watching a youtube video seeing it being done for real made me understand everything.l owe it big time to those videos online cause without the l would be having many difficulties in school.

I am now pretty fond of a new program online which l think is making a big change in the minds of children everywhere.This prog is called SKOOQS and is nurturing small children in the field of technology until they are teenagers.l am happy that kids can become adapted to this world we live in consistently changing due to technology.If you want your child to be dazzled by this experience look up for SKOOQS online and see what is has to offer.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
