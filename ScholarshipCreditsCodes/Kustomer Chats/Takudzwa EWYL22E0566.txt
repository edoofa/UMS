21/11/22, 22:03 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0566: Yes
22/11/22, 00:59 - Unknown: Dear Proud Edoofian! Here's a short story for you. I hope it will help you deal with any negative results in your projects and gives you a new sense of motivation to work hard and keep hustling. So here we go!

At the beginning of a new school year, a class teacher stands up in front of her students holding a $100 bill.

She tells them, “Put your hands up if you want this money”.

Every hand in the room goes up, to which the teacher says, “I am going to give this money to someone here, but first, let me do this…”

She takes the bill and crumples it up in her hands, before asking, “Who still wants it?”

The hands stay up.

The teacher then drops the bill on the floor, stomps and grinds it into the ground, and picks it back up. “How about now?” she asks again.

The hands stay up.

“Class, I hope you see the lesson here. It didn’t matter what I did to this money, you still wanted it because its value stayed the same. Even with its creases and dirtiness, it’s still worth $100.”

She continues, “It’s the same with us. There will be similar times in your life when you’re dropped, bruised, and muddied. Yet no matter what happens, you never lose your value.”

Moral of the story:

Life’s hardships are inevitable and we’ll all be put through the wringer at some point, often through no fault of our own.

Don’t let these challenges alter your feelings of self-worth. You’ll always be enough; you have something unique and special to give and offer to the world.

31/01/23, 22:21 - Unknown: Takudzwa, As discussed before, In Today’s session, We will be discussing *How we can improve our performance on the African School Education Reform Mission Project*.

Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
31/01/23, 22:26 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0566: Q1Mpopoma high school. Not connected with Edoofa
31/01/23, 22:26 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0566: Q2i don't have those at the moment
31/01/23, 22:26 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0566: Q3 Bulawayo
31/01/23, 22:29 - Unknown: Proud Edoofian, This week, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
31/01/23, 22:29 - Unknown: May I know if you have Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead tomorrow.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him\/her for your School Head’s Contact.
31/01/23, 22:35 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0566: I'll look for it
31/01/23, 22:49 - Unknown: Great!
31/01/23, 22:50 - Unknown: So can you get it back to me by the next session?
31/01/23, 22:54 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0566: Okay I'll try
31/01/23, 23:10 - Unknown: Great!
31/01/23, 23:11 - Unknown: Now, Once you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering professional communication, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
31/01/23, 23:11 - Unknown: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.


So, This is what the First message should look like:
31/01/23, 23:33 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0566: Okay
31/01/23, 23:39 - Unknown: Greetings Mr.\/Mrs *School Head Name*

01/02/23, 19:20 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

Happy Learning!
