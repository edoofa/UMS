05/07/23, 12:43 - Tatenda EWYL23E0261: Greetings Ms. Saloni, I am Tatenda and I am here to resume my EWYL  discussions . My EWYL group name is Tatenda EWYL23E0261 .
05/07/23, 12:43 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Tatenda!
How are you?
05/07/23, 12:44 - Tatenda EWYL23E0261: I am well thank you
05/07/23, 12:44 - Tatenda EWYL23E0261: How are you
05/07/23, 12:45 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing well, thank you.
05/07/23, 12:45 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
05/07/23, 12:45 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
05/07/23, 12:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
05/07/23, 12:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *12:00-01:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,

28/11/23, 16:33 - Tatenda EWYL23E0261: The Spirit of competition it is the ability to be able to accept any challenge thrown at you either by a friend or colleague. 
The Spirit of competition has helped me stay on my toes as I'm always ready to tackle any challenges no matter how hard the challenge may be to win it . For example in my academics it has always been hard for me to pass until I met a group of students who helped me do better by helping each other through different topics to present about in any subject thus whenever it came to tests we would make sure to do better than the other at all times.  This influenced my way of approaching challenges and goals to always prepare for anything at all times and from different angles of both life and academics.
28/11/23, 16:41 - Saloni Rastogi: I appreciate your acknowledgment of the importance of the spirit of competition. Embracing challenges and collaborating with others to excel in academics reflects a commendable attitude. Your dedication to continuous improvement and readiness to approach challenges from different angles is truly commendable. Keep up the excellent mindset of always being prepared for whatever comes your way, both in academics and in life. Your commitment to growth and collaboration is inspiring!
28/11/23, 16:41 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's streamline our approach for maximum impact on the projects! Here are your options:
