19/09/23, 16:40 - Masimba EWYL23E0619: Am I expected to contribute my opinion also?
19/09/23, 17:11 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes Masimba
19/09/23, 17:13 - Masimba EWYL23E0619: One of the most effective ways to prepare for exams is to practice taking past versions. This helps you get used to the format of the questions, and  if you time yourself can also be good practice for making sure you spend the right amount of time on each section. This is even more effective when done with study partner(s) or a tutor.

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....
