17/08/22, 17:52 - Courage EWYL22E0496: Hello sir I'm Courage Mapiye
17/08/22, 21:44 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times pere week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these att
18/08/22, 17:19 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, how are you doing?
Today I wanted to discuss the recent message I shared with you. The message that we want to be our daily habit, our words of connecting and experiencing a sense of belonging, We all at team Edoofa are very thrilled as we personally are undertaking the same activity. May I know what have you understood from this message, what is the intention behind the same?
18/08/22, 18:15 - Courage EWYL22E0496: I just understand that to be a proud Edoofian you must have constant belief in Attitude skills and knowledge
18/08/22, 18:17 - Jasmine Kaur: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

25/08/22, 22:57 - Jasmine Kaur: The Wednesday Wisdom Lesson this week will focus on three business success stories that went from rags to riches. Additionally, social learning is a very effective method of learning. You can learn from the mistakes and accomplishments of others, so you don't have to figure everything out on your own, for instance.

Your mentors will have a thorough discussion in our forthcoming session about what you think were the factors that led to the success of the three panellists listed here after you have carefully listened to the audio file and read the PDF.
Happy learning!

a)Target- no. of credits you want to earn in the month of October
b)How many projects can you work upon
c)Number of hours that you can devote to your projects
d)Name of the projects that you want to be a part of
e)Plan of action with your mentors

You are required to submit these answers by 3rd October 2022. Let me know in case you face any challenges in Submitting the responses.

Christmas is celebrated by people all across the world, whether they are Christians or non Christians. Christmas is the perfect time when friends and families come together, spreading joy and happiness.You must be aware of the concept of \"SECRET SANTA,\" but do you know who he or she was, or how the lovely process of sharing joy began? In today's Wednesday Wisdom, let's find out more about the secret Santa. The secret Santa has a special message for you at the end. We'll get in touch and discuss your takeaways in more detail.

Happy learning and smiling!
15/12/22, 19:14 - Jasmine Kaur: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

Here is the quote for today:

 I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. –Michael Jordan

15/12/22, 19:28 - Jasmine Kaur: After receiving and opening your present, you must guess who you think your Secret Santa is. Finding out who picked your name while hiding your own identity as someone’s Secret Santa makes this Christmas tradition exciting and enjoyable between families, friends, and peers.
Don’t you think so?

16/12/22, 19:06 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello, my proud edoofian!
Let us start your session.

You can see it every day, but you cannot touch it. What is it?
17/12/22, 02:04 - Courage EWYL22E0496: Water

17/12/22, 02:31 - Jasmine Kaur: Effective and timely feedback is a crucial part of a successful performance, as I discussed with you in our Saturday activity. I wanted to get in touch with you to share your EWYL report card and ask you to evaluate your performance by responding to the following questions:

1. How would you rate your performance from 1-10, 10 being the highest score?
2. What is your goal- in terms of skills and amount of scholarship credits that you want to earn?
3. What is your plan- how will you achieve the above mentioned goal?

The answers you give here will be evaluated by Ms Deepali and Ms Davi. So take you time and share your responses here in the group itself.
17/12/22, 03:00 - Courage EWYL22E0496: *Answer 1*

 I would rate my self 2 out of 10
The main reason for that is that I'm facing challenges as the school principal are not responding to my text and same I was on exams but now I'm done and I will pull harder
17/12/22, 03:02 - Courage EWYL22E0496: Answer 2
I want to achieve my best ...by earning my scholarship credits as it minimises the cost for my fees and it also makes life easier as the cost won't be to high ,so I will try my level best to score higher
17/12/22, 03:05 - Courage EWYL22E0496: *Answer 3*
I want to explain to my friends about Edoofa and explain more about it so that they can be Edoofians .Last time I talked to my friends and they sign the application form but there was no responds which turn them down and my hard word was to no avail.
I will talk to variety of school principal so that they take part in this program.
