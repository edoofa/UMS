This week's Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the topic of \"Seeking Wealth, not Money or Status.\" This is an important lesson that will provide valuable insights into the pursuit of financial stability and success. During this lesson, we will explore the concept of wealth and its importance in building a sustainable financial future. We will discuss the difference between wealth, money, and status, and how each of these concepts plays a role in our lives.
I encourage you to read the lesson in detail and take notes to fully understand the material. It is important to engage with this topic and think critically about your own financial goals and aspirations.
By understanding the importance of seeking wealth over money or status, you can develop a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial success. I look forward to exploring this topic with you in more detail during our upcoming lesson.

Happy learning!","transform":"

How are you?
Please share your understanding of the Wednesday lesson so that we can soon discuss the PROJECTS.
17/03/23, 22:11 - Elias EWYL22E1306: Ok
17/03/23, 22:11 - Elias EWYL22E1306: Doing well
17/03/23, 22:15 - Elias EWYL22E1306: In real life, we must invest into real business, stocks and rental property that last longer even generation  to generation. This helps us to become financially stable
17/03/23, 22:49 - Aditi Kapoor: You have concluded the understanding of the lesson so well. Even my learning has been that 'Money is simply a tool that we use to transfer time and wealth, and that status is not a measure of true success or happiness. Instead, focus on building wealth and creating a life that brings you joy and fulfillment.' 
And you know _earning scholarship credits_ is just parallel to creating that joy and fulfillment and aiming higher by seeing how much you have earned and beating all the records.
17/03/23, 22:51 - Aditi Kapoor: I see that the number of participants has increased in the group that you have created but I have not seen that you are sharing the information with them about Edoofa that I have shared with you. May I know how are you informing them?
17/03/23, 23:25 - Elias EWYL22E1306: I'm doing it personally
18/03/23, 04:23 - Aditi Kapoor: Let's continue tomorrow for the weekend activity and our discussion.​
​You know I learned something new today, that is I need to make full use of all the opportunities offered to us and value them.​
​ I also wish the same for you, that you explore the EWYL Program and its amazing opportunities like the projects and continuous learning.
So, think about it and plan tomorrow accordingly.
Till then, have great day?
18/03/23, 04:35 - Elias EWYL22E1306: Ok
18/03/23, 20:39 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings *my proud edoofian*!

Here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!

21/03/23, 21:55 - Aditi Kapoor: How's your health now Elias?
21/03/23, 21:56 - Aditi Kapoor: You know I am deeply inspired by the missions that you have shared with me.
I was stuck at the point where you mentioned that the first step is hard to step, I am sure that with hard work we can surely achieve it.
Along with this, in every response, I like to enlighten my students on how I feel about the lesson\/activity and how smoothly it connects with them.
For this one also, I would firstly say that my biggest mission is to provide a happy life for my mother who has done so much for me in the past so many years.
And the second goal, that I believe is driving me every day to work hard is the curiosity to meet my students at the airport and see them earning at least $100 of scholarship credits every month so that they become so independent that can pay their own fees.
21/03/23, 21:57 - Aditi Kapoor: Also Elias, may I know the challenges you are facing with the community building project so far?
