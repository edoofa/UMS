29/08/23, 19:29 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

Hope you are doing well, I would like to announce that tomorrow is a holiday on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan which is an auspicious Indian Festival so I am sharing the lesson with you today!

So for this week's Wednesday lesson,  I have an exciting topic to delve into: Hidden Talent.
We'll dive into the captivating story of Samuel, a character whose seemingly ordinary life takes a fascinating turn when his secret talent comes to light. Through his story, we'll discover the power of talents that lie beneath the surface, waiting for the perfect moment to shine.
So, bring your curiosity and imagination as we delve into Samuel's tale and discuss the significance of hidden talents in our own lives. You might even find yourself reflecting on your own unique abilities that are yet to be revealed.

In our upcoming session I would like to know if you have a hidden talent that you're particularly good at or passionate about? It could be anything ‚Äì from artistic pursuits to something more unexpected.

Get ready to be inspired, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together!

We hope this message finds you well and thriving in your academic journey. Today, we want to encourage you to step out of your comfort zone and share your hidden talents. Whether you're a budding poet, a passionate musician, a mesmerizing dancer, a gifted painter, or possess any unique skill, it's time to embrace your talent and showcase it with unwavering confidence.

We believe that each one of you possesses a hidden gem within, waiting to be discovered. Your talents are not just hobbies; they are an integral part of who you are. They make you unique and add vibrancy to our academic community.

Why a video, you ask? Well, videos are a powerful medium to convey emotions and connect with others. They allow you to express yourself fully, capturing the essence of your talent. So, poets, we want to see you recite your verses with passion, musicians, let your melodies shine, dancers, grace the screen with your moves, and artists, unveil your creative masterpieces.

Remember, your talent is a gift that deserves to be celebrated and shared. By showcasing your hidden talents, you not only inspire others but also gain the confidence to pursue your passions further. You are required to submit your videos before our next session.

Happy Learning!
Team EWYL
