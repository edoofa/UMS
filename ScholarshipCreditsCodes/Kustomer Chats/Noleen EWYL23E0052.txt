23/09/23, 16:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
How are you doing?

Welcome to the EWYL Line, this is Ms. Saloni.
23/09/23, 17:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Before we begin, as you have come on the EWYL Line, you have already completed some basic formalities. Now, I would want that we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.

I kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let me know.
23/09/23, 17:24 - Noleen EWYL23E0052: Hie Saloni hope you are well...your student will be available in November after the examinations
