04/08/23, 12:35 - Takunda EWYL23E0283: What l understood from the wednesday newsletter on Mastering the Art of Adaptability 

Adaptability is the abilility to adjust to new circumstances and enviroment.This enables to solve differences between different people.As for me preparing to come to india,l should reseach more about Indian culture, skills,festivals and the way to talk to local people.This helps to become more adaptable without differences.

Also empathy is the abilility to understand and share feelings of others.Respect beliefs and values of local people.

Adapting into indian culture Avoid interfering in political issues

08/08/23, 13:55 - Aditi Kapoor: Also I would suggest you to go through our discussion I the EWYL Group to recap the project details.
08/08/23, 13:56 - Takunda EWYL23E0283: no but you can briefly explain it so that l can be clear
08/08/23, 13:57 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay sure!
08/08/23, 14:00 - Aditi Kapoor: You will reach out to local schools in your region and speak to the principals and headmasters and inform them about the Edoofa Program. You will have to share the program details with them and ask them if they would like a meeting with the Edoofa Program director.

If they agree you will share their contact details with me in the format that is provided to you.
08/08/23, 14:00 - Aditi Kapoor: You can use the following form to share the school details with me.
08/08/23, 14:00 - Aditi Kapoor: 1. School Name:
2. School Province:
3. Name of the contact person:
4. Designation of the contact person:
5. Whatsapp Number:
6. Year of the establishment of the School:
7. Pass% of A level (Last Academic year):
8. No. of teachers in School:
9. The number of students in A level:
10. Fees structure in A level (Per Term in USD):
11. Date of Call:
12. Time of the scheduled meeting (CAT):



*Details submitted by*:
1. Full Name:
2. EWYL Group Name:
3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
08/08/23, 14:02 - Aditi Kapoor: Also as suggested earlier it would be better if you would share the forms in the group so that Ms. Deepali can also see your progress.
08/08/23, 14:02 - Takunda EWYL23E0283: sure l am really clear about it
08/08/23, 14:03 - Aditi Kapoor: Perfect, so may I know when you will start reaching out to the schools.
08/08/23, 14:04 - Aditi Kapoor: And also one very important thing I would like to share regarding this project.
08/08/23, 14:04 - Aditi Kapoor: When the schoolâ€™s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
08/08/23, 14:09 - Takunda EWYL23E0283: well mam in my local community many schools pay less than hundred dollars as their school fees
08/08/23, 14:09 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay
08/08/23, 14:11 - Aditi Kapoor: You can use social media platforms like _Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and your network of friends, peers, neighbors, and cousins to get the contact details of the schools and then, we can follow with similar communication.

That firstly, you will share the contact details/school form with me so that we are on the same page.

Second, you will share the introductory message with the School Head/Headmaster.
08/08/23, 14:12 - Takunda EWYL23E0283: sure mam ,thank you
08/08/23, 14:15 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, so next time when we meet for our session I need updates on this alright I want you to work really hard on your projects because I know that you have the potential for the growth and success that you aspire to achieve.
08/08/23, 14:19 - Takunda EWYL23E0283: okay mam l will work very hard on the projects
08/08/23, 14:21 - Aditi Kapoor: Well, I am happy to see your dedication and determination.
