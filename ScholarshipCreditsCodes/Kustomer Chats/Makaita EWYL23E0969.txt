🚀 Brace yourself for a lesson sprinkled with knowledge and a dash of holiday cheer! 🎄🎁

Today's Wednesday Wisdom is not just special but carries a powerful reminder of the true essence of Christmas. As we stand on the brink of the festive season, it's crucial to reflect on the values that unite us as a community.

Beyond the glittering lights and festive decorations, Christmas serves as a poignant reminder of the core values that bind humanity together. It's a time when love, compassion, and generosity take center stage, fostering a sense of togetherness and shared joy.

Let's take a moment today to embrace the spirit of Christmas, appreciating the significance of our connections with one another. The lessons learned during this festive season go beyond the celebration itself, leaving a lasting impact on the way we interact with those around us.

May this Wednesday Wisdom inspire you to carry the spirit of Christmas not just during the holiday season but throughout the year! 🎄✨

Wishing you a joyous and reflective Wednesday!

Warm regards,
Team EWYL

21/12/23, 16:32 - Makaita EWYL23E0969: Do you want me to choose between the two,the one I want to do
21/12/23, 16:33 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, you can choose the one that you think will fit it better
21/12/23, 16:35 - Makaita EWYL23E0969: Option 1
21/12/23, 16:39 - Saloni Rastogi: That is great, Makaita!
21/12/23, 16:39 - Saloni Rastogi: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*

For eg: In your case, it will be-

*Makaita/Saloni/21DEC2023*
21/12/23, 16:40 - Saloni Rastogi: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
21/12/23, 16:40 - Saloni Rastogi: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
21/12/23, 16:40 - Saloni Rastogi: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
21/12/23, 16:40 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
21/12/23, 16:40 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a process that we have discussed in our initial phase of project discussions, I hope you remember this?
21/12/23, 16:44 - Makaita EWYL23E0969: Yes I di
21/12/23, 16:45 - Makaita EWYL23E0969: Yes I do
21/12/23, 16:56 - Saloni Rastogi: Have you formed the group?
21/12/23, 17:32 - Makaita EWYL23E0969: Yes I have
21/12/23, 18:34 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know if you have added me in the group as well?
21/12/23, 18:35 - Saloni Rastogi: We're wrapping up the session here!

Just 4 days until Christmas🎄, and I'm buzzing with excitement to hear all about your festive plans. Now, let's chat about something that's been filling my inbox with joy – Secret Santa🎅🏽! I haven't experienced it much myself, but every year during this time, my students flood me with pictures, sharing how their Secret Santa wishes came true. So tell me – what's on your Secret Santa wishlist, and why?
21/12/23, 20:57 - Makaita EWYL23E0969: Let me do that
21/12/23, 21:00 - Makaita EWYL23E0969: My wish is for my cousin to not leave Harare and go to Masvingo because I got used to her company and she is the only one I link with,so I'm kind of sad because of that
