The founder us appreciating each student's passion, dedication and commitment for learning.He is inspired by every student's dream, aspiration and rentless pursuit of excellence.

*The Quotes*

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.‚Äù ‚ÄìZig Ziglar
‚ÄúThe way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.‚Äù ‚ÄìWalt Disney
‚ÄúThere are no shortcuts to any place worth going.‚Äù ‚ÄîBeverly Stills


Here he was urging students to take a step forward first in order to become great.And to be successful,one has to stop talking but let his actions to success do the talking.


Wealth creation requires vision, strategy and endless effort.By adopting more holistic approaches like seeking opportunities,and continuous growth, individuals can leverage their resources to build sustainable wealth.

Seeking opportunities demands some willing to take risks and ability to adapt changing circumstances for the better.It also requires people with the dexterity to identify opportunities.A successful enterpreneur researchs,networks and stays informed about trending markets.This helps one to position himself ahead of the curve.


*Seeking opportunities is all about being eager and zealous to learn and this leads to new ventures and valuable experiences.*


Building solid foundation is crucial for suitable wealth creation.This involves managing debt responsibly, building strong financial base and creating streams of income.For financial stability, budgeting,wise spending habits and saving are very vital key components.*

*These 2 complements each other in making profits as one will have to stay updated on market trends and also good spending habits.One will never suffer loss in his business.*


To ensure ongoing learning,skill development and adaptability in an ever-evolving economic landscape one should.
1.Invest in oneself through education,skill enhancement and personal growth
2. Understand the power of compounding.
3.Reinvesting profits and letting investment grow


*One can overcome this by being patient and disciplined and consistent efforts.*


*Hall of inspiration*

Ruvimbo is sharing her experience in starting their Agrabbit company at their very tender age.To be successful,the students had confidence and belief in the small ideas they had and expanded bravely and united.They created a big fertilizer company which is  currently running,all from mere rabbit urine and food droppings.She is urging us to know and gain skills to talk to customers and persuade them to buy their products.We should speak and let our voices be heard no matter how young we may be,since the sky is the only limit
