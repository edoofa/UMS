07/08/22, 22:05 - ALLAN EWYL21E0657: *I am a proud Edoofian*
07/08/22, 22:07 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

One can be called successful if they have achieved their desired goals. For some people, being successful means being rich. But being successful is even more than being rich. When you achieve what you want, it gives you immense pleasure, and that is incomparable with being rich. To be successful in any aspect of life, one needs to have strong dedication and work hard. 
Our *WEEKEND ACTIVITY* discussed the traits of a successful person.
So, in our session today:
1. discuss your understanding of the weekend activity.
2. make weekly plans on achieving targets on three ongoing projects.
