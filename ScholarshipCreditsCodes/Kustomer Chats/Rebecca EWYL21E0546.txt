20/07/22, 21:09 - Rebecca EWYL21E0546: Good morning.....few skills or practices that a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits are Passion, Confidence, Composure, Enthusiasm, Ability to be a Team , Analytical Skills,
Foresight.
20/07/22, 21:25 - Unknown: I am really glad to hear your understanding of the activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY* . They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost up, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.
20/07/22, 21:30 - Unknown: Now I am sharing with you the weekend activity and the way you have expressed your idea, I am expecting the same response from you Rebecca.
20/07/22, 21:32 - Unknown: It's that time of the week when you are required to wear your thinking caps and get your tools ready to research and learn! From our Wednesday Wisdom, we learned how Patrice Motsepe, became successful by making the best of the opportunity very few could see, the strong potential in the mining industry. As part of your Saturday Activity, you are required to share a detailed submission on the fast-growing industry\/sector\/business in your country. Don’t forget to add a SWOT analysis and predictions on the future performance of the same.

Word limit- 250-500 words\u2028Use of the internet is allowed but do not copy the entire submission from the internet. You have to write it in your own words.
Deadline   3 PM
20/07/22, 22:59 - Unknown: Have you joined the meeting Rebecca?
20/07/22, 23:08 - Rebecca EWYL21E0546: Noted Saturday 3pm or today
20/07/22, 23:16 - Rebecca EWYL21E0546: No my network is slow
21/07/22, 03:37 - Unknown: Today Rebecca.
21/07/22, 22:26 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Rebecca!
How are you doing?
21/07/22, 22:27 - Unknown: I have not received your response yet to the weekend activity Rebecca, may I know why?
In case you are facing any challenges, please let me know, I am there to help you out.
21/07/22, 22:28 - Unknown: Along with this, let's move on with our session.
Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our *WEDNESDAY Wisdom* was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
3. your pending response to the weekend activity
25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
