22/08/23, 13:42 - Rutendo EWYL22E0574: I thought by now I would've gotten the projects I'm supposed to work on but that is not the case.
22/08/23, 13:44 - Rutendo EWYL22E0574: Also with the current situation that I'm not going to school I've taken up menial jobs hence i have very little time to be on my phone lately.

22/08/23, 13:47 - Rutendo EWYL22E0574: Alright ma'am I'll be sure to do that
22/08/23, 13:50 - Tenzin: Okay. Rutendo.
22/08/23, 13:51 - Tenzin: Did you read when I tried to explain the projects in writing?
22/08/23, 13:54 - Rutendo EWYL22E0574: Yes I read it and i can say i understood very well

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:-
August 2023 or August 2024
22/08/23, 13:56 - Rutendo EWYL22E0574: Alright thank you
22/08/23, 13:56 - Tenzin: And #2 ‚Äì Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here‚Äôs a quick recap of what‚Äôs the opportunity for you here-
1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university √† you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
22/08/23, 13:57 - Rutendo EWYL22E0574: That's interesting I'll work hard so that i can as much scholarship credits as I can
22/08/23, 14:03 - Tenzin: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
22/08/23, 14:28 - Rutendo EWYL22E0574: Okay I'm listenint
22/08/23, 14:29 - Tenzin: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You‚Äôre supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*

For eg: In your case, it will be-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*
22/08/23, 14:30 - Rutendo EWYL22E0574: Okay
22/08/23, 14:38 - Tenzin: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
22/08/23, 14:38 - Tenzin: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
22/08/23, 15:06 - Rutendo EWYL22E0574: Alright thank you
22/08/23, 15:33 - Tenzin: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
22/08/23, 19:41 - Tenzin: We will continue in the next session.
25/08/23, 13:52 - Rutendo EWYL22E0574: I am a Proud Edoofian
25/08/23, 13:52 - Tenzin: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!

29/08/23, 13:10 - Rutendo EWYL22E0574: My weekend was quite busy I was booked for housecall hairdos for the whole weekend I only got to relax for a bit on Sunday in the evening and yesterday, Monday.
19/11/22, 04:25 - Rutendo EWYL22E0574: Greetings.
I am a Proud Edoofian.
19/11/22, 04:26 - Tenzin: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

17/12/22, 17:47 - Tenzin: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

17/12/22, 21:47 - Tenzin: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special ‚Äî the receiver‚Äôs happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver‚Äôs eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, 
_I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?_

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!
17/12/22, 21:52 - Rutendo EWYL22E0574: Alright then, understood.
