15/07/22, 17:51 - Pride EWYL20E0288: What I learnt about Patrick

I understood that he was ambitious and a hard worker. When wanting to do something he never doubted him self even though the odds were not In favour of him.
I also learnt that when in business it's not how big the company is but how the finances are managed makes the business to grow.

I also liked how he changed his career completely from being a lawyer into mining industry. How he got into mining was also amazing, being a lawyer was just a stepping stone it gave him money so that he could venture into mining.

A lesson from Him that I learnt is that as long a you are passionate about doing something you can do it, you first need to aquire the knowledge to do what you want to do and then you are good to go

21/07/22, 13:54 - Pride EWYL20E0288: Last weekend activity 

The Fast growing business industry in my Country

Agriculture industry

Agriculture is the backbone of Zimbabwe's economy since most people from rural areas are doing it.

It provide employment to half of Zimbabwe's population. Long ago people used to do Agriculture for family consumption only and even the commercial farmers did not have enough knowledge on how to make their farms more productive, hence they were producing lower outputs. but now as times are changing and our country is slowly developing and learning more about technology 

Agriculture is starting to pay off. Zimbabwe Agriculture market is increasing due to rapidly increasing tourism, increase in consumption and the increase of advanced technology.

 The fastest growing agricultural industry is Hoticulture. It is enjoying a phenomenal growth and raking in millions of foreign currency to the country. Last year horticulture exports grew by 6,8% 

This industry is set to rise much higher as New farmers and foreign investors are pitching in. 

The weekness of the industry is because of Zimbabwe's high cost of production and and difficult economic operating environment. 

The strength are because of new advanced technology, new investors and definitely much bigger land for Agriculture. 

As foreign investors are pitching in there are now lot of opportunities to export agricultural products on the global market.
21/07/22, 13:54 - Pride EWYL20E0288: Wednesday session 



I understood that one should be careful on how to use his words. and that blaming others or the economy for your failure is just an excuse for not making an effort.

Successful people learn and take responsibility when they fail. If you tell yourself that failure is inevitable it will be a prophecy come true for you.

I understood that in order for us to be successful we should have a positive mind. and if we fail we should not just give up but should do something about it so that we can move forward

This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

08/08/22, 22:55 - Pride EWYL20E0288: The secrets of Gilbert's success and the traits that made him successful


Gilbert got his first job just after completing his ordinary level and also did part time job of installing satellite dishes.

By this I can say that he was a hard worker. And he was someone who was full of confidence and believed in himself. That's because he got a job as an assistant at internet cafe by showing his knowledge and capabilities.
Also he was someone who was organized and had a vision, and someone who knew that in order to grow big you need more hands in your business and hence he employed 2 more people in his part time job when he saw that it was on demand.
 doing all of this was just a start up for him as his vision was to one of the biggest media companies.

His secret to have the start up capital was building relationships as he did not want to get a loan with collateral. So he built relationships to open doors for opportunities that also benefited his circle of friends.
What made him successful was to identify the right people to partner with and sometimes he preferred going Solo when he faced wrong partners

That's what I understood made him successful
08/08/22, 22:55 - Pride EWYL20E0288: I think my weekend activity can cover it all sir
08/08/22, 23:03 - Pride EWYL20E0288: Gilbert Eugene
Inspired me to also be a hard worker and make money in the field that you love. He also taught me the difference between family, friends and the right partners in business. I understood that in order to be successful you should not make the mistake of choosing wrong partners to work with. Also l learnt that in business you start small then grow as time goes and your hands alone can not make you more money. You need to have a team in order for your business to grow
08/08/22, 23:09 - Unknown: Wonderful Pride.
08/08/22, 23:09 - Unknown: Let me go through them and Get back to you.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
