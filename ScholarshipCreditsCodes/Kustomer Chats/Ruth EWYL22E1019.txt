21/07/23, 16:37 - Ruth EWYL22E1019: The lesson was on student leadership. I learnt that student leaders emerge as informal leaders who showcase their leadership qualities through their actions and involvement in different activities in their community.
Also to be an influencial student leader one needs to be dedicated, to have passion and commitment to make a positive impact in the community.
I also learnt the key strategies of becoming an influencial student leader. The key strategies include one to lead by example showcasing the integrity and kindness to others and people will follow those same qualities you demonstrate.
Secondly one has to build relationships with others in your community and your peers. Creating a sense of belonging with them offering help when it's needed and also being genuine with others.
Thirdly one must have effective communication. Communication goes both ways so one must make sure he/she must clearly state what they want to say and must listen attentively to what others have to say.
Going on one must learn to empower other peers. Giving them courage to reach their full potential in making a positive impact in their live and their community. This can be y by offering mentorship assistance and guidance whenever it's needed.
Also one must take initiative. This can be done by identifying the areas which need improvement in the community. Then address them or get to imply them with members in your community. This will motivate others.
Some of the key strategies involve embracing diversity ànd inclusion, serving the community and continuously learning and growing.
I learnt that being a leader is not about seeking power or recognition but it's about making a genuine impact and inspiring a positive change.
21/07/23, 16:44 - Unknown: I wholeheartedly agree and appreciate your thoughtful reflection on the lesson about student leadership. It's evident that you have gained a comprehensive understanding of the qualities and strategies needed to become an influential student leader.

I understood that boat is an electronics brand which specializes in audio devices and accessories. Boat is highly recognised in a highly competitive market because of its remarkable growth. Aman Gupta managed to turn his vision of boat into a household name because of his inception on the idea of producing quality audio devices that cater for the budget conscious consumers.  So to be successful  one must produce products that cater for everyone.
Also on his market penetration and branding he faced difficulties but with the help if his team they came up with a market strategy focusing on online platforms and social media because of this a strong brand identity was discovered. So one must use the market penetration strategy and this can be done by teamwork with the other workers helping out. Also online platforms and social media can be the best way to attain consumers.
Moving on his emphasis on  research and development lead to his success. He invested in talented engineers and designers. Which lead to a diverse range of products like earphones and speakers. One must conduct a research on whatever product one needs to produce so that development will be good. He also focused on collaborations with celebrities from various domains like music, sports and entertainment as brand ambassadors.
I was inspired by this story for I am an aspiring entrepreneur. Hoping to identify the market gap and offer my dedication to producing quality products for the people.
28/07/23, 16:11 - Unknown: I'm thrilled to hear that you found inspiration from the success story of Boat and Aman Gupta! It's evident that you've gained valuable insights from their journey, and you're already applying those lessons to your aspirations as an aspiring entrepreneur.
