12/07/22, 17:44 - Lisa EWYL21E0941: The skills or practices that a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits are 1. Discipline into consistency, discipline takes people far and it’s hard to be consistently disciplined and it takes a lot of hard work to rely on discipline to accomplish what you know you should do therefore as students we should be consistently disciplined in order to archive more in life. Another skill is diligence, as students we should not get tired or bored with tasks and projects we should have that diligence in us to help us continue and work hard. Willingness to show up for our sessions and performance in our weakly activities is another skill that we should have. As Edoofians we should also practice the daily ritual of sending the proud Edoofian message to our mentors. By performing the skills and practices above and more I’m sure one would qualify to get to work on a project with skoops.

12/07/22, 19:00 - Unknown: Lisa, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.
This way you will always be recognized by the Academics Board for new projects.
12/07/22, 19:00 - Unknown: Great!
We will discuss these projects one by one today, okay?
12/07/22, 19:01 - Unknown: Lisa, May I know if you are in active conversation with any school regarding Project 3?

12/07/22, 21:34 - Lisa EWYL21E0941: Dear Principal,

I am a proud Edoofian (student of the famed Edoofa program) and I am sincerely reaching out to you about an exceptional opportunity to make a difference in our society.
Edoofa Scholarship Program is run by the decade-old, India headquartered social, for-profit education services organization, Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
They solve the problem of Accessibility, Affordability, and Employability in Higher Education by enabling students to get quality College Education through a Scholarship and work-study program where students like myself get a scholarship to study our dream programs and simultaneously work on live digital projects to learn the 21st-century job skills that are needed to succeed in the digital economy.
The Edoofa Program is bridging the gap between Financial Aid, College Education, and Employability.
The program receives in excess of 20000 applications annually from all across the world for enrollment into the program and has in the past 3.5 years helped more than 2000 African, South East Asian Students successfully pursue Globally accredited degree programs on 50-100 percent scholarship on tuition fee and also get skilled alongside their programs through their earn while you learn program.
I am attaching my Edoofa acceptance letter that highlights my scholarship to pursue my college program soon. I have also started working on projects to improve my skills. One of the projects I am working on is a research & development project to help improve the education infrastructure and facilities of the schools in our region.
The Edoofa program in its efforts to give back to society and also to create an ecosystem of high-quality schools to be transformed into Centres of Excellence is looking at doing Non-Commercial Tie-ups to educate our schools to adopt the best practices and technologies that have helped Indian schools to churn out the best minds in the world.

12/07/22, 22:13 - Unknown: So can you tell me according to you, what is wrong with this kind of communication, or what could be done better?
12/07/22, 22:16 - Lisa EWYL21E0941: I am not sure but I think if I could make constant trips to the schools so as to ensure that they get the message it could work 
I don’t know if it’s a good idea
12/07/22, 22:21 - Unknown: Well, the answer lies in the way you keep up the conversation. 
Let us suppose if I am reaching out to you for the very first time, do I share everything about the EWYL projects and introduce myself in a blunt manner, or do I first introduce myself, ask you about your availability and then keep the conversation interactive while explaining the projects?
12/07/22, 22:23 - Lisa EWYL21E0941: I introduce myself self first and keep the conversation going

The deadline to make the submission is *Thursday* *6 PM*. Please make sure that you submit your response before that because the *Academic Board* keeps a very strict check on these things. 
 
The aim of this activity is to make you aware of the life journey of Patrice Motsepe and how you can inculcate his traits in your daily life.

I would want you to follow the points given below:
◼️Make sure that you follow the Proud Edoofian ritual (Even on Sunday?)
◼️Keep an eye on the Saturday Activity that will be shared in your batch group
◼️Also, If you haven't submitted the Wednesday Lesson yet, Please make sure that you submit it as soon as possible.
◼️I would like to you work diligently on the EWYL Projects and submit your Project Progress Form in our next scheduled session.

I wish you a blessed and a joyful weekend ahead✨

25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
