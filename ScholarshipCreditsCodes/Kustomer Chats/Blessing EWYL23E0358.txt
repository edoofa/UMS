11/09/23, 13:30 - Blessing EWYL23E0358: Continuous assessment is a form of educational examination that evaluates a student's progress throughout a prescribed course. It is often used as an alternative to the final examination system.

Continuous Assessment is a learning strategy evaluation that assesses learners' development or performance during the course of a programme.

This is done to avoid relying solely on tests at the conclusion of the academic term. 

Continuous assessment may include tests, assignments, projects, laboratory work, field exercises, presentations and other forms of classroom participation.

 Continuous assessment means assessing aspects of learners' language throughout their course and then producing a final evaluation result from these assessments. It can be compared with a final or summative assessment, which only assesses the learner at the end of the course.
Continuous assessment refers to an evaluation process that involves ongoing monitoring and feedback on a regular basis throughout a course or program. This can involve various methods, such as regular quizzes or tests, homework assignments, essays, and class participation.
11/09/23, 13:31 - Ananya: It is an alternative to final examinations?
11/09/23, 13:31 - Blessing EWYL23E0358: Yes ma'am
