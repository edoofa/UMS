25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

04/08/22, 17:44 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0671: The major takeaways from the Wednesday wisdom lesson was you do not need to start big to become an entrepreneur, and it doesn't always go the way we want to go but perseverance is the key. Mr Gilbert had to suffer through a lot like separation from friends but that did not stop him from building an empire and above all when one decides to do something, he\/she should be able to be surrounded by people who will support them despite tge challenges

Good day my proud Edoofian!! How are you today?
04/08/22, 19:51 - Unknown: Simbarashe,  Good to read your understanding of the lesson Edoofian. The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years. The price is knowing that time is working on your side even when the results don’t show it, yet.
04/08/22, 22:53 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0671: Halo sir I am ok
04/08/22, 22:54 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0671: Ok sir am learning
05/08/22, 00:42 - Unknown: You see Simbarashe,  lack of consistency keeps ordinary people from achieving extraordinary results. Excelling at the small choices that compound over time perpetually leaves you in favorable circumstances. No matter what happens in the world, you’re never in a position where you are forced into a bad decision.
05/08/22, 17:54 - Unknown: Good day Simbarashe! Please send \"I am a proud Edoofian' chant for the day.

Happy New week edoofian! How was your weekend?
11/08/22, 22:07 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:33 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well.

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off
