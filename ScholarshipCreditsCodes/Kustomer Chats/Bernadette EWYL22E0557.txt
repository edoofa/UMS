01/10/22, 18:02 - Tenzin: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

02/10/22, 00:00 - Bernadette EWYL22E0557: There is a  powercut  now I will reference the links once  restored
02/10/22, 20:50 - Bernadette EWYL22E0557: With reference to the links you shared of the Multi media House (Online Africa Global radio)
I understood their vision of changing Africa's narrative by  pushing and promoting, inspiring and empowering stories of Global Africa by using authentic positive narratives on Africa and African Diaspora to contribute to transformational change.
It seems part of the strategy is working  by engaging and collaborating with African students all over the world. 
African Global Radio and Edoofa are increasing employability skills of African students  by bridging the gap between industry and academia  by giving them real life exposure to the world of work.Edoofa students from a digital marketing point of view, offer great value to social media branding by increasing engagement through ambassadorial and promotional work which attracts new online users .
