It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

03/10/22, 03:50 - MOYO EWYL22E0599: Yes i do agree with this one, there are some of the things that you need to achieve through hardwork ,appreciation and certain skills for example being a lawyer needs a person who is ready and prepared for the hardworking process and you cannot achieve it through bribes in which you will be lacking some of the skills.
03/10/22, 03:54 - MOYO EWYL22E0599: And also this one is an inspirational quote.
I totally agree with it because if you do hasty shortcuts you wont reach your goals as planned but you become a failure at the end In which if you work hard ,every dream  come true in no time just because of hardworking.
03/10/22, 03:54 - MOYO EWYL22E0599: Yes, most of the times what you expected becomes the vise vesa of it.What i mean is ,shortcuts are never easy and they will never be because they need a lot of things for example money for doing whatever it is that somebody wants.

06/10/22, 18:43 - MOYO EWYL22E0599: Good morning ma'am
How are you doing today?


The Wednesday wisdom for this week helps us as Edoofian students to grow by pausing and reflecting on what we are good at and what we need to improve.There are some tips that helps us as students to prioritize the important things without neglecting the less important ones.
Step 1 states that a student shoukd set a vision in which it brings the sense of utilizing our time and also reminds us to spend our time on things that moves us closer to our vision .

Step 2 advises us as proud Edoofians to create a master list which is a list of tasks to be done at a particular day and time .It also gives out a picture of what our day is going to be look like and reminds us if what has to be done during the day.

Step 3 also mentions the productive cycle meaning that everyone has their preferable time of the day where they have a lot of energy and focus .

Step 4 talks about the leverage people which means that  as a person you have to believe in other peoples's visions an support them so that they can help you .

Step 5 selecting of your activities as a student in which you have to make sure that the tasks you do during the day has to be useful and has to take you closer to your vision and guide you to achieve it .

This is what I have understood ma'am.

How are you?
06/10/22, 20:14 - Saloni Rastogi: As students, we constantly learn and expose ourselves to situations that help us learn anything and everything, but we must remember that each of us has the same number of hours in a day. Hence we must treat it important that we treat our Time as the currency of life. *Time Management* is essentially Priority Management.

In our session today on the *EWYL Line*, we will discuss:
1. How managing time is necessary

How are you?
14/10/22, 21:31 - Saloni Rastogi: We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In the session on the EWYL Line, we will:
1) discuss on the Wednesday lesson
2) video to be shared as a part of the weekend activity
