28/12/23, 16:16 - Blessing EWYL23E0729: A story about the first New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square? Back in 1904, there was a big celebration planned in Times Square to welcome the new year. But there was a problem - the lights on the Times Square Ball weren't working! The organizers were frantic, and they didn't know what to do. Just then, a young boy named Billy came running up. He offered to help fix the lights, and the organizers gratefully accepted. Billy worked quickly and soon had the lights shining brightly. The crowd cheered as the ball dropped, and  Billy was lifted up on the shoulders of the crowd and carried around Times Square. Everyone cheered for him and thanked him for saving the celebration. Billy was so happy, and he knew that he had done something special. From that day on, Billy was known as the "Hero of Times Square." Every year, on New Year's Eve, people remember Billy and his bravery. And the Times Square Ball still shines brightly, thanks to Billy's quick thinking. üòä
28/12/23, 16:28 - Ananya: Time up!‚è∞

11/01/24, 13:39 - Ananya: A lovely morning to you, and kindly excuse me for the short delay. I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.
Not only this, but we also welcomed various industrial leaders, and it went super well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we teach them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. I hope that whenever you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/01/24, 13:44 - Blessing EWYL23E0729: Well interesting, its a thing that will enhance support us a Edoofian to move forward with great hope
11/01/24, 14:00 - Ananya: Indeed, Blessing! Let me share a few glimpses of the event with you!
11/01/24, 14:00 - Ananya: .
11/01/24, 14:05 - Blessing EWYL23E0729: It sounds interesting to be an Edoofian
11/01/24, 14:39 - Ananya: Indeed! Now, I know it took me some extra time to find the pictures for you, and our session could not take place. We shall now resume our session on Monday. Meanwhile, I want you to follow your EWYL ritual daily so that you can receive the weekend activity.
Not only this, but since this week is completely off for you, I want to know your progress with your projects. You know, seeing over 400 students in this event has motivated me to work for my students even harder. I want you to be here in India and pay your fee all by yourself. For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed for a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?
11/01/24, 14:44 - Blessing EWYL23E0729: Thank you for your support madam and well noted with thanks
