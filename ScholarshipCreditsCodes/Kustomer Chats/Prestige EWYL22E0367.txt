It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

How are you doing?

As students, we constantly learn and expose ourselves to situations that help us learn anything and everything, but we must remember that each of us has the same number of hours in a day. Hence we must treat it important that we treat our Time as the currency of life. *Time Management* is essentially Priority Management.

In our session today on the *EWYL Line*, we will discuss:
1. How managing time is necessary
06/10/22, 19:53 - Unknown: Along with this, please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'.
06/10/22, 20:51 - Unknown: I completely get that you might be facing some difficulties under IndianDoc, but I think we can work on it. If nothing works, we will surely find a solution for it.
Don't worry.

08/10/22, 04:01 - Prestige EWYL22E0367: Okay
08/10/22, 04:23 - Prestige EWYL22E0367: Okay ma'am ...During my study of the Wednesday wisdom I learnt that through social media networking and exploring one can gain confidence to stand in front of the camera ,can learn story telling technique,you become digital literacy which teaches children how to run successful businesses online and also I got inspired by Ms Yasmin's story I am actually one of the people who haven't started enjoying the feeling of being away from home but I really got inspired into exploring and taking advantage of the opportunity that I have to do something productive
08/10/22, 04:30 - Prestige EWYL22E0367: I am also curious to know how the other students like Wandile ,Tapiwa and Tapiwa had to get such high scholarship credits while I am struggling with the projects... Like the projects are too difficult for me ...The issue of approaching people is not a problem but the problem comes with how those people take that ...it's really hard to convince people... I have been receiving bad views from a lot of people which is wearing out my patience... But maybe if you can give me projects that have nothing to do with people I can assure you I would really appreciate it... Because ma'am I also want to be like those successful students who were able to fund for their education... My parents sent me here especially for that so if I fail to do it I will be a big disappointment to them...May you kindly help me

How are you?
09/10/22, 16:30 - Unknown: Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. Those unfamiliar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.
Responses will be accepted on the *EWYL Line* only.
_Till then keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'_.

Happy learning and enjoy your weekend!

But what I am concerned about is our scholarship target for this month that you have set, how are we going to achieve that?
We need to plan that and work on it from today onwards.
I don't expect any late back attitude from you, I want to work very hard for you but it will only fructify when you will put equivalent and solid efforts into that.

First, keep sharing the link of the group in their family groups, class groups, and school groups, with the children who stay nearby, and, try to circulate all around.
Second, once new people get added to the group, they are told about Edoofa and it the perks of being associated with it.
Third, they share the community building form with them and then children fill out the form and share it with the group.

What do you think about this?
