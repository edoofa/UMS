I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.
Our sessions are on Tuesday and Friday from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM
25/05/23, 13:15 - Joseph EWYL22E1200: Great

01/07/23, 11:20 - Joseph EWYL22E1200: Good morning Ms Ananya its a great pleasure to meet with you on a warm Saturday morning unfortunately today i was called for work but I've put my effort to read and to summarize about the 21 days challenge before i dash to work

All i read was about the 21 days challenge where every day i must impress my mentor by attending all sessions during Wednesdays and Saturdays with due determination and dedication and on top of it punctuality.
But this is not all we'll have to stand out side to show case out talents on extracurricular activities and take opportunity to shine and impress the mentor
This will help use to grow stronger and equip us to withstand challenges in life
01/07/23, 12:15 - Aditi Kapoor: I understand Joseph! However, You have to be regular with your sessions twice a week according to your previous session timings!
