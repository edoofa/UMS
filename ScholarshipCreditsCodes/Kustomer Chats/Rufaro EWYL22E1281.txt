23/10/23, 13:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Please note that I won't be available today due to some personal commitments. On Tuesday, our services will not be operational as we will be observing Dussehra, an exciting Indian festival celebrated with grand effigies, fireworks, and vibrant processions that symbolize the victory of good over evil. 🎉 Dussehra is a dazzling spectacle of lights, dances, and traditions that bring families and communities together while also paying tribute to the epic triumph of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana. 🏹🔥
23/10/23, 13:47 - Saloni Rastogi: Dussehra is a Hindu festival with its origins in India, celebrating the victory of good over evil. It is not directly linked to African festivals but shares the universal theme of triumph over malevolence. In diverse African communities, individuals from India or other regions may celebrate Dussehra alongside local festivities, fostering cultural exchange. Immigrants from India in Africa often continue to observe Dussehra, occasionally sharing these traditions with their local communities. While not intrinsically connected, Dussehra's theme of celebrating virtue resonates with the broader notion of triumph over evil found in various African festivals.

I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
14/03/23, 17:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
14/03/23, 17:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM*

14/03/23, 21:36 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead tomorrow.

We will discuss the difference between wealth, money, and status, and how each of these concepts plays a role in our lives.

By understanding the importance of seeking wealth over money or status, you can develop a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial success. I look forward to exploring this topic with you in more detail during our upcoming lesson.

Happy learning!","transform":"

How are you?
Please share your understanding on the Wednesday lesson so that we can soon discuss about the PROJECTS.
17/03/23, 22:18 - Rufaro EWYL22E1281: Good afternoon ma'am
17/03/23, 22:18 - Rufaro EWYL22E1281: Im sorry for the delay, we have network problems
17/03/23, 22:19 - Rufaro EWYL22E1281: I learnt that wealth can provide a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial stability
17/03/23, 22:20 - Rufaro EWYL22E1281: It was interesting to learn that wealth means having assets while you sleep
17/03/23, 22:21 - Rufaro EWYL22E1281: Lastly I understood that by focusing on generating assets that can generate passive income, you can create a steady stream of income which will sustain a person in the long run
17/03/23, 22:33 - Saloni Rastogi: You have concluded the understanding of the lesson so well. Even my learning has been that 'Money is simply a tool that we use to transfer time and wealth, and that status is not a measure of true success or happiness. Instead, focus on building wealth and creating a life that brings you joy and fulfillment.' 
And you know _earning scholarship credits_ is just parallel to creating that joy and fulfillment and aiming higher by seeing how much you have earned and beating all the records.
17/03/23, 22:33 - Saloni Rastogi: Did you get the contact details of the Headmaster that we last discussed?
17/03/23, 22:58 - Rufaro EWYL22E1281: Yes ma'am
17/03/23, 23:03 - Saloni Rastogi: It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
17/03/23, 23:03 - Saloni Rastogi: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
17/03/23, 23:04 - Saloni Rastogi: So, This is what the First message should look like:
17/03/23, 23:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Mr.\/Mrs *School Head Name*

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result\/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
17/03/23, 23:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Once they tell the time, do let me know.
17/03/23, 23:06 - Rufaro EWYL22E1281: I promise
17/03/23, 23:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Till that time, try to look for other heads' contact details also.
17/03/23, 23:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me share with you how our star performer for last week-Loice did complete her targets.
She shared three schools and you know she got to know about them through Google.
She simply searched on Google like 'School nearby'\/'School in Harare'\/'School in Manicaland' and so on. She was able to yield result. 
So even without physically visiting them, she got to know about them through Google, got heir contact details and after that got in touch with them Via WhatsApp.
17/03/23, 23:09 - Rufaro EWYL22E1281: Ok ma'am
17/03/23, 23:09 - Rufaro EWYL22E1281: Wow
17/03/23, 23:09 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, get their contact, and share the introduction message with them as well.
Once they revert back, share this information with them that I am sharing with you.
17/03/23, 23:10 - Saloni Rastogi: The information that I am sharing now might be a lot of information at once, so try to grasp it slowly and in case you have any concerns, let me know.
17/03/23, 23:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education   All.
17/03/23, 23:10 - Saloni Rastogi: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of lack of affordability and of employability in higher education. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!
17/03/23, 23:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Edoofa is a social for-profit organization that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!
17/03/23, 23:11 - Saloni Rastogi: Edoofa scholarship program is currently helping over 100 schools in Africa, and over 3000 African students are benefiting from our scholarship program. The school principals and teachers who are playing a significant role in our program are enjoying exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Now, to help the students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation, Edoofa has its own Earn While You Learn Program, which helps the students to learn skills and earn money in the form of scholarship credits to reduce their expenses.
17/03/23, 23:11 - Saloni Rastogi: Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his\/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. With the quality of education provided to the student completing high school, edoofa would want to transform your school’s every student into a person who’s so strong in the knowledge that he\/she becomes better than his\/her peers. Coupled with the Earn While you Learn program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he\/she has got more opportunities to chase him\/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development\/growth.
17/03/23, 23:12 - Saloni Rastogi: Now, It is time to explain with examples How Edoofa is revolutionizing the Education System on the African Continent. Examples create clarity. This is why they are used in all contexts as a tool to provide further understanding. When it comes to your conversation, examples play a significant role in your ability to effectively communicate the elements that you want the School Head to understand.
17/03/23, 23:12 - Saloni Rastogi: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

_United College of Education_, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and _Respected Sir Adam Luthuli_ has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

18/03/23, 20:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings *my proud edoofian*!

Here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!
18/03/23, 20:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Did you contacts from Google like I shared with you?

04/04/23, 01:32 - Saloni Rastogi: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

How are you?
04/04/23, 03:17 - Saloni Rastogi: You know we had an amazing time visiting our proud Edoofians here in our partner Universities.
During our visits, I had the pleasure of meeting with students from different countries and cultures. We discussed various topics ranging from academic opportunities, EWYL Projects, and future career prospects and beyond this, an interpersonal bond that I have with all my students. It was a great opportunity for us to exchange ideas and experiences, and we were impressed by the level of enthusiasm and curiosity among the students.
