b)How many projects can you work upon
c)Number of hours that you can devote to your projects
d)Name of the projects that you want to be a part of
e)Plan of action with your mentors

So we know, a lot of you have been keeping busy these days with your exams and academic curriculum. And while we wish you all the luck for it, we don't want you to miss out on your learning and skill building. In today's lesson, we will discuss how to build our capacity to multitask, manage our time and prioritize our daily tasks in order to have it all. 

Let's dig right in, and understand how if you follow these steps, you will be able to manage your exams, assignments, extra curriculars, and your EWYL projects all at one go. After going through this, you must discuss the plan of action to execute these steps with your mentors.

Happy Learning!

07/10/22, 21:09 - Unknown: *Check this out, this is the response I received by one of my students and I am expecting the same out of you*
What I have learnt so far is that there are steps that will help me in managing my exams, assignment, extracurricular and ewyl projects at one go.the first step is to set a vision and it gives me a mind of finding a practical use for my time efficiently.always remembering the bigger picture and spending time on things that move closer to my vision. Secondly is to create a masterlist daily where I will be listing tasks to be done on that particular day and it gives me a picture of what my day is going to look like and remembering all that needed to be done. Thirdly is to find my productive cycle by finding the time of the day when I have a huge amount of focus and energy and start executing the most important task . Lastly is leveraging people, I have to delegate my tasks and make best use of resources available and it helps me increase my work efficiency. I have to believe in others vision and support them to interchange and help me
08/10/22, 01:15 - Hazel EWYL21E0838: Good day Ms Riva

I am checking on that

14/07/22, 00:55 - Unknown: Along with your today's task please submit the followers.
14/07/22, 15:30 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian!
14/07/22, 16:07 - Hazel EWYL21E0838: I am a proud Edoofian
14/07/22, 16:07 - Hazel EWYL21E0838: Good morning Ms Riva
14/07/22, 16:08 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
