03/11/22, 05:58 - Shalom EWYL21E0270: Greetings Mr Anadi, l am Shalom Chibondo and l am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL grop name is Shalom EWYL21E0270
03/11/22, 15:35 - Shalom EWYL21E0270: l am a proud Edoofian
03/11/22, 15:36 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
03/11/22, 15:57 - Shalom EWYL21E0270: Thank you
03/11/22, 16:06 - Shalom EWYL21E0270: Thank you
03/11/22, 21:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Shalom! Are you ready for your session?
03/11/22, 21:15 - Shalom EWYL21E0270: greetings sir,

yes l am
03/11/22, 21:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Great! So let me share yesterday's lesson with you, I want you to go through it and then we can begin our discussions.
03/11/22, 21:17 - Shalom EWYL21E0270: noted sir
03/11/22, 21:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian,
``
We all have come across the quote, \"Quitters Never Win, and Winners Never Quit\", and we also must have experienced this in our lives, directly or indirectly.
``
If last week's lesson, taught you the mindset of a winner, this week's lesson is going to teach you the true nature of a winner. Someone, who never gives up, or quits on the dream they see and really want to fulfill, no matter what. Moving through scorching heat, drenching rains, and heavy snow, they reach their destination and complete their journey. In this lesson, you will also learn, what happens when an entire community inherits this trait and keeps working on it. How recognition is earned and respect is gained through time, patience, and endless efforts.
``
I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.
03/11/22, 21:30 - Shalom EWYL21E0270: am done listening to the
 audio sir
03/11/22, 21:41 - Saloni Rastogi: Great! So can you please share your understanding of the same with me?
03/11/22, 21:54 - Shalom EWYL21E0270: Winners never give up. Taking Mr Shantaram Siddi as an example when he was a kid his hunger of knowledge made him get recognised and it never stopped there he also realised that only a few people get an opportunity that he got and he made a promise to himself that he has to help the community get the recognition that they deserve. More so l should discuss the challenges and roadblocks am facing with my mentor and find solutions to them in order to do well and make me and my community proud
03/11/22, 22:16 - Saloni Rastogi: I am really happy with your understanding Shalom! So, can you please share with me the problems which you think you have been facing till now, and that can act as a barrier in your EWYL Projects, so that we can work on them.
03/11/22, 22:33 - Shalom EWYL21E0270: As of now am facing problems with my network though its happening across the country and electricity failures thats all at the moment
03/11/22, 23:14 - Saloni Rastogi: That involves an entirely different department and has nothing to do with you so we can pass this one. Apart from that, are you clear with the projects we are going to work on, because we shall be planning our projects now.
03/11/22, 23:14 - Shalom EWYL21E0270: yes sir l am very clear with them
03/11/22, 23:20 - Saloni Rastogi: Great! Since Shalom, we know that it is really important for a person to be able to create some targets for themselves and plan their strategy accordingly. So I want you to set specific targets for yourself regarding the Projects, that is the numbers that you shall be trying to achieve in this week., and share it with me, we shall then plan our approach towards it, and then try fulfilling those targets.
03/11/22, 23:33 - Shalom EWYL21E0270: Creating a Linkdln account and get everything in place in order to start working.
Creating a whatsapp group for serious students who want to be part of the program.
Try to get contacts of different principals and headmasters through these students from different schools
03/11/22, 23:49 - Saloni Rastogi: And what would be your target for a week, like, how many schools would you try to connect with, how many companies, and how many students you shall reach out to?
03/11/22, 23:51 - Shalom EWYL21E0270: At least 4-5 school, companies 2-3 and 10 students per week
04/11/22, 00:00 - Saloni Rastogi: Great! But is it the target you know you can achieve, or you want to achieve?
04/11/22, 00:02 - Shalom EWYL21E0270: lts the target l want to achieve
04/11/22, 00:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Great! So, let's try achieving it week by week.
04/11/22, 00:50 - Shalom EWYL21E0270: yes sir am ready
04/11/22, 00:51 - Saloni Rastogi: I want you to dedicate one hour of your daily schedule to research about companies and schools, and meanwhile, keep connecting with other students.
04/11/22, 00:52 - Shalom EWYL21E0270: noted with thanks sir
04/11/22, 00:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Please share it ASAP.
04/11/22, 00:54 - Saloni Rastogi: The list you have created of Targets, in a systematic form.
04/11/22, 00:56 - Shalom EWYL21E0270: sir am not understanding what you mean
04/11/22, 01:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Send me a list of targets you have created for yourself in a week.

05/11/22, 21:43 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian!

“My job is not to be easy on people. My job is to make them better.”- Steve Jobs

And till now, our founder Mr. Angad has always been a guiding light for everyone at Edoofa. And has made sure we all turn out to be future leaders in our fields, no matter how hard it seems, we should keep moving with single harmony toward our goals and motives. But, leadership can not only be taught, as it is not a literary subject, but a practical life experience that is to be taken up and practiced and bettered with each passing day.

Hence, after the very encouraging Wednesday lesson on how good leadership and patience can change the entire ideology and perception of a community to grow back from the ashes. Today's Activity is going to give you a first-hand experience to fit yourselves in a small part of the leadership shoes. I want you to create a newsletter of your own. Similar to the ones you have enjoyed reading every Sunday from the founder's office.

Your Newsletter should consider the following things:  Quotes that have been motivating you for some time now, or your three favorite quotes which motivate you to be better every day.
and,
2. One story of your idol, that can be any person, who according to you has contributed to making the community and world a better place for people to live. The story should also consist of a part stating the reason why they are your idol.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own capabilities while performing this activity.

The best newsletters of the week shall be shared with all the fellow edoofians next week.

Have a wonderful weekend ahead.
05/11/22, 22:11 - Saloni Rastogi: The deadline for the submission of this newsletter is 12 pm Zimbabwe Time Monday.

3 Quotes for you

1) Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time. \"Thomas. A. Edison\"

2) Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.

3) ln order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure.

l came across a great figure in Network Marketing \"Erick Wore\". He started Network Marketing at the age of 23 years old and selling real estate for a small company owned by his father. During the process he got involved into shortcuts for making money and by luck it worked but didn't last for long and his Network Marketing income dried right up.  When it turned up his positive attitude completely went away and started blaming everyone and everything. His upline wasn't giving enough help. When he realised that blaming the world wasn't going to change anything and pay his bills, he then took action for his future and business.

Even though he got to rebuild his organization over and over again and it still crashed he was more that discouraged. He had almost lost hope but quiting never came across his mind.
ln order to become an \"Expert\" one should decide to become experienced, learn everything they could, read every book, talk to every other person in the field you want to be part of and learn it so completely focusing on the skills and practicing.

09/11/22, 23:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian,

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.

10/11/22, 12:40 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
