04/04/23, 21:08 - Bervely EWYL22E1332: Okay noted

04/04/23, 21:08 - Ananya: Now can you tell me which project do you find most interesting and fit for you to start with?
04/04/23, 21:09 - Ananya: Awesome!
04/04/23, 21:10 - Ananya: Today we're going to talk about how to find student-centric SMEs in Africa using Google and LinkedIn. Are you familiar with these tools?
04/04/23, 21:10 - Bervely EWYL22E1332: Yes l am
04/04/23, 21:19 - Ananya: Let's start with Google. When you're searching for student-centric SMEs in Africa, what keywords do you think you should use?
04/04/23, 21:29 - Bervely EWYL22E1332: Sorry am not getting what you trying to say please can you enlighten me on that one
04/04/23, 21:41 - Ananya: Are you asking me for SME's?
04/04/23, 21:46 - Bervely EWYL22E1332: Yes
04/04/23, 21:48 - Ananya: African SMEs (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) are businesses with relatively small levels of revenue and employees. They play a critical role in the development of the African economy, contributing to job creation, income generation, and poverty reduction. African SMEs face a number of challenges, including limited access to finance, inadequate infrastructure, and insufficient support from governments and other stakeholders. However, they are also a source of innovation, creativity, and resilience, and have the potential to drive sustainable economic growth and development across the continent.
04/04/23, 21:49 - Ananya: Some examples of African SMEs include:

Kobo360: A Nigerian logistics company that provides a digital platform for trucking services across Africa.

Mama Money: A South African fintech company that enables low-cost cross-border money transfers for migrants and their families.

M-Kopa Solar: A Kenyan renewable energy company that provides solar-powered lighting and charging solutions to rural households and small businesses.

Twiga Foods: A Kenyan agtech company that connects smallholder farmers with retailers through a mobile-based supply chain platform.

Jumia: An e-commerce platform operating in several African countries, offering a range of products and services to consumers and small businesses.

These are just a few examples of the many innovative and impactful SMEs operating across Africa.
04/04/23, 22:00 - Bervely EWYL22E1332: Okay thank you
04/04/23, 22:09 - Ananya: You could also try \"student-centered SMEs in Africa\" or \"African startups focused on education\". Once you have a list of relevant startups, the next step is to find the company officials on LinkedIn. Have you used LinkedIn before?
04/04/23, 22:16 - Bervely EWYL22E1332: Yes l have managed to
04/04/23, 22:22 - Ananya: Do you have the list now?
04/04/23, 22:39 - Bervely EWYL22E1332: Working on that

I was really pleased to see that some of you had a profound understanding of the importance of one's actions and how everyone of us has a duty to use our knowledge to benefit society and preserve the environment. Today’s Saturday activity requires you to wear the hat of an ecopreneur!

You are required to explore the concept of ecopreneurship and investigate prevailing environmental problems in your local community. In your submission,
a. you should focus on identifying the causes and impacts of these problems, and
b. possible solutions to mitigate them.

I will be looking forward to some detailed responses from your end, don’t forget to think like a Leader!
15/04/23, 15:49 - Bervely EWYL22E1332: So l should write down the problems but here ohh
15/04/23, 15:49 - Ananya: Yes
15/04/23, 15:53 - Bervely EWYL22E1332: So the causes are 
Shortage of water in homes
Land pollution an water pollution
Deforrestration
15/04/23, 15:59 - Bervely EWYL22E1332: The solutions are
Drilling of boreholes in communities
People should normalise recycling things rather than littering every where
Since electricity is becoming a challenge many people are cutting down wood  so to reduce that people need to reafforestrate

26/04/23, 16:55 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Last week we learnt about first 6 principles from the book- Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. Today’s Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the remaining principles. Ready to learn in detail?

The book outlines specific principles and strategies that successful people have used to achieve their goals. By following these principles, readers can create a roadmap for their own success. I believe, reading "Think and Grow Rich" can provide readers with the mindset, motivation, and strategies needed to achieve success in any area of life. Let us discuss in detail about your learnings in our upcoming scheduled session. 

Happy Learning
