I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
17/01/23, 19:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
17/01/23, 19:42 - Saloni Rastogi: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:
Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM.*

19/01/23, 20:55 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

20/01/23, 17:56 - Caroline EWYL22E0709: I did not get you
21/01/23, 21:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

A college student named Rachel was unsure of what career path to pursue after graduation. She talked to several professionals in different fields, but none of them seemed to fit her interests and skills. One day, she had a conversation with a mentor who asked her the right questions, such as \"What are you passionate about?\" and \"What do you enjoy doing in your free time?\" Rachel realized that her true passion was writing and storytelling. She decided to pursue a career in journalism and landed a job at a top news outlet.

We gained knowledge on how to ask intelligent questions. I'd like you to share with us any two questions you'd like to ask yourself as part of your Saturday submission. The questions that you may have been hesitant to make, the questions that put you in a difficult situation, the inquiries that will have a significant impact on your career and future. For example:  1. What is the limit of my current capabilities and how can I push beyond them to continue learning and growing?\"
2. “How can I ensure that my actions align with my values and contribute to the greater good, rather than just maximizing my own success?\"

Looking forward to your response!
21/01/23, 21:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Please make a note of the following things:
1) No response will be accepted on the EWYL Group, it has to be done on the EWYL Line only.
2) I believe that you are aware that every morning you wake up, you need to follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' on the EWYL Line only. This ritual helps in keeping the family connected.
3) From now on, you have to reach out to me at your scheduled time of the session. In case you have not shared your activity\/lesson response to be within one hour of your scheduled session, I will mark that as a missed session and just to inform you that such a performance can go to the direct notice of the Academic Board of Edoofa under the defaulters' list. Make sure that you are punctual.

28/01/23, 17:02 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up.

07/04/23, 22:52 - Saloni Rastogi: I completely agree with you and I am happy to see the consistency in your sharing your response.

Let me summarize the lesson for you.
▪️Consistency is the key to success in any aspect of life, and the same applies to a
student's skill development and career growth. 
▪️Firstly, consistency in studies is crucial for a student's academic success. This not only helps students to cover the syllabus in time but also ensures that they have a clear understanding of the concepts. 
▪️Secondly, consistency in practice is vital for developing skills. 
▪️Lastly, consistency in learning is crucial for career growth. 

Consistent studies, practice, and learning are essential for achieving academic success, developing skills, and staying ahead on the job market

How are you?
17/04/23, 15:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you please write the response Caroline?
I can not understand it properly.
17/04/23, 16:40 - Caroline EWYL22E0709: OK Ms Saloni
17/04/23, 16:40 - Caroline EWYL22E0709: I'm good and you
17/04/23, 16:59 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing good, thank you.
Can you please write a response?
I know you have explained it so well in the audio, but I am not able to hear it.
17/04/23, 17:08 - Caroline EWYL22E0709: In my research for the local problem and solutions to the problem that would give me profit at the same time benefiting the society I have discovered that in Glenview 1,Harare we are facing a challenge of disposable nappies being dumped in open areas which is causing land pollution and air pollution from the smell they produce.
I have discovered that the young generation of our area are giving birth at a tender age which is increasing the birth rate. By increasing the birth rate the demand for disposable nappies will increase cause these pollutions to increase as well.
Just like Lorna did, I would also prefer her idea of recycling those nappies  by taking the disposed nappies and clean them removing water-soluble icon and the layer laced inside. 
Taking the outside layer we can produce non-disposable nappies by taking that layer and attach it to a soft clothe so that the baby fills comfortable wearing the nappies.
The core should contain cotton because it is washable and the napping should be able to open so we can attach a zipper on the outside layer so that a mother can get a chance to change the cotton inside.
The nappies should be worn the same way the disposable nappies are worn
By doing this we can reduce land and air pollution and make the place clean
17/04/23, 17:11 - Caroline EWYL22E0709: I have shared what I have thought will be okay because this will increase profits and benefits the society at the same time, I wrote this as an ecopreneur
17/04/23, 17:15 - Caroline EWYL22E0709: And yes the nappies  can be ironed from the inside
17/04/23, 17:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Well, this is one of the most unique answers I have come across.
You have answered it really well, you have identified a big and different problem and you have mentioned one point very apt that people become ignorant of these problems very soon.

We have to make sure that it does not increase and our Earth is still a lovely place to live for our coming generations.🌳
17/04/23, 17:23 - Caroline EWYL22E0709: Really, I wasn't sure if I was making any sense thank you
17/04/23, 17:30 - Saloni Rastogi: No worries, I know you can make sense.
17/04/23, 17:33 - Caroline EWYL22E0709: Thank you Ms Saloni, and yes you were right the land we are living in will also live the future generations so it should be reserved for them to follow what we did

20/04/23, 14:45 - Saloni Rastogi: Dear Proud Edoofian,
