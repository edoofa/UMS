18/05/23, 19:05 - Esnaty EWYL22E1180: The Wednesday lesson talked about leadership.To be a great leader you need particular styles. Servant leadership includes the motive to serve. It's important characteristics may include persuasion and commitment also stewardship
18/05/23, 19:10 - Ananya: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the Wednesday lesson. It is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.

25/05/23, 17:40 - Ananya: A lovely good morning to my Proud Edoofian! 

On this Africa Day, I would like to extend my heartfelt wishes to you. As students, you are the future leaders, innovators, and change-makers who will shape Africa's destiny.ðŸŒŸ

On this special day, let us take a moment to reflect on the achievements and progress that Africa has made, while also acknowledging the challenges that lie ahead. Africa is a land of incredible beauty, resilience, and untapped potential. As students, you have the power to unlock that potential and make a positive impact on your communities, your countries, and the entire continent.âœ¨
25/05/23, 18:24 - Esnaty EWYL22E1180: Sure
25/05/23, 18:25 - Ananya: So, what are your plans for celebrating Africa day today?
25/05/23, 18:29 - Esnaty EWYL22E1180: Im travelling to Harare for the Sunday program
25/05/23, 18:31 - Ananya: That is great, Esnaty! I hope you will have a lot of fun there.
25/05/23, 18:32 - Ananya: Now may I ask if you were able to read the Wednesday lesson?
25/05/23, 18:32 - Esnaty EWYL22E1180: I hope so too
25/05/23, 18:32 - Esnaty EWYL22E1180: Yes
25/05/23, 18:32 - Ananya: Great, would you like to share your thoughts on it?
25/05/23, 18:37 - Esnaty EWYL22E1180: Self awareness really helps us to identify our strengths and weaknesses so that we can build our plans and work towards them carefully also we need not to deviate from our schedule
25/05/23, 18:38 - Ananya: I agree with the sentiment expressed in your statement about self-awareness. Our Wednesday wisdom emphasized the importance of being honest with one's feelings and taking time for self-reflection. For instance, former President Obama dedicated 4-5 hours of his time alone after dinner, which allowed him to delve deeper into self-discovery.
25/05/23, 18:51 - Ananya: Esnaty,I want to emphasize the significance of this session so that you fully understand its importance. I have set aside this specific time slot exclusively for you. It is crucial that you are attentive and responsive during our discussion. Quick and timely replies are essential because if we are not able to communicate efficiently, it may hinder our progress and potentially lead to delays in completing our projects on time.
25/05/23, 19:02 - Ananya: I feel a sense of disappointment regarding today's session, and I have certain expectations for our next session. While I understand that you may have encountered some challenges or issues, I kindly request that you make a sincere effort to be punctual in our future sessions. The next session is going to be a video session on Saturday. I will share the link shorty!
25/05/23, 19:28 - Esnaty EWYL22E1180: Okay thank you
25/05/23, 19:29 - Esnaty EWYL22E1180: I faced network challenges
29/05/23, 17:55 - Esnaty EWYL22E1180: I am a proud edoofian
29/05/23, 17:55 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
