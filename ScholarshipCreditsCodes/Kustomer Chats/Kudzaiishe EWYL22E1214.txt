16/05/23, 17:43 - Ananya: To help you make the most of all the projects available, I have devised a target table that has proven to be successful for many of my students. By following this target, you can contribute your time in a smart way and earn many credits along the way.
16/05/23, 17:44 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Alright alright

16/05/23, 17:59 - Ananya: Before that, may I ask I you have some plans or actions for project one?
16/05/23, 18:01 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Yes indeed, i already have a LinkedIn account and I'm to contact some of the corporates

16/05/23, 18:04 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Yes I'm yet to contact the current form 6s in their different schools, its just that most of the schools do not allow students to go with cellphones to school, but however we shall make contact

19/05/23, 18:34 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: I'm to answer this question or the wisdom Wednesday
19/05/23, 18:43 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: The Wednesday Wisdom document talked about leadership, servant leadership in particular. That is said to be leading in a way less adored by many, that is leadership serving others. This form of leadership as i understand it is a step to personal growth, as it requires maturity and understanding to be able to put yourself on the line.

Servant leadership comprises of self determining characteristics such as listening, empathy, stewardship, community building and persuasion just to mention a few. These characteristics are what contribute to a servant leader
19/05/23, 23:10 - Ananya: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the Wednesday lesson. It is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.
20/05/23, 01:25 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Yes yes sure, indeed ma'am

23/05/23, 15:20 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Community building is basically an effort packed activity. With regards to the three listed projects, project two, community building strikes a particular call for my attention.

As i prioritize community building, i realised that it takes various forms and styles of approach to whomever you introduce Edoofa to. At one point you are an acquaintance with good news, one point you become a friend who helps with decisions, at one point you are an advisor who gives guidance and sometimes a mentor who provides help, but ultimately you are a leader growing a community.

Working with peers particularly calls for servant leadership. It is not easy to direct and guide peers but if you step on the correct humble stones and submissively help your peers, slowly they begin to see you as a leader.

Project two is a task thag requires  feedback and advice and as a carrier of this project my main agenda to my peers is help and advise them need be. One good thing about leadership is that you do not need a title to lead but rather with much courage you can lead.

As a way to tackle project 2 however, i will become a leader of various forms. An advisor if need be, friend when needed, information provider and above all the link between the organisation and the general public.

However as we all know, desired outcomes may be far from reality, in that case that touches me as  a leader to face facts and move on. As a leader i should not give up. Even if some of my peers refuse i will keep on trying

24/05/23, 15:55 - Ananya: Great, are you ready for your session?
24/05/23, 15:56 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Yes ma'am
24/05/23, 16:01 - Ananya: May I ask if you were able to create the group?
24/05/23, 16:02 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Yes indeed, the WhatsApp group right
24/05/23, 16:05 - Ananya: Yes, did you search for the student communities on facebook?
24/05/23, 16:07 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Hadn't yet 
We were having trouble with our internet connection this side
24/05/23, 16:08 - Ananya: Alright, may I now by when would you be able to do that?
24/05/23, 16:09 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Today i will update you,
24/05/23, 16:10 - Ananya: Alright, so today we're going to talk about how to find student-centric SMEs in Africa using Google and LinkedIn. Are you familiar with these tools?
24/05/23, 16:12 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Yes
24/05/23, 16:12 - Ananya: Great,Let's start with Google. When you're searching for student-centric SMEs in Africa, what keywords do you think
24/05/23, 16:16 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Students
Small to Medium 
Africa
Education
24/05/23, 16:16 - Ananya: That's a good start. You could also try "student-centered SMEs in Africa" or "African startups focused on education". Once you have a list of relevant startups, the next step is to find the company officials on LinkedIn. Have you used LinkedIn before?
24/05/23, 16:17 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Yes i have
24/05/23, 16:18 - Ananya: Wonderful, Then, you can search for the company you're interested in by typing the name of the company into the search bar.
24/05/23, 16:19 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Yes yes indeed
24/05/23, 16:20 - Ananya: Now, before finalizing the company, you need to consider the following point:

1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.​
24/05/23, 16:22 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Alright alright
24/05/23, 16:26 - Ananya: Now, I want you to go and search for some companies on google and submit the list here.
24/05/23, 16:26 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Alt tag
24/05/23, 16:26 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Alright
24/05/23, 16:28 - Ananya: Do not forget to consider those points while choosing a company!
24/05/23, 16:28 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Of course ma'am
24/05/23, 16:41 - Ananya: Were you able to search for the companies?
24/05/23, 16:44 - Kudzaiishe EWYL22E1214: Yes I'm still taking down the details
24/05/23, 16:46 - Ananya: Alright.
24/05/23, 16:51 - Ananya: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian!
Hope are doing well.

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.
