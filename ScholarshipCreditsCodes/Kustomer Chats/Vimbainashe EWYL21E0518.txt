14/11/22, 18:05 - Vimbainashe EWYL21E0518: I am a proud Edoofian
14/11/22, 18:07 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

15/07/22, 22:22 - Vimbainashe EWYL21E0518: Patrice Motsepe had great qualities of a successful person. He had a eye for opportunity and was not afraid of taking risks. He bought a mine which others had rendered almost useless and turned it around I believe he took a risk knowing he would give the opportunity his entire strength. He was hardworking from the start, helping his father in his business and not knowing that would lead him to one day being a billionaire. He would go where he saw opportunities merging with many different successful companies and he didn't let the fact that he was different stop him. He stood among people of different race and made a mark. I believe he is one example of greatness and has inspired me to never give up and to work hard grabbing each opportunity that comes my way.

Proud Edoofians, These are the footsteps that we have to follow. The traits that he gained and possessed are not something that could be taught in schools\/ universities. That is why our head coach, Ms. Davi, tries that through every lesson you are able to get one step closer towards gaining these traits and making your career sucessful.
15/07/22, 22:37 - Vimbainashe EWYL21E0518: That is very true
15/07/22, 22:37 - Vimbainashe EWYL21E0518: I really loved the life story
15/07/22, 22:39 - Unknown: Vimbainashe, Are you experiencing power cuts now also?
15/07/22, 22:51 - Vimbainashe EWYL21E0518: Yes Sir... I'm using a very small solar to charge my phone but sometimes its too cloudy to charge the phone
15/07/22, 22:55 - Unknown: Vimbainashe, So for how much time is your phone active in a day?
15/07/22, 22:56 - Vimbainashe EWYL21E0518: Very little about an hour at most... Right now it's on 20%
15/07/22, 23:09 - Unknown: So, Vimbainashe, Is it possible for us to connect for a 5 mins in that 1 hour window?
15/07/22, 23:10 - Vimbainashe EWYL21E0518: Yes I think it is
15/07/22, 23:10 - Vimbainashe EWYL21E0518: The problem may be that the network may not be strong but I think we can make it work
16/07/22, 18:02 - Unknown: Good Morning, Proud Edoofian ?
I hope that you are in good health and spirits

We will be continuing with where we left in our scheduled session next week.
I wanted to inform you that I won't be active on the EWYL DEDICATED LINE this weekend. I have dedicated this weekend to the Edoofians who are in India. I will be getting on calls with them and checking how everything is going.

I would want you to follow the points given below:
◼️Make sure that you follow the Proud Edoofian ritual (Even on Sunday?)
◼️Keep an eye on the Saturday Activity that will be shared in your batch group
◼️Also, If you haven't submitted the Wednesday Lesson yet, Please make sure that you submit it as soon as possible.
◼️I would like to you work diligently on the EWYL Projects and submit your Project Progress Form in our next scheduled session.

I wish you a blessed and a joyful weekend ahead✨

19/07/22, 00:46 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

19/07/22, 23:15 - Vimbainashe EWYL21E0518: Zimbabwe as a developing country has many sectors that are fast growing and bringing in lots of profits for the ones operating those sectors. The Agricultural sector is one of these. With many rich business people putting most of their finances in Agriculture and getting a lot more back it is safe to say that Agriculture is fast growing and bringing in lots of money. Zimbabwe has great soil for Farming and vast pieces of fertile land to exploit. Africa in general is mainly based in agriculture and this sector is one sector if one invests in is bound to get something back.

25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
