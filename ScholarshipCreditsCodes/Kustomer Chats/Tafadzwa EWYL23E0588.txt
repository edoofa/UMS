Here's the flow for our upcoming session:

Saturday Activity Response: Please make sure to have your response to the Saturday activity ready. This will be the first thing we discuss.

Project Updates: I'd like you to provide updates on two fronts:

Community Building Project: How many referrals have you received so far, and what progress have you made?

African School Reforms Project: Similarly, please update me on the number of referrals and the status of your work in this project.

Challenges and Roadblocks: We'll then delve into the challenges you're encountering while working on these projects. Be prepared to discuss any obstacles you've faced and any assistance you might need to overcome them.

19/09/23, 01:03 - Unknown: Remember, the goal of our session is to make sure you're on track, address any issues, and keep making progress.
Looking forward to a productive session on Tuesday!

19/09/23, 15:39 - Unknown: Hello Tafadzwa, I hope you're doing well today. It's always a pleasure to connect with you for our sessions. üåü
19/09/23, 15:55 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0588: I'm doing well thanks for asking and for the acknowledgement
19/09/23, 16:00 - Unknown: Fantastic! Let's make this session a productive one. To begin, I'd like to hear about your Saturday activity. Could you please share your responses for the same ?
19/09/23, 16:07 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0588: 1. How to fight peer pressure from my fellow school colleagues?
2. I will use their help by being determined and focused, by prizing team work and collaboration so that I work hand in hand with my mentors to aim for the highest grades.
19/09/23, 16:10 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0588: By the help of my mentors I will also be a testimony of the statement which says *Every challenge is an opportunity in disguise and one's potential knows no bound* therefore by the help of my mentors no matter how many times I fall down I will always rise, dust myself and move forward.
19/09/23, 16:13 - Unknown: This is indeed a great understanding and a very logical answer to the question.
You have brought a positive approach to deal with things which is commendable.
19/09/23, 16:13 - Unknown: Now, let's shift attention to the three projects we've been discussing, particularly the

Community Building and African School Reforms initiatives.

19/09/23, 16:18 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0588: On project 2, im still working on it and seems like they're still considering it
On project 3, I've managed to come up with some few email addresses of the secondary schools but I haven't managed to reach out to them as of yet because yesterday my network connectivity was a bit down
19/09/23, 16:37 - Unknown: Hey there, Tafadzwa! I totally get what you mean. Sometimes, when we have things to do, we might spend a lot of time thinking about them or planning them out. But what I want to tell you is that it's also important to start doing those tasks, like homework or projects, without waiting too long.

You see, when we take action and start working on what needs to be done, we can actually get more things accomplished. It's like when you're playing a game, and the longer you wait to start, the less time you have to win. But when you jump into the game early, you have a better chance of winning, right?

So, don't wait too long to start your tasks. Begin working on them as soon as you can, and you'll find that you can achieve even better results. It's all about taking action and making progress!
19/09/23, 16:37 - Unknown: How many community-building forms have you successfully completed, and what is the typical number of students you have engaged with on average?
19/09/23, 16:39 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0588: Noted with thanks ma'am.
19/09/23, 16:40 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0588: As I approached them yesterday,  they said they wanted some time to think of it
I'm sure before the end of the day I will have something at hand
19/09/23, 16:56 - Unknown: Okay this is good.
19/09/23, 16:56 - Unknown: Now I want to set a target and I will also send a plan to achieve that target.
This is regarding the community building project so are you ready for that?
19/09/23, 16:57 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0588: Yes ma'am
19/09/23, 17:06 - Unknown: Goal/Target : Connect with at least 40 students before our next session  and you should be able to submit at least  15 filled Edoofa forms.
19/09/23, 17:08 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0588: Alright ma'am.
19/09/23, 17:14 - Unknown: Plan:

1. Target Identification: Identify specific groups of students who may benefit from Edoofa, such as those interested in higher education abroad or scholarships.

2. Elevator Pitch: Prepare a concise and persuasive pitch about Edoofa, highlighting its benefits, scholarship opportunities, and how it can help them achieve their educational goals.

3. Use Online Platforms: Leverage social media, student forums, and educational groups to connect with potential students. Share Edoofa's mission and the link to the forms.
19/09/23, 17:15 - Unknown: 4. Personal Outreach: Encourage one-on-one conversations with classmates, friends, and acquaintances, explaining how Edoofa can assist them in their educational journey.

5. Time Management: Allocate specific hours each day or week for outreach and follow-ups. Create a schedule to ensure consistent efforts.

6. Follow-Up: Maintain a record of contacted students and regularly follow up with reminders, additional information, or answers to questions.
19/09/23, 17:15 - Unknown: 7. Progress Tracking: Keep a log of interactions, the number of forms distributed, and the number of filled forms received to track progress toward the goal.
19/09/23, 17:15 - Unknown: Tafadzwa what do you think about the plan and target?
19/09/23, 17:16 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0588: I'm very impressed 
Thank you so much ma'am,  what would I have done without you
19/09/23, 17:16 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0588: This is a topnotch well articulated and organised
20/09/23, 08:49 - Unknown: Good Morning Tafadzwa
I hope you are doing well

Thank you for your kind words. I see immense potential in you to perform well in these projects. A lot of my other students have been able to earn around $900- $1000 already.
And I am also convinced that you can perform even better.
All you need to do is stay consistent with your efforts and try as many times as you.
And in no less time you will be perfect in this field.
And I am always there to help you whenever you face any difficulty.
We will be doing it together.

22/09/23, 16:05 - Unknown: In such a case they cannot fill the form again.
22/09/23, 16:05 - Unknown: Let's revisit the objective. 
In the Community Building Project, our aim is to contact 40 other students and collect at least 20 filled forms. This project is about fostering a sense of community and involvement among our peers and most importantly learning the skills to speak with confidence and conviction infront of people
22/09/23, 16:06 - Unknown: Now that you have got few of the forms -
22/09/23, 16:06 - Unknown: Please  make sure the students are completely aware of what Edoofa is and what it does and even the admission stages.

If the student goes to the admission counselor and denies that his/her friend did not discuss anything about Edoofa then you will not earn any scholarship credits.
22/09/23, 16:06 - Unknown: Please read these details very carefully.
22/09/23, 16:06 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0588: ü•∫seems like all of the Heads I'm reaching out to are Edoofa Agents already

22/09/23, 16:07 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0588: Thank you
22/09/23, 16:07 - Unknown: Ohh I see the problem. Please do not worry about that. Try reaching out to schools of an area which is a bit far away from your place
22/09/23, 16:08 - Unknown: Coming to our discussion earlier, To be on a safer side. Connect with the students on WhatsApp personally. Once they fill the form. Then give them resources and information about Edoofa.
22/09/23, 16:08 - Unknown: Train them about the process so they are informed completely when the admission counsellors will contact them and also, we will have a proof that yes you have explained it all.
22/09/23, 16:15 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0588: Thank you ma'am
22/09/23, 16:16 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0588: I'm following,  thank you ma'am
22/09/23, 16:19 - Unknown: Along with that make sure you are giving them an explanation about your journey, about the benefits that you have got and about the skills that you will be acquiring in the process.
22/09/23, 16:20 - Unknown: Make it clear to students that Edoofa is not a sponsorship platform. Rather, you will get a scholarship on the basis of various factors which include your grades in previous classes, the way you perform in your interviews, your statement of purpose, your letter of recommendation and many more.Along with it Make it clear to students that Edoofa is not a sponsorship platform.

22/09/23, 16:20 - Unknown: Also, you can compare the cost of studying in your own country with the cost of studying in India through Edoofa. And guess what? It's usually cheaper to study in India with Edoofa!
22/09/23, 16:27 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0588: Wow, thank you ma'am
22/09/23, 16:28 - Unknown: Now, I'd like to hear about your progress. How many students have you successfully contacted so far, and how many forms have been filled? Remember, each interaction counts, even if it didn't lead to a form filled. Share your achievements with me
22/09/23, 16:37 - Tafadzwa EWYL23E0588: I've reached over 30 students so far, and I've have successfully managed to chat with just a half of them as they are taking their time to consider and to respond to this 
Students are very amazed with such initiative even though some are thinking that this sounds too good to be true I'm trying by all means to explain to them that EDOOFA, is real, legit and very genuine
22/09/23, 16:42 - Unknown: This is really great Tafadzwa
For this you can speak to them about your journey and show them documents that I have shared with you on your EWYL group right now.
