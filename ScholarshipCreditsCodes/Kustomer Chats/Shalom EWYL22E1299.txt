16/03/23, 04:54 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian,
This week's Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the topic of \"Seeking Wealth, not Money or Status.\" This is an important lesson that will provide valuable insights into the pursuit of financial stability and success. During this lesson, we will explore the concept of wealth and its importance in building a sustainable financial future. We will discuss the difference between wealth, money, and status, and how each of these concepts plays a role in our lives.
I encourage you to read the lesson in detail and take notes to fully understand the material. It is important to engage with this topic and think critically about your own financial goals and aspirations.
By understanding the importance of seeking wealth over money or status, you can develop a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial success. I look forward to exploring this topic with you in more detail during our upcoming lesson.

Happy learning!","transform":"

How are you?
Please share your understanding of the Wednesday lesson so that we can soon discuss the PROJECTS.
17/03/23, 23:05 - Shalom EWYL22E1299: I understood that people think seeking wealth ,money and status will bring them happiness and fulfilment not knowing that these things normally lead to stress, anxiety and even depression.wealth is defined as having asserts that earn while you sleep.this means the value of our asserts continues to grow even when we are not actively working or earning money wealth are things like Stoke ,bonds and buildings (real states)when u invest in those things you can earn dividends while you sleep .the value of property can appreciate over time .money is simply a tool that we use to transfer time and wealth.money is important but it should not be the sole focus of your financial persuits .seeking wealth ,not money or status is a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial stability and success
17/03/23, 23:27 - Saloni Rastogi: You have concluded the understanding of the lesson so well. Even my learning has been that 'Money is simply a tool that we use to transfer time and wealth, and that status is not a measure of true success or happiness. Instead, focus on building wealth and creating a life that brings you joy and fulfillment.' 
And you know _earning scholarship credits_ is just parallel to creating that joy and fulfillment and aiming higher by seeing how much you have earned and beating all the records.

18/03/23, 20:43 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings *my proud edoofian*!

Here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!

20/03/23, 19:59 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

21/03/23, 22:29 - Saloni Rastogi: You know I am deeply inspired by the missions that you have shared with me.
I was stuck at the point where you mentioned that you want to buy shared, it clearly shows that you learn a lot from these lessons.
Along with this, in every response, I like to enlighten my students on how I feel about the lesson\/activity and how smoothly it connects with them.
For this one also, I would firstly say that my biggest mission is to provide a happy life for my mother who has done so much for me in the past so many years.
And the second goal, that I believe is driving me every day to work hard is the curiosity to meet my students at the airport and see them earning at least $100 of scholarship credits every month so that they become so independent that can pay their own fees.
21/03/23, 22:29 - Saloni Rastogi: I am so happy to see that you have created the LinkediN accounts.
21/03/23, 22:30 - Saloni Rastogi: Now, it's time that we know which kind of companies to target.

29/03/23, 01:12 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for the delayed response, I was occupied in an internal meeting with the team with was to be attended as a priority about our visit starting tomorrow till Saturday.
As informed, no sessions will be held during this time and we will begin afresh from next week onwards where I will be sharing some crazy and interesting insights with you.
But this will only be done, we you will NOT MISS these *THREE THINGS*:
1) Timely submission of the Wednesday lesson and weekend activity
2) Daily following the ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', the absence of which can lead to not sharing of weekly lessons and activities with you
3) and most importantly, *PROGRESS ON PROJECTS*

I will be tracking the progress on _Monday_.
I completely know that these two weeks, we might not have dedicated discussions on the projects. So in my absence, I want that you think in-depth about *the project you are doing, revising the targets for the same, and completing it*.
I would really be emotional and happy that in a few months, many of the new edoofians will be joining our Indian family here. And honestly, I will be happier that we start preparing now for the future because growth is not measured in one day. We need to work hard consistently and dedicatedly.

Like I always say ‘1 step daily means 1 step UP. 0 step daily means 1 step DOWN’.
I trust you, just believe in yourself.

30/03/23, 20:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Dear Students,
I hope this message finds you well. As your EWYL progresses, it is important that you stay up to date with your assignments and coursework. In order to ensure that you are able to move forward with the new lessons, I want to remind you that you must complete all of your previous assignments by the end of this week.

It is essential that you take the time to thoroughly review and complete your previous assignments. Doing so will not only help you to understand the lesson better, but it will also prepare you for the upcoming lessons. Failure to complete the previous assignments may result in a delay of the new lessons, and ultimately, it may impact your EWYL progress.

Therefore, I urge you to make the completion of your previous assignments a priority. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to seeing your completed assignments and to sharing the new lessons with you soon.

Best regards,
Team EWYL","transform":"
