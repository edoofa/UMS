13/07/22, 16:19 - Kudzaishe EWYL21E0739: Good morning Ms. Riva. May l please have the Weekend activity and today's activity altogether?
13/07/22, 16:20 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

13/07/22, 19:12 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
Let us start our day with a quote  is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence*
14/07/22, 00:08 - Kudzaishe EWYL21E0739: Thank you
14/07/22, 00:45 - Unknown: It's time for Wednesday Wisdom, and this week we're going to learn how the son of a former teacher in an African school made over $1 billion dollars. You did read it correctly.
When I read the lesson, I personally learned a lot. In the lecture, some of the top success secrets are revealed.

Be sure to thoroughly read the PDF document, and if you choose, you can note down things that you liked or were inspired by and we can discuss them in our session on *Thursday- 10 AM*

Happy studying!
14/07/22, 01:20 - Kudzaishe EWYL21E0739: Thank you

14/07/22, 18:08 - Kudzaishe EWYL21E0739: Good morning Ms. Riva
14/07/22, 18:12 - Kudzaishe EWYL21E0739: Patrice started out small and grew his way up. This is totally a challenge because some of us hope to be successful in a day. Patrice kept on working hard and learning new stuff across the years which resulted in his success later on. We need to push ourselves every day because we have the potential just like Patrice did.
14/07/22, 18:42 - Unknown: I am glad that the text inspired you but can you elaborate a bit where he said you do not always need a teacher to learn?
14/07/22, 22:04 - Kudzaishe EWYL21E0739: That js totally right. Sometimes if you want to move forward with your life and make changes to circumstances, you have to do it yourself. You do not need a lecture or a tutorial to get things done but you have to take that step and be willing to learn and figure out things by yourself as you go.
14/07/22, 22:13 - Unknown: Right but again do you realise the opportunity here. You have a mentor available for you to do things for you , to tell you about stuff but you have to gauge it.
14/07/22, 22:14 - Unknown: Now Kudzaishe your session is tomorrow. Make a note it is Tuesday and Friday not Tuesday and Thursday.
15/07/22, 03:10 - Kudzaishe EWYL21E0739: Yes, thank you

​Let start our day with this beautiful quote  you believe it’ll work out, you’ll see opportunities. If you don’t believe it’ll work out, you’ll see obstacles.” – Wayne Dyer*
15/07/22, 18:52 - Unknown: Yes Kudzaishe it does
15/07/22, 19:37 - Kudzaishe EWYL21E0739: Inspirational. Thank you.
15/07/22, 19:37 - Kudzaishe EWYL21E0739: Ok that is good.
15/07/22, 22:44 - Unknown: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e, you will be having 2 sessions on selected days. On Wednesday I will be
sharing the lesson of the week or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.

Are we connected?
24/07/22, 15:16 - Kudzaishe EWYL21E0739: No progress, Ms. Riva. I am sorry. May l ask that are the three projects the only ones we should have to do until we complete the whole course?

Because I thought the community building project is more easy to do, l have been putting my attention to it only.

25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

27/07/22, 17:24 - Unknown: Actions that are based on the principles of Oneness are rewarding in the sense that they fill us with happiness and joy, whether or not you get your desired results. Just the act of committing to the effort makes us feel connected to everything and can help heal isolation, loneliness, and helplessness.
Hence in edoofa you can show your commitment and efforts by working on the projects we have, also *as a mentor I understand that projects have a dependency on others for example if some school head is responding or not, whether a company is interested or not etc but for activities and lessons you should keep the focus on top to shine in the community*

I realised as soon as I started reading this lesson that most of my students needed to learn and grasp this. One person succeeding and one failing depends solely on how effectively they manage their time. Try to comprehend and apply the measures discussed in the lesson to your everyday life. I'll be here to help you, so that you can focus on learning how to manage your time effectively. In our following session, please explain in detail what you learned from the lesson.Also, do not forget to send *it by 12PM today.*

Happy learning
28/07/22, 19:13 - Unknown: Hello Kudzaishe,
I am glad that you have safely arrived in India.

Hope you had a great journey!

I am hoping to connect with you soon.
I wanted to ask you have you completed your *reporting process*?
*Today 5 pm is the deadline for the same.*

Please make sure you get it done today!
28/07/22, 20:09 - Kudzaishe EWYL21E0739: Thank you
28/07/22, 20:11 - Kudzaishe EWYL21E0739: I have not yet. I thought you would have asked if l settled in yet but l guess not. l think hopefully tomorrow l would have settled in with my luggage at a place and start worrying about reporting processes.
28/07/22, 20:21 - Unknown: Okay so Kudzaishe, this text was meant to be for that only.

Also, in case of any concerns you can directly reach out to me and I will communicate with LPU.
I wanted to make sure that you complete the reporting process as it is going to end  by 5 pm, for your benefit so that you do not have to run behind later.

I am concerned about you, probably I will be seeing you as well in a few days.
