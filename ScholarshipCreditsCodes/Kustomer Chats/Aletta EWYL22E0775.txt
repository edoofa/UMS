06/01/23, 22:41 - Unknown: Hello My proud Edoofian, 

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

Let us have a longer discussion about your learnings in our upcoming session. 

Happy learning.

17/01/23, 01:17 - Unknown: The task is to look for potential companies that can collaborate with EDOOFA and are willing to extend their help in the overall development of all the students that enroll in the Edoofa program. The factors which you should consider for the right company are
1. Nature of the company- it should be either student-centric or it could be recreational or it could be content-centric platform
2. The scale of the company- the scale of the company should not be either too big or small .l should also look at the employee size of the company (50-200)
3. Financial stability  must be financially sound 
4. Background of founders-companies with a founder having a strong background (in terms of experience and qualifications)

There are steps which you should take, which are 
1. Searching 
2. Studying a little more about the company and its functioning for that purpose 
3. Studying the website of the company
4. Check the various social media pages of the company
5. Understand and study the background of the founder and other core members 
6 . Reach out to them by dropping an invitation note and sending a connection request
17/01/23, 01:23 - Aletta EWYL22E0775: So how do I present the information to you
17/01/23, 01:34 - Unknown: Well you will research the salient features of the company first and share with me the required details in the form I have shared with you.
