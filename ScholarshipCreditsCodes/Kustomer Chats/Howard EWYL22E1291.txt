29/03/23, 00:57 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Howard
Hope you are doing well.
29/03/23, 00:57 - Aditi Kapoor: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
29/03/23, 00:58 - Aditi Kapoor: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
29/03/23, 00:58 - Aditi Kapoor: There is an important announcement for you. 
I will be away for the remainder of the week as I will be visiting our students who are currently studying at Indian Universities.
In order to assess your commitment and enthusiasm toward pursuing a scholarship opportunity in India, I would like to assign you a task. You are free to choose any project or projects of your liking and are requested to complete and submit 10 forms by the end of this week.
I believe this task will provide us with valuable insights into your dedication to your academic pursuits and your desire to earn scholarship credits for future education in India.
All the best and have a great day ahead.
29/03/23, 00:59 - Aditi Kapoor: Once I am back from the visit. We will be discuss about your days and time of the session.
29/03/23, 00:59 - Aditi Kapoor: The correct answer is A. Zambezi

Do you know? 

The Zambezi River is the fourth-longest river in Africa, the longest east-flowing river in Africa and the largest flowing into the Indian Ocean from Africa.","transform":"

01/04/23, 00:42 - Aditi Kapoor: Dear Students,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and let you know that I was overwhelmed by the response from students during my recent university visit. While I was thrilled to see so many of my students, I am currently working on performance evaluation of each one of them. Hence I would like to inform you that I will not be able to attend to your queries during the weekend that is tomorrow and day after. 

However, I would like to assure you that I will be available to connect with you in our upcoming session on Monday\/Tuesday. Please make sure you mark your calendars and plan to attend that session so we can address any questions or concerns you may have and proceed with our discussions then.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. I am looking forward to our next session and I hope to see you all there.

Till then take care and don’t forget to work on your pending activities from this month.","transform":"
