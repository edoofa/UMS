24/03/23, 18:52 - Unknown: Hello Charles, welcome back to the EWYL Line.
24/03/23, 18:54 - Unknown: As you know there are hundreds of students that I talk to every day and you have texted me from a new number. So may I know your EWYL Name and your full name again?
24/03/23, 18:57 - Unknown: Let me share the Wednesday Lesson for you
24/03/23, 18:57 - Unknown: I want to ask you a question: Have you Despised Wealth?

The concept of wealth has been a topic of much debate and discussion for centuries. While some view wealth as a means to achieve success and fulfillment, others may view it with suspicion or even disdain. However, it is important to understand that ethical wealth creation is possible and can be a force for good in the world. In this regard, it is essential to examine our own perspectives on wealth creation, and consider how they may impact our relationship with money, status, and success.

Read today’s lesson in detail and let's have a detailed discussion in our upcoming session. I am sure today’s lesson will lead to many fruitful discussions and will assist you in planning better for your journey towards wealth creation.

25/03/23, 23:56 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

I am pleased to observe that a majority of you comprehended well, the message  that was conveyed in this week's Wednesday wisdom. It brought me great joy to go through student’s perspectives on wealth creation and the mindset essential for embarking on this path.

I have a special Saturday assignment for you. The objective of this assignment is to help you understand the steps you can take to prepare yourself for wealth creation. The assignment will encourage you to identify their goals, develop a financial plan, and cultivate the mindset and habits needed to achieve financial success.

Here are some instructions to make it easy for you to work on this assignment:
1. Goal Setting: The first step towards wealth creation is to set clear and achievable goals. In this section, write down your short-term and long-term financial goals. Explain how each goal will contribute to your overall financial success.
2. Financial Planning: A financial plan is a roadmap that outlines how you will achieve your financial goals. In this section, develop a comprehensive financial plan that includes strategies for budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management. Identify the resources you will need to achieve your financial plan and explain how you will access them.
3. Mindset and Habits: Wealth creation is not just about having a financial plan; it is also about cultivating the mindset and habits that will help you achieve your goals. In this section, identify the mindset and habits that are necessary for financial success. Explain how you will cultivate these qualities in yourself and develop strategies to overcome any obstacles that may arise.
4. Conclusion: In this section, summarize your findings and discuss the importance of preparing yourself for wealth creation. Reflect on what you have learned throughout the assignment and discuss how you will apply these principles in your own life.

During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I hope this message finds you well. 
Last week, I had the opportunity to visit some of our partner universities, and I am excited to share with you how fruitful it was to meet the students there.

During my visits, I had the pleasure of meeting with students from different countries and cultures. We discussed various topics ranging from academic opportunities, EWYL Projects, and future career prospects. It was a great opportunity to exchange ideas and experiences, and I was impressed by the level of enthusiasm and curiosity among the students.
04/04/23, 18:07 - Unknown: I also had the chance to tour the campuses and learn more about the facilities and resources available for students. I was pleased to see that our partner universities are committed to providing high-quality education and support services to their students.

\"Consistency is the foundation of achievement. Stay consistent in your actions, and you will achieve your goals.\"

As discussed in Wednesday's lesson, consistency is key to achieving your goals. In order to assess your understanding of this topic, I request that you submit a brief write-up on what you learned from the lesson and your discussions with your mentors, and how you plan to apply it to your daily routine. Please submit your responses before your next Scheduled Session.

Also, I want you to write a heartfelt message to your mentors, discussing the obstacles you are encountering that are preventing you from maintaining consistency in your sessions and EWYL submissions.

Remember, consistency is not just about doing something once, but about making a habit. So, let's work together to build consistent study habits and achieve success!

Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Here we are with our weekend activity, it has been some time that we are talking about leadership, styles of leadership and have even learnt alot for our leader from Edoofa. It goes without saying that leadership is a skill that one acquires over time and with continous effort to acquire this characteristic.The EWYL programme, each project and task that is assigned to you, is a direct place for you to practise this skill. This weekend, sit with yourself and write about how you can use the EWYL programme to master the skill of leadership, and make a plan for which projects you will prioritise to be a leader in the student community. How will you ensure that your name is on the next list of student leaders for the Edoofa student community? Some of the students have already been recommended as Student Leaders by the mentors; how will you ensure that your name is on the next list of student leaders for the Edoofa student community?

Since a detailed plan is required, so the minimum word limit of today’s activity is 150 words.
The last day to submit your responses is Monday and don’t forget only the responses shared on dedicated EWYL line will be evaluated.

06/06/23, 00:30 - Unknown:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, Let me share a small story with you!
 Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came. 
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.
The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell: 

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. 
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above

30/06/23, 16:12 - Unknown: In these 21 days, I want that we engage in the best possible manner to bring out fruitful results.

So this time you have to be *REGULAR IN YOUR SESSIONS*


Before we begin, let's go over what a complete session involves. 📚

▪️ First of all, you have to *come to the EWYL LINE every single day and tell me HOW PROUD ARE YOU being an Edoofian* (Including Sundays and even on days you don't have your session). This means _following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' without fail on the EWYL Line._

▪️ Secondly, It's essential to *arrive on time for the session*, as being late will not be considered as attending a session. _This brings the importance of being punctual for the session._

▪️ During our sessions, we'll cover two key topics: the *Wednesday Lesson or Weekend Activity* and *Project Updates*
30/06/23, 16:13 - Charles EWYL22E0484: Oky that can be done
30/06/23, 16:22 - Unknown: To ensure your progress, I will ask for your Lessons or Activities submissions during the session. It's essential to be prepared and ready to share your work when prompted.🎓
30/06/23, 16:23 - Charles EWYL22E0484: Yes I understand
30/06/23, 16:35 - Unknown: Now in order to grasp this incredible opportunity, you have to complete a task! Are you ready for it?
30/06/23, 16:49 - Charles EWYL22E0484: Yes I'm prepared
30/06/23, 16:50 - Unknown: Now, let's talk about a challenge that is included in the above-mentioned Project Update! ✈️
I have set a target for a week, which involves sharing:


*15 Community Building forms*
and
*1 School Connect form*


To mark a session as completed, your active presence is required throughout our session time. If you encounter any network or mobile issues, I recommend addressing them beforehand so that we can make the most of our time together.

Remember, excuses won't be accepted because I believe in your determination.
30/06/23, 16:51 - Charles EWYL22E0484: Oky ma'am will try my very best to be active
30/06/23, 16:52 - Unknown: Coming to the point that you might have also noticed and something that brings a flavor to this challenge is Extra Curricular activity


When it comes to overall assessment and evaluation, we believe it's not just about projects and lessons. It's about how passionate you are about yourself. Therefore, there is another aspect for evaluation, which is extracurricular activities.

In the next 21 days, It's your turn to show your amazing talent and be better than all the other students in this thrilling competition. Show everyone what you can do and make them amazed by your skills.

As your mentor, I want you to tell me about what else you are good at besides academics and share your idea of how you will showcase that talent to us.
30/06/23, 16:55 - Charles EWYL22E0484: So I'm into athletics(short distance running), cricket I'm a wonderful pace bowler and aslo a great batsman, I'm also into soccer, rugby and handball

30/06/23, 16:57 - Charles EWYL22E0484: Oky that may do will have to prepare on it then

01/07/23, 15:56 - Unknown: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!

22/12/22, 17:36 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
22/12/22, 17:41 - Charles EWYL22E0484: Well in my family like most of all Zimbabwean families celebrate Christmas in a similar way. Yes it's true that most of the young generation are now staying in cities and towns and thats not so different from my family. On the Christmas celebration, all of my ralatives gather in our rural place in chiweshe for this wonderful celebration. There is an addition of activities such as braai
22/12/22, 17:45 - Charles EWYL22E0484: Dance competitions and also yes dressing in their best clothes. So basically what they do is during the morning most time is spent in decorations and preparations. Around 10 am and 12 is the time where people are expected to be cleaning up and in the afternoon the fun starts its usually last up to 5 am the next day as after the partying all the relatives go out to a photo booth for a family portrait each year and after that it ends in a church ceremony to thank the Lord for yet another good year of good health
22/12/22, 18:39 - Unknown: Great work!
I can also say that I learnt something new from your Wednesday Lesson submission.
I also hope that you are all set for Christmas this year
22/12/22, 18:40 - Charles EWYL22E0484: Yes we're set. I hope the same for you too

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Make sure you are able to self-finance your higher education here in India!. For that, Let us start with a smaller target of earning between $30-$50 per month and as we increase our earnings, We will keep increasing this target as well
3. And ensure that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world, workplace and help you grow holistically which we will do by judiciously making use of the lessons and activities


Also, I wanted to inform you that we won’t be having any sessions Today.

04/01/23, 23:47 - Unknown: Since, It’s Wednesday Today, which means that it is time for our *WEDNESDAY Lesson*.
I will be sharing the lesson with you soon.

Also, feel free to share any queries that you have, We will be discussing them in our next session.
Have a cheerful day ahead!
04/01/23, 23:48 - Unknown: *Wednesday Lesson | 4 Jan*

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy learning.

05/01/23, 14:54 - Charles EWYL22E0484: Good morning

I hope that you are doing well
06/01/23, 18:12 - Unknown: Let us start with our session.
Please share your Wednesday lesson submission
I hope that you were aware that you had to submit it 5 mins before our Today's session.
06/01/23, 19:12 - Unknown: Edoofian, Punctuality in school life builds the path to success in a student's life by enabling them to plan ahead, make an efficient routine, and be prepared for their tasks. A punctual student is better equipped to deal with their day-to-day tasks than a person who leaves it for the last moment. Please note that we would only be able to earn the desired amount of credits if we are punctual at our session timings.

Before, We start with our next session, I would like you to specify the reason for your absence from Today's session by writing a letter to Ms Deepali, our Head of Department in the EWYL Group

Have a cheerful day ahead
08/01/23, 22:26 - Charles EWYL22E0484: Hello

09/01/23, 18:12 - Unknown: Greetings, Charles
I hope that you are doing well
09/01/23, 18:13 - Unknown: I understand, Charles
If you have an urgent commitment or task or if something like network or electricity challenge comes up, please notify me well ahead of time or before the session or even after the session that you will be unable to attend and explain the reasons for it. This clearly demonstrates your seriousness. We have students who texted to say they had power failures and would be unable to attend class at the usual time, which is understandable. However, as soon as their power was restored, they notified me and asked what they had missed due to their absence. Isn't this exactly what a sincere student would do?
13/01/23, 00:53 - Charles EWYL22E0484: Hello how are you doing I'm sorry for the absence had lost my cell phone due to the floods that where happening here I got caught up in one but I am available now very sorry for the lack of communication
13/01/23, 01:28 - Unknown: Charles, I hope everything is fine?

How are you?

13/01/23, 18:19 - Charles EWYL22E0484: I am a proud edoofian
