I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to let you know that today's Wednesday lesson is going to be a special one. We'll be delving into a captivating story that revolves around the themes of skill, hard work, and determination.

The moral of this story is a powerful one, and it's a lesson that we can carry with us throughout our lives: "Sometimes the truest treasures lay not in the allure of gold but in the craftsmanship and effort one invests in their work." This story will remind us of the value of dedication and the importance of striving for excellence in everything we do.

So, come prepared to listen, learn, and be inspired by this tale of determination and the rewards it can bring. We'll discuss the story, its characters, and the valuable lesson it imparts.

See you in our upcoming session, and let's explore the world of skill, hard work, and the true treasures that lie within our reach.

Best regards,

23/10/23, 00:22 - Abide EWYL23E0712: It is an undisputed fact that in this world we will be always struggling! In this struggle only the fittest will survive. All those who prove to be weak will unquestionably die!
A boy named Tino Mugwe was raised up from a poor class family. The ten family members lived in another rural area far away from the town. Life that end wasn't easy. They relied on manual labor as a source of income. Farming, hunting, carpentry, building and fencing are the activities they excercised to get money and earn a living. These activities are quite tiring and frustrating. Tino never liked this type of living!
His parents could only afford to pay fees on poor institutions. After being enrolled at another school in rural areas Tino did remarkably well at O level. It was unexpected and unbelievable! Nobody in their family managed to finish O level stage. His brothers and sisters never took education seriously. It was a great achievement for the him and the family. His hard work and determination made him score all As on O level. 
This boy we are talking about is an ardent believer in determination, hard work and excellence. He is always setting up tasks for himself and striving hard to archive them. This friend of mine is adamant for great success in life. Every move he makes is in line with his goals and surely comes u with victory in the end. He has no time to waste. Every breathing second is so crucial to him that he utilities it to develop self and shape his future. All he wants is to change his situation at home.
Tino didn't end there, he later decided to come in town and pursue his A level at another cheap institution. He lived alone managing his own expenses. Often at times he was expelled from school due to school fees shortages. He had one meal a day and sometimes he could not eat anything due to lack of food. When he came to school he looked tired and weary. Sometimes he came with dirty clothes. People could tease him and laugh at him. Tino didn't let all this problems and tragedies interrupt his education. Rather he made it a chance to get more determined and shape his future for the desired outcome. With all these misfortunes on his side, he made up his mind and decided that he was to do something and change his life.
When Tino was at school he befriend himself to those students who were in our upper grade. He would ask advanced information on all topics and advice on important staff from them. On his free time he visited all his teachers seeking information. All his life was now dedicated to reading and studying. He experienced a lot of sleepless nights and late night studies. The cunning boy was so hungry for success that he decided to pursue Five subjects. Due to financial hardships he couldn't register all of them but only took four of them.
Life was very fair to the genius. Fortune favors the brave! The academic gaint couldn't contain his happiness when he got in touch with his result slip. With all the pain he suffered, it was a sweet experience to gain incredible victory. You reap what you sow! Getting 20 As was a mystery and a mammoth task but he did it!
This is plainly evident enough to prove that hard work pays. In this struggle, determination, focus and perseverance is key that unlocks every dream of every individual. That way survival is guaranteed!Tino's dream of having a bright future and a better tomorrow is slowly coming. There is no doubt that he is getting there soon! Some months back he received a fully funded Governmental Scholarship to study abroad. This guy inspires me a lot! I'm very proud to have a hard working friend who is full of determination like Tino!
