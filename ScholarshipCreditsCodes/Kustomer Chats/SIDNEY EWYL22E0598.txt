02/01/23, 21:25 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

04/01/23, 23:43 - Unknown: *Wednesday Lesson | 4 Jan*

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy learning.

13/02/23, 20:28 - Unknown: One morning, an elderly man was walking along the beach when he noticed a young boy picking something off the sand and throwing it into the sea.

As he got closer, the man realized the child was throwing stranded starfishes that had washed up on the shore back into the breaking waves.

Approaching the boy, the man asked what he was doing.

“The starfish will die if they’re still on the shore when the sun rises,” he replied.

Perplexed, the old man said, “But that’s pointless! There are countless miles of beach and thousands of starfish. It doesn’t matter how many you return to the water, you can’t make a difference.”

Unfazed, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish, and tossed it into the sea.

“It matters to this one,” he said.","transform":"

15/02/23, 03:11 - SIDNEY EWYL22E0598: This is about a situation where l had to start a club at our school. The club was about environmental care. l was only in form 2 and l had to go talk to the senior lady at the school to let her know of my idea and if she was to approve l then had to go and present it to the headmaster for the final endorsement. I had never spoken to anyone in a higher authority and l was very scared but l gathered up enough confidence to speak to the senior lady and l had to do more research to make a killer presentation to the headmaster. My headmaster to me at that point he was very intimidating and he asked me a lot of questions but l was able to sail through.What l had not known was that l have to now go class by class telling the students about the club so that they can join. I had to persuade the students l can say this is when l acquired good communication skills. Some of them looked down upon me and l learnt to be bolder than l was the other students admired my boldness and that made me more confident.
