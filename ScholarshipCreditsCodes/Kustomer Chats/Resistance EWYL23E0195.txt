The Great Rift Valley is like Mother Nature showing off her impressive artistic skills. Just breathtaking!
19/11/23, 23:19 - Resistance EWYL23E0195: On the document below..l have understood that the edoofa ewyl program provides higher education with affordable prices
Whilst Covid affected the world including children education, edoofa was there ...it  acquired skills that were instrumental in one's inspirations in reaching career goals 
Edoofa did a lot by installing  online skills for instance networking, business development and so on..these skills are still used    today..the ewyl helps to lower the expenses after the scholarship credits
19/11/23, 23:27 - Resistance EWYL23E0195: In this document we have project one and two of the ewyl..the project one which is the corporate aliances thereby one will be identifying local organisations,identifying decision makers in the companies,,sharing with them edoofa's vision  and mission 
The organisation are found on the Internet..after everything one arranges the video call between edoofa founders with the managers  of the company
Then we have the project 2 of the ewyl which is the community building whereby one will be sharing about the edoofa to relatives, friends or cousin on social media...this is beneficiary for example if a student enrolls one gets $20 scholarship credits
20/11/23, 19:00 - Saloni Rastogi: Good afternoon Resistance,
I trust this message finds you well.

I'm genuinely excited about our upcoming sessions scheduled for Tuesday from 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM. As we gear up for tomorrow's session on the EWYL Line, I've been giving some thought to ways we can enhance our engagement and involve your parents in the process.

After careful consideration, we've decided to shift our sessions to the EWYL Group starting tomorrow. This change not only allows us to keep your parents in the loop but also it removes the dependency on your following the daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

Starting tomorrow, our sessions will be held from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, Monday to Friday, on the EWYL Group. This adjustment aims to streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this change to confirm your understanding.

I look forward to our continued collaboration!
20/11/23, 19:01 - Saloni Rastogi: I am extremely delighted to hear your understanding of the project document, I am thrilled to take forward with the journey tomorrow on the EWYL Group.
20/11/23, 20:42 - Resistance EWYL23E0195: Okay noted Mentor

21/11/23, 15:52 - Saloni Rastogi: There was an article that I went through this morning and the motivation that I received from it, made me so energetic. Here is a glimpse of it:

Get ready to unleash your potential because you're not just here to keep up; you're here to outshine. The competition? It's the spice that makes success sweeter. In this journey of learning, every test, and every assignment is a chance to outdo yourself. Imagine a world where you consistently surprise even your own expectations. It's not about beating others; it's about becoming a better version of yourself. So, let's tackle challenges with passion, bounce back from setbacks with resilience, and commit to being better than we were yesterday. The world is waiting for the unique brilliance that only you can bring. You've got this!

Your mentor
Ms. Saloni
