12/01/24, 13:11 - Ananya: Good morning, Nicole!

Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
12/01/24, 13:12 - Nicole EWYL23E1068: Morning
12/01/24, 13:13 - Nicole EWYL23E1068: This is such amazing news. I can not wait to be a part of it.
12/01/24, 13:19 - Ananya: .
12/01/24, 13:19 - Ananya: .

12/01/24, 13:27 - Ananya: So Nicole, to begin with our next journey I think we should begin with something that aligns with your interests! So, would you like to tell me which one is your favorite project?
12/01/24, 13:30 - Nicole EWYL23E1068: From the 3 projects l liked the the 3rd project which is The African School Education Reformation project. It
12/01/24, 13:48 - Ananya: That's great! So can I know the progress of the same?
12/01/24, 13:53 - Nicole EWYL23E1068: I have contacted some school headmaster's and directors, they are yet to give me feedback.
12/01/24, 13:55 - Ananya: Did you talk to them again like a follow up?
12/01/24, 13:57 - Nicole EWYL23E1068: Yes I did so today and I am waiting for their response.
12/01/24, 14:24 - Ananya: By the way, add the following points while talking to the school heads!

Along with this, schools can be benefited in the following way:
1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‚ÄòA-Level‚Äô/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(PHD.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
12/01/24, 14:55 - Nicole EWYL23E1068: Okay then, l will certainly do so.
15/01/24, 12:42 - Nicole EWYL23E1068: I am a proud Edoofian.

16/01/24, 13:03 - Ananya: Good morning, Nicole

I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:

Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! üòÑ
16/01/24, 13:05 - Nicole EWYL23E1068: üòÇüòÇüòÇ that's a good one
16/01/24, 13:27 - Ananya: For today, I have planned something special! Do you know about a resume or a CV?
16/01/24, 13:34 - Nicole EWYL23E1068: Yes l do know about it
16/01/24, 13:35 - Ananya: Wow! You know, a resume is like a super important paper for students. It shows all the cool things you've done in school and outside. When you want to get into a good school or get a job, you give them your resume so they can see how awesome you are. It's like your personal advertisement that says, 'Hey, I'm really good at these things, and I can do great stuff for you!' So, having a good resume helps you stand out and get cool opportunities.
16/01/24, 13:38 - Nicole EWYL23E1068: Yes it definitely is important
16/01/24, 13:41 - Ananya: Now, please watch this video and create a resume by our next session. As of now, let us now discuss your EWYL project. Now moving ahead I want to discuss something significant with you. You know, seeing over 400 students at the SLICE-CON has motivated me to work for my students even harder. I want you to be here in India and pay your fee all by yourself. For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed with a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?
16/01/24, 13:43 - Nicole EWYL23E1068: Thank you.
16/01/24, 13:43 - Nicole EWYL23E1068: Well yes l have a bit.
16/01/24, 13:45 - Ananya: .
16/01/24, 13:51 - Nicole EWYL23E1068: Okay thank you l have taken note of that.
16/01/24, 13:52 - Nicole EWYL23E1068: Have you reached Mcebo Mahlangu?
16/01/24, 13:55 - Ananya: Nicole, have you shred the form for Mcebo with you?
16/01/24, 13:55 - Ananya: Nicole, have you shared the form for Mcebo with you?
16/01/24, 13:57 - Nicole EWYL23E1068: Yes l have shared it
16/01/24, 14:00 - Ananya: Can I know when?
16/01/24, 14:01 - Nicole EWYL23E1068: About 3 weeks ago.
16/01/24, 14:02 - Ananya: Can you please share it with me again? As per our records, you have shared the form with Ms Pallika not me.
16/01/24, 14:07 - Nicole EWYL23E1068: Okay let me share it with you.

From the power of positive thinking and definiteness of purpose to the significance of collaboration and visualization, we will unravel the wealth of wisdom embedded in Hill's masterpiece.

Whether you're already familiar with the book or discovering it for the first time, this lesson promises to provide valuable insights that you can apply to your personal and professional life.
