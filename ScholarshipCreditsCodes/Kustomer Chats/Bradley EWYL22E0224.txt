12/07/22, 23:21 - Bradley EWYL22E0224: -what i learned from the Wednesday lesson is that it is never too late to do something. I learned this because i was able to know that because Dami was challenged to change her organisation from a not-for profit to a profitable organisation in 5 days. She gladly accepted this and went straight down to work with her team, friends and mentors. I also learned that recently Skooqs has partnered with edoofian and this will ensure more benefits to students under edoofa and also employment opportunities. It is great to have an organisation such as skooqs as it helps children gain technological expertise in different fields.

13/07/22, 22:47 - Unknown: Good afternoon *BRADLEY*!
How's your day going?
13/07/22, 22:58 - Unknown: I read your response and I must say that your opinions and views reflect clarity of idea. Not just this, your simplified understanding of our  young African entrepreneur,
*Oluwadamilola Soyombo* assures me that you have that zeal and passion to turn your dreams and ambitions into a _big successful reality_. 
The main idea behind this is to you realize that where there is a DESIRE to work hard, there is always a PATH that can take you to favorable outcomes. I know you are putting in all your efforts and I very well appreciate them, but I know you are capable to do much more than this, it is just about taking one more step ahead of others that will make you outshine in this crowd of millions of people.
This project also highlighted Edoofa's Training and Development partner Skooqs.
13/07/22, 23:03 - Unknown: Bradley also since now you are over with your visa process I hope you will complete your weekend activity too and submit me the response by the end of the day.

14/07/22, 21:04 - Bradley EWYL22E0224: -This week’s Wednesday’s wisdom talks about Patrice Motsipe, a successful black entrepreneur. It goes on to talk about how he went about to get where he is right now in life. We also learn that through learning, hard work, the right support, commitment and putting in the work, one can become anything they want to become in life. This story is also inspiring as it shows the lengths to which Patrice Motsipe had to go through to be where he is right now. From working in a spaza shop and being the son of a former teacher to making billions is some wild achievement. A lot of students can learn from Patrice Motsipe including myself also.
15/07/22, 01:06 - Unknown: Hello Bradley!
How's your day going?
15/07/22, 01:07 - Unknown: I read your response BRADLEY and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a way. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. With can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.

18/07/22, 18:55 - Bradley EWYL22E0224: -In response to my weekend activity, the fastest growing sector in my country has to be the export growth in horticulture. Horticulture is the fastest growing agricultural sector in the country and the second largest foreign exchange earner in the country after tobacco. During the 2020\/2021 season, the government allowed private sectors to fund agricultural activities which since then improved the transparency of the sector. The government has taken steps to promote cultivation of sorghum and millet which are more ecologically compatible with the country’s semi-arid areas. The country also has 4 130 000 hectares of arable land, 25 percent of which is cultivated using animal and manual draught power. One of the weaknesses of this sector even though it’s the fastest growing one in the country is that Following the government’s fast track land reform program which began in 2000, irrigation infrastructure deteriorated and the new majority holders of land depend on rain rather than irrigation for their crops. As the weather changes and the droughts become more frequent, the country has failed to produce enough grain to supply domestic demand. Opportunities in this sector are that of US companies. US companies can supply agricultural companies with high quality tractors to local farmers under the country’s high agricultural mechanisation drive. In addition, given frequent droughts, irrigation equipment, equipment that can improve water use efficiency and the introduction of drought resistance crops can help the sector especially small-scale commercial  farmers move away from rain fed agriculture.
18/07/22, 22:38 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Bradley!
How did your weekend go?
18/07/22, 22:38 - Bradley EWYL22E0224: -my weekend was well, thank you
18/07/22, 22:38 - Bradley EWYL22E0224: -how was yours ?
18/07/22, 22:40 - Unknown: I am so amazed to see your response, Bradley. Horticulture is Zimbabwe's fifth-largest agricultural export earner, contributing 6.5% to the agricultural GDP (Table 2). Production of horticultural crops is mainly conducted close to major urban centers and along roads connected to urban settlements both at large and small scale.
With your response, I realized how can the horticulture industry can use its strength to its fullest to lower the risks from its threats.
18/07/22, 22:41 - Unknown: My weekend went well, thanks for asking.
18/07/22, 22:41 - Unknown: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader. 
Also Bradley, along with the SWOT analysis of a company, I would appreciate it if you also share a SWOT analysis of yourself. I want to see how much more you have learned beyond this activity.
18/07/22, 22:58 - Bradley EWYL22E0224: -Thank you.
18/07/22, 23:02 - Bradley EWYL22E0224: -A SWOT analysis of myself. 

S-one of my strengths is that I’m able to adapt really quick to new surroundings. 
W-my weakness is wrong decision making 
O-opportunities I have right now are to finish my higher education in India and move one step closer to my dream of making it 
T-one of the threats i face is my financial background which may disturb me in achieving my dream.

How's your day going?
21/07/22, 23:28 - Unknown: I am so happy and proud to see your enthusiasm and fire towards our daily ritual and your understanding of what being a proud edoofian denotes.?
21/07/22, 23:32 - Unknown: Also I went through your SWOT analysis and I must say that not everyone is capable of recognizing their weaknesses this is good wait, who said you take wrong decisions? Don't you think that choosing this EWYL program and becoming a part of the EDOOFA family was your best decision? Yes, it is. So don't worry and keep growing and learning each day Bradley.
21/07/22, 23:32 - Unknown: Along with this, let's move on with our session.
Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our WEDNESDAY Wisdom was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
22/07/22, 04:28 - Bradley EWYL22E0224: -sorry for missing our session today. I was travelling to South Africa as I’m preparing to come to India on Sunday.
22/07/22, 17:07 - Unknown: Good morning Bradley!
22/07/22, 17:07 - Unknown: How are your preparations going?
22/07/22, 17:14 - Unknown: I totally understand that Bradley, you must be so occupied in your preparation because you will be leaving your Homeland for such a long duration, and of course, you have to make sure that you are fully prepared and loaded with all the necessities. Take your time Bradley, and you always know that I am not just your mentor imparting you with knowledge and skills on a daily basis but my role is also to understand you as a friend and provide you with solutions to all your concerns and queries. 
I can understand that submitting a response at times can be difficult but I want us to stay connected every day. So I feel the best solution to it is that every day you come to the EWYL Line and follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud EDOOFIAN'. In this way, we will stay connected each day and I will be able to have quick updates on your preparation and progress. What do you think?
22/07/22, 17:15 - Bradley EWYL22E0224: -good morning. I am a proud edoofian.

25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.

25/07/22, 20:15 - Bradley EWYL22E0224: -In response to my Saturday activity, I’m here to talk about the growth mindset of successful people and how i can develop the same mindset. Successful people with growth mindsets often realise that success is all about and the result of the right attitude and hard work. Successful people are often motivated and inspired by people who have been successful before and achieved great things. They also have a genuine appreciation for the accomplishments of others and they think about the factors that helped them breakthrough. Growth minded people are not afraid to challenge themselves, What they do is that they embrace them. In simple terms, we have to challenge ourselves in order for us to improve and be better. Successful people often see failure as an opportunity to grow. When people with growth mindsets fail, they don’t take it personally instead they learn from their mistakes and keep a positive attitude to come back stronger next time. Failure is never final unless one decides to give up. Persistence is the key to overcoming adversity and achieving goals.
26/07/22, 18:13 - Unknown: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

Yesterday I had an amazing day. I went to the airport to receive all my proud Edoofians and I had tears in my eyes seeing their happiness and enthusiasm. I want you to look at it and share your thoughts with me.
26/07/22, 18:14 - Unknown: I read your understanding of the activity and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it’s not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you’re looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don’t do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.

29/07/22, 01:51 - Bradley EWYL22E0224: -In response to the learning of my Wednesday wisdom, I’ve noticed that time management is an important aspect in our lives. Time management does not only ensure that our tasks are done on time but also makes sure that everything in our lives is in order. As mentioned in the Wednesday wisdom passage, one can do everything productively and efficiently but still not get everything done in time, so this is where time managements comes in. As also mentioned that grouping tasks into urgent and important matters might be of use also. This should help set your priorities straight and help you get things done accordingly.

How's your day going?
29/07/22, 22:01 - Unknown: Your response to the Wednesday wisdom has made me realize our childhood quote  is Money'.
Through Wednesday Wisdom, my main aim was to educate my Edoofians about TIME MANAGEMENT and HOW IT CAN BE ACHIEVED.
You know are very well aware of what Time management means, let me tell you about what Time Management includes:

#Effective Planning
# Setting goals and objectives
# Setting deadlines
# Delegation of responsibilities
# Prioritizing activities as per their importance
# Spending the right time on the right activity

The benefits of Time Management are:
- Time Management makes an individual punctual and disciplined.
- One becomes more organized as a result of effective Time Management.
- Individuals who stick to a time plan are the ones who realize their goals and objectives within the shortest possible period. 
- Research says that individuals who accomplish tasks on time are less prone to stress and anxiety. 

How can we achieve it:
# Set a goal for yourself.
# Priority matrix (like we talked about in the Wednesday lesson)
# Organize your study space
# Do a SWOT Analysis of yourself.

I am sure you will note all these things and imply in your day-to-day life and do share with me what changes you have felt.
