You are most welcome.

As we embark on today's session, let's kick-start our journey with a dose of inspiration from Jeff Bezos, the visionary founder of Amazon:

Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room
Now, what does this mean to you?
Imagine you're creating your personal brand every day. It's not just about how you see yourself; it's about the impression you leave on others. Whether you're in the classroom, chatting with friends, or pursuing your hobbies, you're shaping your brand—the way people perceive you.

So, let's dive into today's session with the mindset of crafting a brand that reflects your strengths, values, and aspirations. Together, we'll explore ways to amplify your unique qualities and set the stage for success, not just academically, but in every aspect of your lives.

Remember, each interaction, each achievement, contributes to your brand. Let's make it a story of growth, resilience, and positive impact!

09/12/23, 17:07 - Gugulethu EWYL23E0485: Saturday activity
09/12/23, 18:43 - Unknown: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

13/12/23, 14:40 - Unknown: *Happy Wednesday*🌻

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
Team EWYL
