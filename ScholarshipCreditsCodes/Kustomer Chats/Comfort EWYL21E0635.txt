12/07/22, 07:12 - Unknown: I read your response to the Wednesday lesson and I must say that your opinions and views reflect clarity of idea. Not just this, your simplified understanding of our  young African entrepreneur,
*Oluwadamilola Soyombo* assures me that you have that zeal and passion to turn your dreams and ambitions into a _big successful reality_. 
The main idea behind this is to realize that where there is a DESIRE to work hard, there is always a PATH that can take you to favorable outcomes. I know you are putting in all your efforts and I very well appreciate them, but I know you are capable to do much more than this, it is just about taking one more step ahead of others that will make you outshine in this crowd of millions of people.
This project also highlighted Edoofa's Training and Development partner Skooqs.

12/07/22, 19:30 - Comfort EWYL21E0635: Name: Kwangware Comfort 
Date : July 12
Work done on Project 2: I have connected with a lot of school for the past two weeks  and I’m compiling the responses given by two Schools and I’m going to share them today
Challenges: have not received responses from schools which Promised to respond

Name :Kwangware Comfort 
Date : July 12
Work done on the IndianDoc Project: the message has reached out to a lot of people who are asking out for the IndianDoc Flier or the Posters
12/07/22, 19:30 - Comfort EWYL21E0635: I think One of the skills that a student must possess inorder to be given the chance to participate in projects is determination. One should be motivated, im 
Every activity that they are carrying out, the anxiety of 
Completing each task is also mandatory which may be able to provide a student with more Projects 




In addition, punctuality. As simple as it sounds, but plays a greater role in the success of a student. Early arrival during sessions shows how motivated and how much prepared a student is to take a step further.


Moreover,  a student must practice time management. We are given tasks by parents and Mentors, I’m sure a student  has got an allocated time for a session, and we need to create a time table to enable the flow of our daily activities properly without disturbances.

Furthermore, EFFORT. There is nothing much more interesting to the Mentors and Counselors than seeing how much effort a student is putting towards an activity. Even if you fail you keep getting up, persistence is vital, just Like what we Learnt from Mr Tosin, successful people fail a couple of times, but what separates them from the rest is that they, rise up and redo the failed activity till it is a Success.


Communication is another skill and or practice that a student must have and or do. The reason why Mentors require a project report 5 minutes prior to the Session time I think it is because the are evaluating a student on their communication Skill. And I’m very sure that students with this quality are very much likely to get more challenging projects
12/07/22, 19:31 - Comfort EWYL21E0635: Good Morning Ma’am 
I’m here for the session

13/07/22, 16:57 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

How's your day going?
13/07/22, 22:13 - Unknown: I was quite unwell for past few days and because of that I could not revert back to your updates, I am sorry for that.
13/07/22, 22:15 - Unknown: First of all Comfort, I am so happy that without fail you follow the ritual of being a proud EDOOFIAN. I am so glad to see that.
I feel so proud to be your mentor and to provide you a bit of guidance, I know you are yourself a great leader to sail the ship towards success.
13/07/22, 22:18 - Unknown: Secondly, I am really glad to hear your understanding of the activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY*. They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.
13/07/22, 22:20 - Unknown: Third, have you compiled the information given by the schools. If you are getting information on the schools, then it is the third project Comfort, not the second project.

3)Designation: School Principal
4)WhatsApp number: +263 77 500 7740
5)Mr Zarenyika used to be my Geography extra lessons teacher and I  approached him asking for help on how we can Improve our African education system and the following is what we discussed:
Offering of ict gadgets 
Use of internet fr research purposes
Make funding schools a Priority, the government may have to tax wealthier citizens to give funding to Local Schools.  The Government May also have to sponsor schools to get them buses  for them to help those students in the remote areas to travel. After traveling a long distance students may be tired and learning becomes a bit difficult.
Teachers also need funding and support, this gives them the energy to drill students, lack of government support may result in teachers losing the power to teach. Yes To Improve the education sector there’s need to improve the infrastructure and other facilities, but what makes Education a Success are the students, the teachers and the infrastructure, so if we focus only on building infrastructure and not supporting the Students including the teachers, Education becomes impossible.

Lastly carriculum development and Classroom priorities should focus on each student’s individual success

Year of Establishment of the School: March 2022
 Fee structure for A level: $190US Commercials and Arts
Number of teachers: 12
A level Pass Percentage: the college started recently so no information yet
14/07/22, 07:48 - Comfort EWYL21E0635: Sorry Ma’am One more thing,
 

I have thought of:

PRINTING FLYERS OF THE IMAGES ABOVE.

@GIVE HANDOUTS TO PEOPLE SEEKING HEALTH PROBLEMS IN HOSPITALS .

@GIVE ADVICE CONCERNING YOUR PROJECT ON HOW IT (SAVES COSTS) as people will enjoy hearing the cheap part.

A , people's treatments in hospitals is becoming more expensive as health care services are also troublesome with some nurses and doctors striking because of low wages.

Hence I need to formulate a-date and time to accomplish these things .


On my free time I managed to find the closest hospitals within our areas including closest to my area that is Vainona.
14/07/22, 07:49 - Comfort EWYL21E0635: Sorry so my question here is, is there a time frame set for the IndianDoc Project?

Make sure the flyer is exact and to the point, but don't forget to mention the essential points  a health plan available at such low rates for the whole family. I hope we receive a positive and quick response from this.
Before getting the flyers printed, I would really appreciate it if you could show them to me. In case if there would be any error then I can correct you and we can have the best output.

How are you Comfort?
15/07/22, 21:21 - Unknown: From his dad’s small foray into entrepreneurship, Patrice Motsepe got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe’s success story is a remarkable one showing how curiosity, doggedness, perseverance, and the knack to exploit great opportunities as they come, can determine how successful or not, any individual could become. 
And this was all about our WEDNESDAY WISDOM.
Hope you have gone through it.
I am so excited to listen to your thoughts and views HERE.
15/07/22, 21:22 - Unknown: Did you get any response on the IndianDoc Project Comfort?
Please do give me an update.
15/07/22, 22:15 - Comfort EWYL21E0635: Driven by a lot of curiosity as a result of Miners storming each day at his Father’s Work Place, Patrice Motsepe grew the  love of mining. 

- [ ] The article indicated that Mr Motsepe was much focused on growth and high success, he  went on to do as much research on how Mining operates as he could. He chose a Career path linked to the mining sector that he so much Admired , till he was able to establish and purchase a mining firm for himself.  He became recognized as one of the most Successful business People in South Africa.

- [ ] What I learnt and understood from the Article in that, we all need  that motivational force to keep our hopes alive and to increase productivity. I’m very sure at some point Mr Motsepe had a few things that tried pulling him down, and nor do I know what kept on motivating him to reach out for his dream, but all that we need is to get inspiration. 

- [ ] Moreover, we all need to get so attached to our dreams, that  way we all can be who we dream of becoming.  Also  From the article I noted that we are our own super heroes, we are the ones who determine if our story is worth telling to people someday, to keep their hopes alive and never stop dreaming.

Mr Patrice Motsepe’s story has encouraged and woke my mindset up, I will keep on chasing my dreams and In the end my story will be used to motivate someone someday

Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a WAY. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. We can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.

19/07/22, 18:14 - Comfort EWYL21E0635: One of the fast growing Industries In Zimbabwe is the Tobacco industry.  Over the years Tobacco has been one of the most successful Indiustriesim Zimbabwe. Statistics say that in the Year 2000,  there were only 8500 Tobacco farmers and by the year 2018, there were 141000 Tobacco Farmers. Such development
Show how fast the Tobacco industry will grow for the coming years and or has grown over the past years.

Moreover, much of Zimbabwe's farmland went out of cultivation, and the tobacco crop bottomed out at 48 million kg in 2008, just 21% of the 2000 crop. Tobacco production in Zimbabwe hit record highs of 252 million kg in 2019 according to statistics from the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board.

From my Own Perception, I see the Tobacco Industry In Zimbabwe becoming one of the Top Recognized and on demand industries in the World. The Rapid growth of this industry has proven to be highly profitable. And where there is Profit this is where the Focus of a Country goes to. 

Here are some of the advantages of using Tobacco:
* You’ll have fresher breath, whiter teeth and better smelling hair and clothes.
* Your sense of smell with return to normal, and food will taste better.
* The discoloration of your fingers and fingernails will disappear.
* You’ll be able to do normal activities such as climb stairs, do house and yard work and keep up with your kids and grandkids without losing your breath.
* You’ll feel free to go to restaurants, theatres, sports arenas and other public facilities where smoking isn’t permitted.
* You won’t have to worry about exposing your family members and friends to your secondhand smoke.
* You will no longer spend time and energy worrying about when you’ll be able to get your next nicotine “fix.”

The Tobacco Industry May also be toxic to the Environment. Roughly 4.5 trillion cigarette filters pollute our oceans, rivers, city sidewalks, parks, soil and beaches every year,” said Dr Ruediger Krech, Di
19/07/22, 21:55 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Comfort!
How's your day going?
19/07/22, 22:00 - Unknown: I read your response Comfort and it made me very inquisitive to know more about the Tobacco industry.  I found that -  In recent years Zimbabwe has rapidly increased the size of its crop, regaining its spot as one of the world's top five exporters of tobacco. It exported just over 200 million kilograms (220,000 tons) of tobacco in 2021, according to the Tobacco Industry Marketing Board. 
Your response shows a detailed understanding of the industry and it is very impressive.
19/07/22, 22:01 - Unknown: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader. 
Also Comfort, along with the SWOT analysis of a company, I would appreciate it if you also share a SWOT analysis of yourself. I want to see how much more you have learned beyond this activity.
19/07/22, 22:02 - Unknown: Comfort also give me an update on the IndianDoc project as well.
