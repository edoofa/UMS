15/01/24, 13:34 - Tatenda EWYL23E0817: I dont know much but l only have an idea
15/01/24, 13:35 - Ananya: You know, a resume is like a super important paper for students. It shows all the cool things you've done in school and outside. When you want to get into a good school or get a job, you give them your resume so they can see how awesome you are. It's like your personal advertisement that says, 'Hey, I'm really good at these things, and I can do great stuff for you!' So, having a good resume helps you stand out and get cool opportunities.
15/01/24, 13:38 - Tatenda EWYL23E0817: Oooooooh wow thank you so much . I didnt know about resume . Please can you tell me more

15/01/24, 13:47 - Ananya: Now, please watch this video and create a resume by our next session. As of now, let us now discuss your EWYL project. Now moving ahead I want to discuss something significant with you. You know, seeing over 400 students in this event has motivated me to work for my students even harder. I want you to be here in India and pay your fee all by yourself. For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed with a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?

18/01/24, 13:13 - Tatenda EWYL23E0817: Yes maam we can

18/01/24, 13:32 - Ananya: Tatenda, I have noticed that you did not follow your EWYL ritual yesterday, and therefore, you have missed your Wednesday lesson. I hope you understand that it is crucial to follow your ritual on a daily basis; only then will you receive the lessons and activities! I hope you won't miss it next time.
18/01/24, 13:35 - Tatenda EWYL23E0817: Maam am sorry l didnt know that we were supposed  to do a lesson yesterday
18/01/24, 13:36 - Tatenda EWYL23E0817: I though we are now doing our sessions on Mondays and thursdays only . Please can you explain to me so that l can understand .
18/01/24, 13:47 - Ananya: Tatenda, you don't have a session on Wednesday; however, I hope you remember that we have a weekly lesson on Wednesday that we discuss on Thursday. This lesson can only be received by you if you follow your EWYL ritual.
18/01/24, 13:48 - Tatenda EWYL23E0817: Maam l am confused ü•∫am sorry can you explain for me more about this EWYL ritual
18/01/24, 13:52 - Ananya: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
18/01/24, 13:54 - Tatenda EWYL23E0817: So l text here or in our ewyl group
18/01/24, 13:58 - Ananya: Here, Tatenda! Well, you know, I was traveling to the office today, and there was a lot of traffic on the way. I got enough time to understand the skills that my students should have if they wish to succeed in their future, covering the basic skills through the EWYL project. However, I was wondering if my students understand the core of the EWYL projects or not! So, tell me, do you even understand the intent behind these projects or not? If yes, what's that?
18/01/24, 14:05 - Tatenda EWYL23E0817: Yes. This helps me to get different skills that will help in in future for example this EWYL program is helping to gain self confidence , getting to master communicationn skills. I can also say these projects are build  a leadership  skills inside me , l am so happy because of that
18/01/24, 14:05 - Tatenda EWYL23E0817: But you can also tell me more maam

20/01/24, 17:41 - Ananya: Greetings on this beautiful day‚ú®

Hello My Proud Edoofian,

Hope this message finds you well! This Saturday's activity is an exciting opportunity to delve deeper into the principles of the book 'Think and Grow Rich" by Napoleon Hill ' discussed in our Wednesday lesson. Each of you is required to elaborate on one of the seven principles shared in the Wednesday Lesson. Provide a detailed explanation, and don't forget to include examples to illustrate the practical application of the chosen principle.

This task is crucial as it will not only reinforce your understanding but also prepare you for our upcoming session with mentors. Remember, the more detailed and insightful your submission, the more enriching the discussion will be.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarification. Looking forward to your insightful contributions!

Best,
Team EWYL
