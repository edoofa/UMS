24/08/23, 17:38 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, In the Earn While You Learn Program, the credits you earn are primarily designated to cover your tuition fees. Once you've successfully earned enough to fully cover your tuition fees, any additional funds you earn can be utilized for your personal use. However, it's important to emphasize that the initial priority is to ensure that your tuition fees are completely paid.
24/08/23, 17:40 - Natasha EWYL23E0372: Okay l fully get that part
24/08/23, 17:40 - Jasmine Kaur: Sorry what?
24/08/23, 17:41 - Natasha EWYL23E0372: So it's only when the tuition fee has been completely covered it's then the credits are used for personal use
24/08/23, 17:41 - Natasha EWYL23E0372: The tuition fee for a semester right
24/08/23, 17:41 - Natasha EWYL23E0372: So if it's not completely covered you wont have money for personal use
24/08/23, 17:42 - Natasha EWYL23E0372: Is it actually possible to cover the tuition fee
24/08/23, 17:43 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, After the fees are fully covered, You can use the rest of the money to get something which will help you in your growth and not personal use.

29/08/23, 19:45 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

Hope you are doing well, I would like to announce that tomorrow is a holiday on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan which is an auspicious Indian Festival so I am sharing the lesson with you today!

So for this week's Wednesday lesson,  I have an exciting topic to delve into: Hidden Talent.
We'll dive into the captivating story of Samuel, a character whose seemingly ordinary life takes a fascinating turn when his secret talent comes to light. Through his story, we'll discover the power of talents that lie beneath the surface, waiting for the perfect moment to shine.
So, bring your curiosity and imagination as we delve into Samuel's tale and discuss the significance of hidden talents in our own lives. You might even find yourself reflecting on your own unique abilities that are yet to be revealed.

In our upcoming session I would like to know if you have a hidden talent that you're particularly good at or passionate about? It could be anything – from artistic pursuits to something more unexpected.

Get ready to be inspired, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together!
