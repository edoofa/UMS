How are you?

May I please know your EWYL Group name for better clarity and communication?
04/10/23, 15:38 - Makanaka EWYL22E0814: Good day
04/10/23, 15:38 - Makanaka EWYL22E0814: It's for Makanaka Murengwe
04/10/23, 17:56 - Saloni Rastogi: Okay, got you!
04/10/23, 17:56 - Saloni Rastogi: Before we begin, as you have come on the EWYL Line, you have already completed some basic formalities. Now, I would like to talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.

I kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let me know.
04/10/23, 18:22 - Makanaka EWYL22E0814: The student is at school and will be home most likely around the 25th of November so I think it's best to continue when she comes back.
05/10/23, 14:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are well.

I have noted the details, thank you!
05/10/23, 14:55 - Makanaka EWYL22E0814: Welcome. Thank you
