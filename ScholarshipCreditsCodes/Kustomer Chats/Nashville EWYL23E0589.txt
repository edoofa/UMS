16/09/23, 16:49 - Nashville EWYL23E0589: Before an upcoming  examination, l tend to research more on the topics that are expected  to appear in the examinations so as to broaden up my knowledge.  Also group discussions  help in cementing information as there will be a diversity of answers on a particular topic , also jotting down points in a notebook whilst reading helps in revision as you will be able to revise in a more efficient  way , Preventing the habbit of studying on the onset of an exam and studying  1 week or 2 week before as ur mind will be more relaxed
