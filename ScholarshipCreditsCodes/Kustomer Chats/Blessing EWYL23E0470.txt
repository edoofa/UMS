07/09/23, 16:09 - Ananya: What are your thoughts on that?
07/09/23, 16:18 - Blessing EWYL23E0470: My thoughts are that : you  can make your dreams come true if you believe and work hard . 
And that as young people we can gain encouragement from seeing other people's achievements .
They become our role models the desire to be just like them . Being successful in what they do . 

Sending a message to young people that to chase ones dreams .you need to work hard
Adapt to situations and find a way to work better around them 
Be resilient never give up
And among other things a strong support network 
Really helps you and uplifts you . Gives you courage to keep going regardless of the challenges
07/09/23, 16:20 - Ananya: I completely agree with your thoughts! Belief and hard work are indeed essential ingredients for turning dreams into reality. Role models can provide valuable inspiration and motivation, showing us that success is achievable.

07/09/23, 16:33 - Blessing EWYL23E0470: Thank you ma'am
07/09/23, 16:36 - Ananya: Where are we on the projects?
07/09/23, 16:40 - Blessing EWYL23E0470: Still far from achieving the the end goal

07/09/23, 17:06 - Blessing EWYL23E0470: I'm working on it ma'am 
Marketing the Edoofa program to students takes time . Some just don't want to study abroad . Or are scared

07/09/23, 17:15 - Blessing EWYL23E0470: Yes ma'am
