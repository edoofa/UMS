01/10/22, 20:51 - Casandra EWYL21E0510: As it was discussed at the Edoofian orientation I know and understood it
01/10/22, 20:51 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

How are you?
09/10/22, 15:51 - Unknown: Hello *My Proud Edoofian*!

Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. Those unfamiliar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.
Responses will be accepted on the *EWYL Line* only.
_Till then keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'_.

Happy learning and enjoy your weekend!

13/10/22, 12:30 - Casandra EWYL21E0510: As for my Wednesday wisdom,
I learnt about the path Wode maya took ,the patience and consistency he had not forgetting the passion and hard work he puts until he became successful and also learnt that impossibility can rise up against you and come your way but if you set up your goals nothing fails just like how his channel grew from 0-a million viewers .

13/10/22, 22:16 - Unknown: Greetings Casandra!
How are you?
13/10/22, 22:17 - Unknown: We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In the session on the EWYL Line, we will:
1) discuss on the Wednesday lesson
2) project analysis
3) video to be shared as a part of the weekend activity
13/10/22, 22:18 - Unknown: I agree with you on what you think about the Wednesday lesson, that hard work and struggle are somewhat inherited parts of the journey that leads us to success.
The lesson was an important platform to make us realize the importance of social media Casandra. Through these platforms, like Instagram, Facebook, Youtube, LinkedIn, etc, we can shape our careers and profile, like the example shared in the lesson.
13/10/22, 22:18 - Unknown: Along with this, I have an amazing opportunity for you, but I will share with you only when you will share with me the video that was to be sent for the weekend activity.
13/10/22, 22:18 - Unknown: I have this opportunity reserved just for you, exclusively for my bright students.

25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:06 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off
