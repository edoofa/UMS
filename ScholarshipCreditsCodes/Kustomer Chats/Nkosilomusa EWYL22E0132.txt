20/07/22, 20:43 - Nkosilomusa EWYL22E0132: I am sorry maam, I was a little bit tied up with school work
20/07/22, 20:45 - Jasmine Kaur: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

20/07/22, 21:03 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings Nkosie, I understand that you were at school so you could not respond but again you have not been responding to my text messages as well.
20/07/22, 21:04 - Jasmine Kaur: Also, edoofian you have not been following *I am a proud edoofian*
 I am your mentor *Ms.Riva* and I will help you cover everything as well.
 But, my proud edoofian you need to be consistent and loyal for me to trust you.
 You have to work with me and you have to prove yourself because only then I would be able to help.

21/07/22, 16:31 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my proud hope you are doing well,. We are back with another Wednesday wisdom. I am sure you will agree to the fact that Attitude plays a major role in our day-to-day life. It is also a waste of time if the proper attitude and effective abilities are not developed. In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we discuss a crucial character quality that everyone should work on and make sure they have mastered the right attitude. Once you have read the full lesson, We will be having the discussion concerning the same in our next session. Write down if you have any questions or key observations from the lesson. 

Happy learning!
21/07/22, 16:33 - Jasmine Kaur: Before we move forward I want you to be clear on the importance of us connecting daily.
25/07/22, 03:15 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:06 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off

14/12/22, 21:41 - Jasmine Kaur: Wednesday lesson:


Christmas is celebrated by people all across the world, whether they are Christians or non Christians. Christmas is the perfect time when friends and families come together, spreading joy and happiness.You must be aware of the concept of \"SECRET SANTA,\" but do you know who he or she was, or how the lovely process of sharing joy began? In today's Wednesday Wisdom, let's find out more about the secret Santa. The secret Santa has a special message for you at the end. We'll get in touch and discuss your takeaways in more detail.

Happy learning and smiling!
15/12/22, 00:13 - Nkosilomusa EWYL22E0132: I understood that secret santa is played among individuals.
It was inverted by santa who helped Larry ( a homeless, hungry and broke man ) and other individuals but he did not tell them his real name but just encourage them to do the same to people in need.  Santa moved in,cities in America with this random acts of kindness and and the SECRET SANTA spread over the whole world by individuals who helped those in need.
Individuals helped those in need with money and other items. 
Those helped also remembered those who helped them and would give a token,of appriciation to those who helped them even after a long period of time.
This random act of kindness continued from the 1970s up to now
15/12/22, 17:55 - Jasmine Kaur: Rise and shine this morning edoofian,
I hope you are having a good day!


Here is the quote for today:

 I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. –Michael Jordan
15/12/22, 17:55 - Jasmine Kaur: After receiving and opening your present, you must guess who you think your Secret Santa is. Finding out who picked your name while hiding your own identity as someone’s Secret Santa makes this Christmas tradition exciting and enjoyable between families, friends, and peers.
Don’t you think so?

I like to ponder a lot, and with it comes brainstorming, prototyping, and ideation techniques. How does the idea of meeting a CEO, knowing about their journey, and contemplating how success came to them sound? Interesting, right? Not yet?

Then perhaps you would like to know about how brands are developed, how they scale, how they flourish, and what goes into making a company from scratch to something of impeccable scale. In this webinar not only business ideations and strategies will be discussed but also brand development, moreover, our featured industry professional is profound in advertising, content marketing, and marketing research too. Who knows, something might catch your eye or let you discover your field of interest by just listening to the different structures of a company. I would genuinely implore you to give this a chance and see for yourself whether the seats we worth taking.

24/12/22, 23:00 - Jasmine Kaur: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

09/01/23, 19:13 - Jasmine Kaur: Good day my proud edoofian,
How are you doing today?
I am sure you had an amazing new years.

Let us start our day with a beautiful quote  need to accept that we won’t always make the right decisions, that we’ll screw up royally sometimes―understanding that failure is not the opposite of success, it’s part of success.

I feel we have missed a lot due to the holiday season so we will be having a detailed session today, you are suggested to be *active* to avoid any delays.

 *Did you get the company form filled by Mr.Anesu?
