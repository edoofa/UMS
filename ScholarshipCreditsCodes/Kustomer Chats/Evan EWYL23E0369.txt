 Start your Monday with strength, embrace the week with passion.

One small positive thought can transform your whole day. Let's conquer this week! 
29/08/23, 20:08 - Unknown: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture ‚Äì the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 20:08 - Unknown: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.
29/08/23, 20:09 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

Hope you are doing well, I would like to announce that tomorrow is a holiday on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan which is an auspicious Indian Festival so I am sharing the lesson with you today!

So for this week's Wednesday lesson,  I have an exciting topic to delve into: Hidden Talent.
We'll dive into the captivating story of Samuel, a character whose seemingly ordinary life takes a fascinating turn when his secret talent comes to light. Through his story, we'll discover the power of talents that lie beneath the surface, waiting for the perfect moment to shine.
So, bring your curiosity and imagination as we delve into Samuel's tale and discuss the significance of hidden talents in our own lives. You might even find yourself reflecting on your own unique abilities that are yet to be revealed.

In our upcoming session I would like to know if you have a hidden talent that you're particularly good at or passionate about? It could be anything ‚Äì from artistic pursuits to something more unexpected.

Get ready to be inspired, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together!

19/09/23, 16:33 - Unknown: Fantastic! Let's make this session a productive one.
19/09/23, 16:33 - Unknown: Now that you are late for the session - let's shift attention to the three projects we've been discussing, particularly the

Community Building and African School Reforms initiatives.
19/09/23, 16:33 - Unknown: Could you provide an  update on the Community Building project? What progress have you made?
19/09/23, 16:33 - Unknown: How many community-building forms have you successfully completed, and what is the typical number of students you have engaged with on average?
19/09/23, 16:38 - Evan EWYL23E0369: Have not made much progress as am now preparing for my exams
19/09/23, 16:42 - Unknown: Hey there! I totally understand that preparing for exams can be a big deal, and it's essential to focus on your studies. But let me tell you about something cool that can actually help you during this busy time ‚Äì working on your community building project during your free time.
Here's why it can be a great idea:

1. Mental Break: When you're studying a lot, taking a break and doing something different can be like a breath of fresh air for your brain. Working on your community Building project can be a way to relax your mind for a little while.

2. Financial Boost: Woking on your community Building projects can also help you earn scholarship credits. So, not only are you taking a break, but you're also adding to your finances, which can be super helpful.

3. Time Management Skills: Balancing your exam prep, community project, and free time is a bit like learning a new skill. It's like figuring out how to manage your time wisely, which is a skill that will be handy in the future.
19/09/23, 16:42 - Unknown: Do you agree with me Evan?
19/09/23, 16:44 - Evan EWYL23E0369: Yes am sorry I had quite neglected time management will fix that during this week
19/09/23, 16:55 - Unknown: Okay Evan
19/09/23, 16:56 - Unknown: Now I want to set a target and I will also send a plan to achieve that target.
This is regarding the community building project so are you ready for that?
19/09/23, 16:58 - Evan EWYL23E0369: Ok let's try it out
19/09/23, 17:03 - Unknown: Plan:

1. Target Identification: Identify specific groups of students who may benefit from Edoofa, such as those interested in higher education abroad or scholarships.

2. Elevator Pitch: Prepare a concise and persuasive pitch about Edoofa, highlighting its benefits, scholarship opportunities, and how it can help them achieve their educational goals.

3. Use Online Platforms: Leverage social media, student forums, and educational groups to connect with potential students. Share Edoofa's mission and the link to the forms.
19/09/23, 17:04 - Unknown: 4. Personal Outreach: Encourage one-on-one conversations with classmates, friends, and acquaintances, explaining how Edoofa can assist them in their educational journey.

5. Time Management: Allocate specific hours each day or week for outreach and follow-ups. Create a schedule to ensure consistent efforts.

6. Follow-Up: Maintain a record of contacted students and regularly follow up with reminders, additional information, or answers to questions.
19/09/23, 17:04 - Unknown: 7. Progress Tracking: Keep a log of interactions, the number of forms distributed, and the number of filled forms received to track progress toward the goal.
19/09/23, 17:05 - Unknown: Evan what do you think about the plan and target?
19/09/23, 17:06 - Unknown: Evan, I see all the potential in you. I hope you understand the purpose behind doing these projects as when you connect with people in the community and passionately explain, you master a valuable set of skills that contribute to your personal growth and community development.
19/09/23, 17:07 - Evan EWYL23E0369: Yes am seeing the purpose will do accordingly won't disappoint
19/09/23, 17:07 - Evan EWYL23E0369: Its good
19/09/23, 17:16 - Unknown: You enhance all the following skills

Public Speaking Confidence: Explaining your organization to others, whether one-on-one or in larger groups, boosts your confidence in public speaking. This skill is invaluable in various aspects of life and career.

Problem-Solving: Engaging with the community often involves addressing questions or concerns. This nurtures your problem-solving skills as you find solutions to potential obstacles.
19/09/23, 17:17 - Unknown: Leadership Development: Taking the initiative to connect and share your organization's mission positions you as a leader within your community. This leadership experience can open doors to new opportunities and responsibilities.
19/09/23, 17:17 - Unknown: Objectivity of the Target:

Connecting with others in the community to explain your organization is not just about promoting your cause; it's about fostering a sense of community, addressing needs, and making a positive impact. Your objective is to create a win-win situation where both you and the community benefit.
19/09/23, 17:17 - Unknown: As we are reaching the end of our session, I would like to reiterate the targets for you before our next session -
20/09/23, 13:45 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian Evan, Hope you are doing well!

29/09/23, 16:19 - Unknown: Welcome to our follow-up session. I hope you've had a productive week! Today, we'll dive into the objectives and progress of our Community Building Project. I want to make sure you understand the goals clearly, discuss your achievements, and set new targets. Let's get started!
29/09/23, 16:19 - Unknown: Evan, First, let's revisit the objective. In the Community Building Project, our aim is to contact 40 other students and collect at least 20 filled forms. This project is about fostering a sense of community and involvement among our peers and most importantly learning the skills to speak with confidence and conviction infront of people.
29/09/23, 16:20 - Evan EWYL23E0369: Yes that is so
29/09/23, 16:25 - Unknown: Now that you have got the forms/ sooner or later be getting them -


Please  make sure the students are completely aware of what Edoofa is and what it does and even the admission stages.

If the student goes to the admission counselor and denies that his/her friend did not discuss anything about Edoofa then you will not earn any scholarship credits.
29/09/23, 16:25 - Unknown: To be on a safer side. Connect with the students on WhatsApp personally. Once they fill the form. Then give them resources and information about Edoofa.


Train them about the process so they are informed completely when the admission counselors will contact them and also, we will have proof that yes you have explained it all.
29/09/23, 16:25 - Unknown: Along with that make sure you are giving them an explanation about your journey, about the benefits that you have got and about the skills that you will be acquiring in the process.
29/09/23, 16:26 - Evan EWYL23E0369: Notes
29/09/23, 16:26 - Evan EWYL23E0369: Noted
29/09/23, 16:33 - Unknown: Use Time Wisely: It's important to manage our time wisely when promoting something like the Edoofa scholarship program. Honesty is key, and we should avoid exaggerations or lies to attract others.

Involve Your Parents: You can ask your parents to support you by sharing their pride in your achievements with Edoofa. They can put up a photo of you or the Edoofa offer letter, along with a message about how proud they are of your accomplishments. This adds authenticity to your message.
Their status might attract their other peers or connections and they might inquire about it and they might also be interested for their child as well.
This saves your time as well

Unique Edoofa: Edoofa is a unique organization, and you can share what personally attracted you to it. Think about what stood out to you and made you interested in their scholarship program.
29/09/23, 16:53 - Unknown: Are you following the discussion?
29/09/23, 16:53 - Evan EWYL23E0369: Yes
29/09/23, 16:57 - Unknown: Subsidized Education: Make it crystal clear that Edoofa's scholarship program require you to pay fees.

It is not fully free. Instead, it offers the opportunity to study in Indian institutions at a subsidized rate. This means a more affordable education.
29/09/23, 16:57 - Unknown: Highlight India's Education: India is known for its exceptional education system. Mention the 24/7 electricity availability, which ensures a conducive learning environment. Also, highlight the 24/7 library access, which is great for studying and research, and the reliable internet connection, which is essential for education today.
29/09/23, 16:57 - Unknown: Edoofa's Support: Emphasize that Edoofa doesn't just provide a scholarship and leave you on your own. They offer assistance throughout your entire college journey, from enrollment to the end of your college experience. This support can be invaluable.
