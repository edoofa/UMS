06/10/22, 19:53 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

How are you?
09/10/22, 16:21 - Aditi Kapoor: Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. Those unfamiliar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.
Responses will be accepted on the *EWYL Line* only.
_Till then keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'_.

Happy learning and enjoy your weekend!

How are you?
20/10/22, 21:10 - Aditi Kapoor: Did you form the WhatsApp Group as informed by me yesterday on the call?
20/10/22, 21:10 - Aditi Kapoor: I am happy to tell you that this weekend we are having our great Indian festival, Deepawali and you know this festival holds a special place in the hearts of all Indian families. So yesterday, everyone in our office wore Ethnic dresses and celebrate Deepawali's party where we exchanged gifts and lit up the office with diyas and candles.
Due to this, there was a delay in sending you the Wednesday lesson for this week.
Please see to it and we will have a session tomorrow on the same because I want to give you time to ponder and work on it.
20/10/22, 21:10 - Aditi Kapoor: In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. what have you learned about the Deepawali festival so far :fireworks: 

I am excited to discuss both things with you!

Along with this, please follow the daily ritual without any reminders.

05/11/22, 00:54 - Shamyce EWYL22E0339: OK noted
05/11/22, 00:59 - Aditi Kapoor: Please do share with me once you go through it.
05/11/22, 01:19 - Shamyce EWYL22E0339: The Wednesday wisdom is about a saying \"winners never give up\". There is an example of African community called Siddis who came here for work. They ended up becoming rulers of certain states in India. Malik Ambar who was one of the most prominent people became prime minister, and military leader and then kingmaker. As a community they kept on growing and expanding and this showed that they never gave up.

08/11/22, 00:08 - Aditi Kapoor: I would like to share this weekend's activity with you.
It is actually very amazing :gift-box:
08/11/22, 00:08 - Aditi Kapoor: “My job is not to be easy on people. My job is to make them better.”- Steve Jobs

And till now, our founder Mr. Angad has always been a guiding light for everyone at Edoofa. And has made sure we all turn out to be future leaders in our fields, no matter how hard it seems, we should keep moving with single harmony toward our goals and motives. But, leadership can not only be taught, as it is not a literary subject, but a practical life experience that is to be taken up, practiced, and bettered with each passing day.

Hence, after the very encouraging Wednesday lesson on how good leadership and patience can change a community's entire ideology and perception to grow back from the ashes. Today's Activity is going to give you a first-hand experience to fit yourselves in a small part of the leadership shoes. I want you to create a newsletter of your own. Similar to the ones you have enjoyed reading every Sunday from the founder's office.

Your Newsletter should consider the following things:  Quotes that have been motivating you for some time now, or your three favorite quotes which motivate you to be better every day.
and,
2. One story of your idol, that can be any person, who according to you has contributed to making the community and world a better place for people to live. The story should also consist of a part stating the reason why they are your idol.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own capabilities while performing this activity.

The best newsletters of the week shall be shared with all the fellow edoofians next week.
08/11/22, 00:09 - Aditi Kapoor: I am sharing a sample newsletter with you.
Use it just for reference.
09/11/22, 22:30 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Shanyce!

I hope you are doing well. This message serves as a gentle reminder for your Wednesday lesson. It is important to continue learning and developing your skills in order to advance in your career. Please take some time to go through the lesson, take notes on any important information, and complete the assigned tasks. Remember, investing in yourself is always a wise decision.
