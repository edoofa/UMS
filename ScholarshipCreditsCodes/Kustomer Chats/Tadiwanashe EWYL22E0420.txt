The feedback we have received from some of you on this week‚Äôs Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.

What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he‚Äôd received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he‚Äôd paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

‚ÄúYour honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,‚Äù he replied.

‚ÄúHow do you weight the butter then?‚Äù Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

‚ÄúYour honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I‚Äôve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it‚Äôs the baker.‚Äù

14/03/23, 18:42 - Tenzin: So did he change the number?
14/03/23, 19:01 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0420: I think so
14/03/23, 19:03 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0420: So on the first project I'm trying to reach out to companies online buy failing to get responses especially via LinkedIn

14/03/23, 19:09 - Tenzin: Yes
14/03/23, 19:09 - Tenzin: So can you tell me how you have been trying to connect to the companies over linkedin?
14/03/23, 20:48 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0420: I started by doing background research about the company and then start looking for employees in those companies which are on linkedin
14/03/23, 21:08 - Tenzin: Hello Tadiwanashe
14/03/23, 21:09 - Tenzin: That's great progress!
14/03/23, 21:09 - Tenzin: So can you tell me if you have found those companies as SMEs
14/03/23, 23:11 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0420: For now I've got one but their networth is less than 1milion
14/03/23, 23:18 - Tenzin: Well that is again very low
14/03/23, 23:26 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0420: So the companies I'm supposed to look for must be very big right
14/03/23, 23:34 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0420: Also in terms of the 3rd project ,can you highlight what I'm going to tell the principals about Edoofa ?  For example, how you're going to assist them in your partnership?
14/03/23, 23:38 - Tenzin: Yes I will highlight you and guide you but you have to complete the projects one by one
14/03/23, 23:39 - Tenzin: The companies has to be SMEs
14/03/23, 23:42 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0420: Noted
14/03/23, 23:43 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0420: Can SMEs have a networth more than 1million
14/03/23, 23:46 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0420: What about supermarkets with different branches ,do you need them in your partnership ?
14/03/23, 23:47 - Tenzin: Yes, it is possible for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to have a net worth more than 1 million. The net worth of an SME is the difference between its total assets and its total liabilities. If an SME has significant assets such as property, equipment, inventory, and cash, and relatively low liabilities, it can have a net worth of more than 1 million.

Many successful SMEs, especially those that have been in business for a long time and have experienced steady growth, can have a net worth well beyond 1 million. It is also important to note that the net worth of an SME can fluctuate over time depending on its financial performance, market conditions, and other factors.
14/03/23, 23:48 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0420: Really!
14/03/23, 23:48 - Tenzin: Yes!
14/03/23, 23:50 - Tenzin: Here are some examples of successful SMEs with net worths of more than 1 million:

Warby Parker  American online retailer of prescription glasses and sunglasses. As of 2021, it has a net worth of over $3 billion.

Sugarfina  luxury candy retailer based in the United States. As of 2021, it has a net worth of over $50 million.

Rent the Runway  American online service that provides designer dress and accessory rentals. As of 2021, it has a net worth of over $1 billion.

15/03/23, 18:33 - Tenzin: Hello my Proud Edoofian,
This week's Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the topic of \"Seeking Wealth, not Money or Status.\" This is an important lesson that will provide valuable insights into the pursuit of financial stability and success. During this lesson, we will explore the concept of wealth and its importance in building a sustainable financial future. We will discuss the difference between wealth, money, and status, and how each of these concepts plays a role in our lives.
I encourage you to read the lesson in detail and take notes to fully understand the material. It is important to engage with this topic and think critically about your own financial goals and aspirations.
By understanding the importance of seeking wealth over money or status, you can develop a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial success. I look forward to exploring this topic with you in more detail during our upcoming lesson.

Happy learning!","transform":"
