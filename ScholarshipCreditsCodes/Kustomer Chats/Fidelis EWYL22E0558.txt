28/09/23, 17:12 - Fidelis EWYL22E0558: Done
28/09/23, 17:20 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Fidelis!
How are you?
28/09/23, 17:20 - Fidelis EWYL22E0558: Am fine how about you saloni
28/09/23, 17:20 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing good, thank you.
28/09/23, 17:21 - Fidelis EWYL22E0558: Glad üòä
28/09/23, 17:22 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
28/09/23, 17:23 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù
28/09/23, 17:24 - Saloni Rastogi: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter

3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
28/09/23, 17:24 - Fidelis EWYL22E0558: Heard loud and clear ma'am
28/09/23, 17:26 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *12:00-01:30 PM*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
28/09/23, 17:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready for this journey?
28/09/23, 17:27 - Fidelis EWYL22E0558: Yes
28/09/23, 17:41 - Saloni Rastogi: Now we will continue on Saturday for the Saturday activity.
28/09/23, 17:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Our session comes to a close today, but the excitement doesn't end here. Get ready for an extraordinary time management activity this Saturday! It promises to be a valuable experience you won't want to miss. Mark your calendar and prepare to unlock new skills for a more organized and productive future.
Your proud mentor,

Ms. Saloni

04/10/23, 12:24 - Saloni Rastogi: Dear Students,

As we approach the upcoming exam period, it is crucial to ensure that you are well-prepared not only academically but also in terms of time management and maintaining effective communication with your mentors. To facilitate this process, we kindly request all students to submit their time management strategies and plans for maintaining constant communication with mentors during the exam period.
Your submitted strategies will not only help you stay on track during the exam period but also enable your mentors to provide you with the support and guidance you need.
We appreciate your proactive approach to effective time management and mentor communication during this crucial time. Your success is our priority, and we are here to support you every step of the way.

Best regards,
TEAM EWYL

04/10/23, 15:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofians,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning

05/10/23, 16:43 - Fidelis EWYL22E0558: As I stated earlier on that I switched phones so first let me recreate it and am planning to add other students by going to some youth centers and telling them about this I did this yesterday but you know its really hard to gain peoples trust.most of my friends are not interested due to strict parents but am trying ma'am
05/10/23, 16:45 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, at times it can be hard but I am sure you can do that. Let me share some things that will surely be able to help you make them understand things better.

05/10/23, 16:54 - Fidelis EWYL22E0558: Thanks
05/10/23, 16:56 - Saloni Rastogi: So for community building:
1) Keep the group updated DAILY.
2) Try reaching out to students from different schools
3) Try reaching out to teachers from your school or others and ask them to share the link to your WhatsApp group with other school teachers from different schools
4) In the group just:
-please give 'only admins' access
-just ask the students/participants to DM you to know about Edoofa and to get the form
-once they DM you, share about Edoofa with them
-Before sharing the form, ask them to get you added to their school groups
-once they do that, then only share the form with them.‚Äã
‚Äã5) Use social media as your sword to tell people about Edoofa
6) Use Facebook groups, I am sharing a screenshot that will help you understand that there are various groups on Facebook that you can join and share information about Edoofa also forward the link to your WhatsApp group there.
05/10/23, 16:56 - Saloni Rastogi: .
05/10/23, 16:56 - Saloni Rastogi: .
05/10/23, 16:56 - Saloni Rastogi: .
05/10/23, 16:58 - Fidelis EWYL22E0558: Okay am going to do this ma'am
05/10/23, 16:58 - Saloni Rastogi: There is a trick on how you can excel and increase the number of participants in the group:

1. Give only admin access in the group and share messages in the group that can direct them towards your inbox where you can share the information about Edoofa.
Similar to the screenshot that I am sharing with you.
05/10/23, 16:58 - Saloni Rastogi: .
05/10/23, 16:58 - Saloni Rastogi: 2. Once they come to your INBOX, share information about Edoofa with them except for the application form.

3. Afterwards, if they ask for the application form, ask them to share the link of your WhatsApp group with 10 other groups and them share a screenshot with you once they have done that.

4. After they have done it, share the application form with them.
05/10/23, 17:00 - Fidelis EWYL22E0558: Wow it kinda seems easier now
05/10/23, 17:27 - Saloni Rastogi: That is great, now we need to start working and keep sharing the updates with me on regular basis.
05/10/23, 17:27 - Fidelis EWYL22E0558: Okay maam

We've all heard experts advise us to concentrate, eliminate distractions, and commit to mastering one thing. This guidance is undoubtedly valuable, and the more I study successful individuals from various fields‚Äîbe it artists, athletes, entrepreneurs, or scientists‚Äîthe more I am convinced that focus plays a pivotal role in their accomplishments.

Together, we'll explore strategies and ideas that can help you navigate the complex landscape of choices and find your true calling.
Read the PDF very carefully and we will connect in our upcoming session.

Till Then
