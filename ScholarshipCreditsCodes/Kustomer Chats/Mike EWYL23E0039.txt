We hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. As you all know, the Edoofa program has been an incredible journey for each one of you, providing valuable opportunities and experiences to shape your future. We believe that your voices and stories deserve to be heard by both your school heads and your fellow schoolmates.
We are excited to announce a special Saturday Activity where we invite you to create two videosâ€”one addressed to your school heads and another for your schoolmates. In these videos, we encourage you to share your personal experiences with the Edoofa program and how it has positively impacted your life.
We also want you to apply all that you have learned in our recent Wednesday lessons on being a student leader. Use this opportunity to showcase your growth and development, and inspire others with your leadership skills.
In your videos, feel free to share anecdotes, challenges you overcame, and achievements you've accomplished through the Edoofa program. Share how it has helped you gain new perspectives, enhance your academic skills, and broaden your horizons. Let your enthusiasm and gratitude shine through as you express your thoughts and emotions about this wonderful journey.
Remember, your videos have the power to inspire and motivate others who may be considering joining the Edoofa program. By sharing your authentic experiences, you can help them make informed decision and embark on a transformative educational journey.
Once you have created your videos, please submit them to your EWYL Mentors

Best regards,
