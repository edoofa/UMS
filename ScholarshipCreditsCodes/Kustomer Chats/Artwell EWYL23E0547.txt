How are you?
09/10/23, 13:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Before we begin, as you have come on the EWYL Line, you have already completed some basic formalities. Now, I would like to talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.

I kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let me know.
09/10/23, 15:56 - Artwell EWYL23E0547: Student is at school. I am currently at work
09/10/23, 16:45 - Saloni Rastogi: Then we will keep the program on hold, don't worry.
09/10/23, 18:00 - Artwell EWYL23E0547: Thank you
