Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

29/07/22, 01:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Petronela!
How's your day going?
29/07/22, 01:04 - Saloni Rastogi: I am so glad to receive such responses from you on the community building as well as the African school project.
29/07/22, 01:04 - Saloni Rastogi: The school details that you have shared have already partnered with Edoofa.
29/07/22, 01:05 - Saloni Rastogi: Your response to the Wednesday wisdom has made me realize our childhood quote  is Money'.
Through Wednesday Wisdom, my main aim was to educate my Edoofians about TIME MANAGEMENT and HOW IT CAN BE ACHIEVED.
You know are very well aware of what Time management means, let me tell you about what Time Management includes:

#Effective Planning
# Setting goals and objectives
# Setting deadlines
# Delegation of responsibilities
# Prioritizing activities as per their importance
# Spending the right time on the right activity

The benefits of Time Management are:
- Time Management makes an individual punctual and disciplined.
- One becomes more organized as a result of effective Time Management.
- Individuals who stick to a time plan are the ones who realize their goals and objectives within the shortest possible period. 
- Research says that individuals who accomplish tasks on time are less prone to stress and anxiety. 

How can we achieve it:
# Set a goal for yourself.
# Priority matrix (like we talked about in the Wednesday lesson)
# Organize your study space
# Do a SWOT Analysis of yourself.

I am sure you will note all these things and imply in your day-to-day life and do share with me what changes you have felt.

How are you?
04/08/22, 22:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Reading your response Petronela filled me with so much fire, passion, and motivation. It got reminded me of one quote:
“If you want to be happy the whole life, tie it to a goal, not people or objects.”

This was the quotation given by Alert Einstein and the quote which gives the definition of a goal.
Through this lesson, my main motive was to teach you that sacrifices are required to achieve the main target, and achievement of those important aims is necessary.
Those aims are:
1. Analysis of my strength and weaknesses – because this analysis will let me know that how to work on both to make my strength more powerful and convert my weakness into my strength.
2. To be a good person and love yourself – To get positive vibes one should work on herself\/himself because “when you see yourself clearly, with eyes full of love and acceptance, you hold space for others to meet you at your highest self “(by Karly Ryan).
3. Never regret any past decision – “Every bad decision gives you a lesson and this makes one’s vision more clear towards the achievement of its goal” as it is said by a great personality that takes responsibility and initiative for yourself stop blaming your circumstances for what you can change.
4. Always give 100% – there is a frame on my living room wall, of Swami Vivekananda that always gives me motivation the quotation written in it says “Arise, awake, and do not stop until the goal is reached”.
04/08/22, 22:46 - Petronela EWYL22E0416: I'm doing well and you
04/08/22, 22:46 - Saloni Rastogi: I would like to share something about my goals.
My goals also consist of making my parents proud of their daughter, a daughter that will give them a more comfortable life, one that is not filled with such pain. Indeed, I cannot deny that truly I am not experienced as much as some people, but at least for me, every milestone in my life is an emblem of my growth. When I can complete something new successfully or learn something from my failure instead of complaining, I think I have grown up.
04/08/22, 22:47 - Saloni Rastogi: I have not received your timetable yet Petronela that was a part of the weekend activity.

08/08/22, 16:01 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
08/08/22, 16:25 - Petronela EWYL22E0416: According to my own understandings l understood that we should always tell ourselves a positive story because the stories which we tell our selves makes us who were are.l was impressed with the three quotes which encouraged me to be strong and always work harder inorder to archieve my goal and reach the top.l was also reading about the Feynman technique which helps one to learn and understand because we don't just learn to pass but also to be able to explain to others and use it in a various of situations.when we learn we give ourselves a tool to use in the future  because the more we learn the more challenges we face.
08/08/22, 16:36 - Petronela EWYL22E0416: This is because the new things  will connect to the things l already knew.The point of learning is to understand the world and the Feynman technique helps one to turn information into knowledge that one can access.The are four steps to the Feynman learning technique based on the method he used.
Thank you

Noted with thanks
08/08/22, 22:32 - Saloni Rastogi: One can be called successful if they have achieved their desired goals. For some people, being successful means being rich. But being successful is even more than being rich. When you achieve what you want, it gives you immense pleasure, and that is incomparable with being rich. To be successful in any aspect of life, one needs to have strong dedication and work hard. 
Our WEEKEND ACTIVITY discussed the traits of a successful person.
So, in our session today, we will:
1. discuss your understanding of the weekend activity.
2. make weekly plans on achieving targets on three ongoing projects.
