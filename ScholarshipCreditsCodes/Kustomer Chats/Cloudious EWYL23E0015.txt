I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
02/05/23, 17:36 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
02/05/23, 17:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *02:00-03:30 PM*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.

05/05/23, 17:20 - Cloudious EWYL23E0015: Good afternoon ma'am?
05/05/23, 18:13 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you please share yoru views on the Wednesday lesson and share how do you want to take ahead your community building project?
06/05/23, 13:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Cloudious!
How are you?
06/05/23, 13:48 - Saloni Rastogi: I am sure that you would also agree with me that being a proud Edoofian is a personal choice and a reflection of your commitment to the values and principles that define the Edoofian community. I would wish that you could be true to that by following the daily ritual consistently on the EWYL Line without fail.
06/05/23, 13:49 - Saloni Rastogi: As asked above, can you please share your views on the lesson and project update?
06/05/23, 13:50 - Cloudious EWYL23E0015: I am fine and you ma'am?
06/05/23, 13:53 - Cloudious EWYL23E0015: Yes its true, i thought i should say so just before my session
06/05/23, 14:12 - Cloudious EWYL23E0015: The wednesday lesson was a very enlightment of true personal life. Truely if we take a look at thinking itself, if you can think better than others, you will come up with fewer problems and more free time. The opposite, if you cant think better, you will find that most of your time you spent trying to fix your mistakes. Good decision makes future easier.
06/05/23, 14:21 - Cloudious EWYL23E0015: In addition,truely multitasking is not only thinking, but it impairs ability to think. Also thinking is the concentration on one thing long enough to develop an idea about it. Thinking for your self is very crucial and a person need to give brain a chance to make associations. Even that idea dosent turn out to be good and accurate. You need to think of it and correct.
06/05/23, 14:35 - Cloudious EWYL23E0015: On my project, i was waiting for the opening of schools, so that i will smoothly carry on with my project.

06/05/23, 17:11 - Cloudious EWYL23E0015: Good afternoom ma'am
08/05/23, 02:10 - Cloudious EWYL23E0015: To commence, Decision is a choice or judgement that you make after thinking and talking about what is best for you. We must be carefull in decision making because either you do the good one or the bad one. A good decision is an acceptable standard of choice that one can make after thinking and talking about it.
08/05/23, 02:12 - Cloudious EWYL23E0015: Thinking can lead to good decisioning. If you give your mind a room or space to think before making decision, you will come up with what we call good decision. Two years ago when i finished my 'O' level, my parents gave me the authority to decide my way forward. So i had two options (1) to do teaching at college (2) to proceed with schooling up to Advanced level. The best thing i did is to settle down and involved my mind into deep thinking. To tell you Ma'am i am so happy today, being a proud EDOOFIAN and i do believe its because of my good decision making.

08/05/23, 02:51 - Cloudious EWYL23E0015: Bad decision is an unpleasant choice that one make after thinking about something. If one takes a situation randomly it will lead to bad decisioning. For example from form one to three, i was a boarder at a boarding school, so when i was now in form four, i decided to get back home to carryout extra lessons as a day scholar with teachers of different schools. After a week when i was at home my father was expelled from his job and i could no longer have money to proceed with my extra lessons. At home family chores and duties started to multiply as well. Only few time to read books and to do school work. I regreted boarding life always and i do believe this made me to get low passes at 'O'level.
08/05/23, 02:51 - Cloudious EWYL23E0015: Sorry ma'am i think for the coming two days i wont be available, i will be attending my cousin sister's wedding ceremony
08/05/23, 16:54 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Cloudious!
How are you?
08/05/23, 16:55 - Saloni Rastogi: No worries, I am glad that you informed me. Please enjoy your festivity and yes, I would want to see the pictures of the ceremony🤩
08/05/23, 16:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Thank you for sharing your thoughts on decision-making. Good decisions come from careful consideration and thinking. I'm glad your thoughtful decision led you to be a proud EDOOFIAN. On the other hand, your experience of leaving boarding school for extra lessons taught you the consequences of a hasty decision. Learning from both good and bad decisions is important for our growth.

How was your weekend?
I am sure you must be working on the weekend activity and would have started working on the completion of weekly targets.
Personally speaking as your mentor, you have not performed that well on your project and it makes me so disheartened. I will try my level best to motivate you and pump you up but I am sure you realize that through these scholarship credits, you will be able to share the loads with your parents and will be able to self-finance your studies. Who doesn't want to do that?
I am sure you realize how crucial it is at this point in time.

So when I get this experience, I will be on a better position than others in my community, hence they will seek ideas and advises from me, therefore being their first preference and leader.
22/05/23, 01:27 - Cloudious EWYL23E0015: In addition to this, to be a leader in the Edoofa student community, i should be well disciplined and work towards being a sarvant leader. To do all these,  i would practice leadership skills like listening, healing, awareness, foresight etc. Firstly, i should be able to listen to People's ideas, opinion and give them chance to speak. Then think according to their ideas and opinions, are they important or not. Also need to be awareness, interms of my emotions. Are they affect people positively or negatively, then if it's negative i have to adjust.
