05/06/23, 13:53 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0213: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am Takudzwa  Dumbu and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is  Takudzwa EWYL23E0213
05/06/23, 13:53 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0213: I am a proud Edoofian!
05/06/23, 13:53 - Ananya:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, Let me share a small story with you!
 Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came. 
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.
The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell: 

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. 
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above  
05/06/23, 13:57 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0213: Indeed it's a good story to note in my diary
05/06/23, 14:23 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.
Our sessions are on TUESDAY and FRIDAY- 12:00 PM to 1:30 PM
05/06/23, 14:25 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0213: Alright noted

06/06/23, 16:06 - Ananya: First and foremost, I want you to understand that connecting with companies is not just about earning credits for your education. It goes beyond that and is crucial for your personal development.

06/06/23, 16:11 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0213: Understood
06/06/23, 16:11 - Ananya: Today we're going to talk about how to find student-centric SMEs in Africa using Google and LinkedIn. Are you familiar with these tools?
06/06/23, 16:13 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0213: Yes l am
06/06/23, 16:23 - Ananya: Great,Let's start with Google. When you're searching for student-centric SMEs in Africa, what keywords do you think you should use?
06/06/23, 16:27 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0213: Recent funded start ups
06/06/23, 16:30 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0213: And also young entrepreneurs from....giving name of my country
06/06/23, 16:36 - Ananya: That's a good start. You could also try "student-centered SMEs in Africa" or "African startups focused on education". Once you have a list of relevant startups, the next step is to find the company officials on LinkedIn. Have you used LinkedIn before?
06/06/23, 16:38 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0213: No l haven't
06/06/23, 16:39 - Ananya: That's okay. LinkedIn is a professional networking platform where you can connect with people in your industry. First, you'll need to create a profile if you haven't already. Then, you can search for the company you're interested in by typing the name of the company into the search bar.

09/06/23, 15:56 - Ananya: Alright, so which one was your favorite?
09/06/23, 15:59 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0213: "Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful".
Albert Schweitzer
09/06/23, 16:01 - Ananya: I completely agree with you! Success alone does not guarantee happiness. Instead, it is happiness that often leads to success. When you genuinely love what you are doing, it brings fulfillment and joy, which in turn fuels your motivation and determination to achieve success.
09/06/23, 16:02 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0213: Yes, indeed
09/06/23, 16:02 - Ananya: Also, were you able to read your Wednesday lesson?

09/06/23, 16:19 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0213: I understood, quite alot of things that are  essential to acquire quality skills and knowledge to our lives as a whole to be wonderful professional workers tomorrow. The lesson referred  to books, for instance the "Start up for you", not mentioning all. This book gave me an insights in how to develop a mindset of being a entrepreneur and together with some key topics in how to improve my entrepreneurship mindset
09/06/23, 16:20 - Ananya: Absolutely! Continuous learning and personal growth are essential components of becoming a wonderful professional. By exploring these resources and incorporating their teachings into your life, you'll be well-equipped to tackle the challenges and opportunities that come your way.
09/06/23, 16:21 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0213: Yes indeed
09/06/23, 16:23 - Ananya: So, Takudzwa I have a favorite part of the Wednesday lesson: Pivot Strategically: The ability to pivot and adapt to new circumstances is crucial in an ever-changing world. The authors explain how to recognize when it's time to make a career pivot and provide insights into managing transitions effectively. They emphasize the importance of maintaining a growth mindset and being proactive in shaping your own future.
09/06/23, 16:24 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0213: Well noted
09/06/23, 16:27 - Ananya: I want to highlight the importance of this because as you prepare to leave your home and embark on your new journey in India, you may encounter various challenges. However, it is essential to adapt to these new circumstances in order to foster personal growth. Embracing change and being open to new experiences will not only help you navigate the challenges but also provide opportunities for growth and development. Therefore, it's crucial to be adaptable and embrace the changes that come your way as you embark on this new chapter of your life in India.

09/06/23, 16:52 - Ananya: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about

Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
09/06/23, 16:52 - Ananya: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe.
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

09/06/23, 16:55 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0213: Thank you  ,and well noted

You know, Yesterday, something amazing happened at our workplace—we created a reel, and it was an absolute blast! It was our very first reel together in the office.
https://www.instagram.com/p/CtPOMh0pgPs/
09/06/23, 17:02 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0213: Alright thank you have a great day
10/06/23, 13:00 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week’s Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better—together. It’s why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger—as successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!
