17/07/23, 14:13 - Jasmine Kaur: Now, I want you to quickly answer these questions.

1. What are you currently doing in Community Building?
2. What are you currently doing in African School Education Reform Mission?
3. Discuss the Challenges that you are facing in Community Building.
4. Discuss the Challenges that you are facing in African School Education Reform Mission.
17/07/23, 14:25 - Jasmine Kaur: Are you facing any challenge to reply?
17/07/23, 16:55 - Fadzai EWYL23E0096: 1. I'm trying to persuade my former school mates individually, if I find those who show willingness then I will create a group for them.

2. On this one, I'm trying to reach out to Headmasters in my region but unfortunately I haven't found any replies yet

3. In community building I think the problem is that  students here in Zimbabwe are too much afraid of Satanism so they think I'm trying to get them involved in satanic activities through bribery of a scholarship. Also, parents here in my community are afraid of losing their children, they think their children might get killed if they go and study abroad.

4. On this one, the challenge is that the Headmasters and Principals that I have contacted so far haven't replied to me positively, others say they are digesting the program they will get back to me soon so I'm waiting for their reply
17/07/23, 16:58 - Fadzai EWYL23E0096: I'm sorry Ms Jasmine my network was not stable

19/07/23, 00:54 - Fadzai EWYL23E0096: Saturday Activity 

I carried out a research on the most famous business man in my community Dr Alfred Mkosi. He came from a Middle class family in Chiundura rural areas where he struggled to go to school because of financial instability. He worked very hard to produce good academic results so as to change his family background and the community at large. Dr Mkosi managed to to pass his A level and he got a chance to be enrolled at the university of Zimbabwe where he was doing medicine. After he finished his degree he then started working at Harare Hospital. After 5 years that's where he started a farming project in his community. Dr Mkosi is the most famous business man who cultivate all cash crops in Zimbabwe and also he practices cattle ranching.  

This is a result of Mr Mkosi's commitment, dedication and hardworking towards achieving his goals of raising the living standards of his family and the community by creating employment for the citizens in Chiundura rural areas. We can learn to be hard working individuals in order to achieve certain goals in our lives as Dr A Mkosi did.

20/07/23, 13:08 - Jasmine Kaur: This is really sweet Fadzai. Well Done
20/07/23, 13:08 - Jasmine Kaur: I want you to quickly answer these questions in detail.

20/07/23, 13:16 - Fadzai EWYL23E0096: 1. In community building I'm trying to persuade my friends and former school mates individually, if I find those who show willingness I will then create a group for them and share the forms with them.

2. On this one, I'm waiting for the Principals and Headmasters who promised to get back to me when they have comprehended the program. I'm also trying to reach out to other principals but to no avail

3. In community building the most challenge that I'm facing is that the parents of these students are afraid of losing their children, they think when their children go and study abroad they might get involved in Satanism or other satanic activities, the students are willing to join the Edoofa Scholarship program but their parents are denying them to do so.

4. The most challenge on this one is that the Headmasters seems to be busy, they rarely reply to me others just say we will get back to you when we are free but I haven't see someone who get back to  me.
20/07/23, 13:22 - Jasmine Kaur: Fadzai, I will be discussing the challenges. 
3. Dear you need to look for students, who are willing to go and study abroad. If you will find the right students then this will eliminate your challenge
20/07/23, 13:23 - Fadzai EWYL23E0096: Ok
