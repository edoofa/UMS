Last week we learnt about first 6 principles from the book- Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. Today’s Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the remaining principles. Ready to learn in detail?

The book outlines specific principles and strategies that successful people have used to achieve their goals. By following these principles, readers can create a roadmap for their own success. I believe, reading "Think and Grow Rich" can provide readers with the mindset, motivation, and strategies needed to achieve success in any area of life. Let us discuss in detail about your learnings in our upcoming scheduled session. 

Happy Learning

04/07/23, 13:07 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!

This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off

16/08/22, 06:28 - Tatire EWYL21E0942: Greetings sir 
So basically l learnt a few important aspects which help an individual on their day to day basis. Of course everyone aims for success but there's no sweet without sweat eventually you have to work for a good life. The theory of \"forget luck, live by intent\" shows that a person should not live in fear and anxiety for them to be able to live out of the vacuum and aim for their goals. Also in the \" stop fixating on failure\" theory brings out the aspect of hope is our only wing. There is no room for failure but there's room for lessons. When one Falls is not the matter but the matter is now when one rice is from the fall. The third theory of inspiration where one is motivated and inspired to become like someone else. Hence the lesson inspired me to put away all the negative thoughts and remain focused with the main goal of achieving success. And the importance of failures for one to finally get to learn all aspects in life that your failures does not determine you rather they make you stronger which is very effective for one to be successful.
