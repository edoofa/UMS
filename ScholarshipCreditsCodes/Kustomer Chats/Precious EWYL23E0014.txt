24/04/23, 18:38 - Precious EWYL23E0014: Greetings Ms Saloni, l am Precious Nebvuma and l am here to resume my EWYL discussion.My EWYL group name is Precious EWYL 23E0014.
24/04/23, 18:39 - Precious EWYL23E0014: I am a proud Edoofian
24/04/23, 18:39 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian, ready for a motivational monday?

In a remote village, there lives a hardworking farmer who owns a farm. Over the years his grapery yields rich crops, and the farmer is very successful. He has three sons, who are young and energetic but never worry about working. As the farmer grows older, he begins to worry about his sons‚Äô future.

Then he becomes very ill and feels that his death is coming soon. He calls his sons and says,

‚ÄúDear sons, I see my death approaching, but I want to share a secret before you all leave. These areas have treasure hidden inside. Dig the whole area after my death, to find it. ‚Äù

The old farmer died. The sons start digging for money without leaving any part of the field but nothing is found. In any case, digging their fields leads to healthier crops and results in higher incomes. These earnings make the sons realize what their father means.

What according to you is the moral of the story?

a. Hard work always pays off. The fruits of hard work are always sweet.
b. Be Selflessly kind
c. both a & b

05/05/23, 18:32 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, share a combined understanding with me?
05/05/23, 18:34 - Precious EWYL23E0014: I learnt that good decision makers understand the simple truth and also you can't make a good decision without good thinking and good thinking requires time .The best way to improve your ability to think is to spend large chunks of time thinking .
05/05/23, 18:34 - Precious EWYL23E0014: I am in love with this quote
05/05/23, 18:34 - Aditi Kapoor: Before we start on the school project, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?

Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.

Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
05/05/23, 18:34 - Precious EWYL23E0014: " If you are thinking without writing, you only think you are thinking."
05/05/23, 18:35 - Precious EWYL23E0014: Unfortunately when l reinstalled my Whatsapp l lost all the messages that l am supposed to share with the school heads
05/05/23, 18:36 - Precious EWYL23E0014: Q1.Masvingo Christian College...lt is connected with Edoofa. 

Q2.My school is located in Masvingo Province
05/05/23, 18:36 - Aditi Kapoor: You are correct in your understanding that good decision makers understand the importance of good thinking, and that good thinking requires time and concentration. In addition to spending large chunks of time thinking, it is also helpful to practice mindfulness and self-awareness, which can help improve focus and concentration.
05/05/23, 18:46 - Precious EWYL23E0014: I learnt that persistance is built upon the strength of will.When desire is compined with the will power, little can stop you from reaching your goals.Fear is nothing but a state of mind ...and the mind can be directed.Therefore you can control your fate by controlling your mind.l also learnt to trust myself and to get information from trusted sources.To accumulate money you must have power.Without power you can't put your plans into action .There are 3 ways of accumulating power....
1.Accumulated experience 
2.Infinite intelligence 
3.Experience and research
05/05/23, 18:50 - Precious EWYL23E0014: üìù
05/05/23, 18:53 - Aditi Kapoor: It's great to hear that you learned about the importance of persistence and willpower in achieving your goals. Fear can be a major obstacle to success, but by controlling your mind and trusting yourself, you can overcome it. Accumulating power is also an important aspect of achieving your goals, and the three ways you mentioned - accumulated experience, infinite intelligence, and experience and research - are all valuable ways to do so. Remember, with the right mindset and a commitment to personal growth, anything is possible.
05/05/23, 18:54 - Aditi Kapoor: TODAY, I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.
05/05/23, 18:55 - Aditi Kapoor: May I know if you have the other School Head‚Äôs Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead tomorrow.

There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head‚Äôs Contact.

Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head‚Äôs Contact.
05/05/23, 18:55 - Precious EWYL23E0014: I will get the contacts
