04/01/24, 13:18 - Ananya: As we kick off our session, here's a quote to fuel our motivation: 'The only way to do great work is to love what you do.' - Steve Jobs.

Let's approach our tasks with passion and commitment, aiming for excellence in everything we undertake today! üöÄ
04/01/24, 13:35 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: Alright. I'm excited
04/01/24, 13:37 - Ananya: Now, Adelaide, I believe that we should begin with something that aligns with your interests. May I ask, which one is your favorite project: the community building or the African school mission?
04/01/24, 13:38 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: African School Mission
04/01/24, 13:40 - Ananya: That's great So, for today, we will be discussing our third project! I will share a few crucial resources and tricks with you!
04/01/24, 13:40 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: Please do
04/01/24, 13:43 - Ananya: There are two ways to work on the African School Reform project:


A. *Connecting with school virtually*-
‚ñ™Ô∏è In this you would have to find the contacts of the schools through your peers, friends, neighbors, cousins, school teachers, and school heads.
‚ñ™Ô∏èThen introduce yourself to them professionally and state the purpose of connecting with them along with their available time.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share information about Edoofa that I will be providing you in order to help them understand the Program deeply and with more clarity.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share the school form with them, and if they are interested in connecting with us, then our aim should be to get the form filled.
04/01/24, 14:00 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: Ok. And option B.
04/01/24, 14:13 - Ananya: B. *Visiting schools physically*

‚ñ™Ô∏è Now by this, as it clearly says, you have to visit schools nearby and inform them about Edoofa.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Visiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏è With this, you will surely gain a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, overcome the fear of presenting yourself and your family Edoofa, spontaneously in front of anyone at any point.
04/01/24, 14:16 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: Ohhh, I think I'll work with option A
04/01/24, 14:25 - Ananya: This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success
‚ñ™Ô∏èVisiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear of presenting himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.
04/01/24, 14:25 - Ananya: .
04/01/24, 14:26 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: Oh wow.
04/01/24, 14:27 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: Thanks for the tip, so I'll try to work with option B.
04/01/24, 14:27 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: Any pointers on what to say?
04/01/24, 14:32 - Ananya: Well, sure!
04/01/24, 14:32 - Ananya: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!üéâ

Edoofa is a *social-for-profit organization* that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities‚ú®.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!
04/01/24, 14:32 - Ananya: Along with this, schools can be benefited in the following way:
1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‚ÄòA-Level‚Äô/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(PHD.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
04/01/24, 14:32 - Ananya: Now, as you wrap up today's endeavors, remember: 'Believe you can and you're halfway there.' - Theodore Roosevelt. Your efforts today are the foundation for your success tomorrow. Keep pushing forward with confidence and determination. üí™
04/01/24, 14:33 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: Thank you very much. This has been very enjoyable and engaging. Looking forward to the next session

15/01/24, 13:04 - Ananya: Good morning, Adelaide!

How are you doing today? I'm excited to share that we have beautifully decorated the walls of our office gallery! The space now reflects creativity and inspiration. I am so excited to add our photo here as well!üöÄü§ùüèΩ
15/01/24, 13:05 - Ananya: ,
15/01/24, 13:10 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: Good morning ma'am
15/01/24, 13:10 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: I am super excited
15/01/24, 13:17 - Ananya: Great! So, how was your weekend?
15/01/24, 13:18 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: Uneventful. I was just down with a flu bug
15/01/24, 13:19 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: How was yours?
15/01/24, 13:22 - Ananya: Are you feeling better now?
15/01/24, 13:22 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: Very much thank you for asking
15/01/24, 13:24 - Ananya: For today, I have planned something special! Do you know about a resume or a CV?
15/01/24, 13:30 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: Just a rough idea
15/01/24, 13:32 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: CV stands for Curriculum vitae and is a document with your qualifications, experience and references that's given to a prospective employer to assess your suitability for a  job
15/01/24, 13:33 - Ananya: Great! Do you have a cv of your own?
15/01/24, 13:42 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: I do. It's on my laptop but I'll try and send it at some point. It's nothing major
15/01/24, 13:47 - Ananya: Well, yesterday I was updating my little brother's resume and took help from this video. I thought to share this with you as well, as he is suggesting some really good things!

https://youtu.be/QnUI3sLZ4hc?si=HTbUElM6TNHZaPlN
15/01/24, 13:48 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: Alright ma'am. I'll go through it once I have a stronger internet connection
15/01/24, 13:51 - Ananya: Yes, please watch this video and create a resume by our next session. As of now, let us now discuss your EWYL project. Now moving ahead I want to discuss something significant with you. You know, seeing over 400 students in this event has motivated me to work for my students even harder. I want you to be here in India and pay your fee all by yourself. For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed with a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?
15/01/24, 13:55 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: Not at the moment, but I'll try and reach the set Target on Monday morning
15/01/24, 13:55 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: I have 1 concern
15/01/24, 13:57 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: I still haven't received any offers from universities and I'm starting to worry.
15/01/24, 14:05 - Ananya: Adelaide, don't worry! I just talked to our admissions officer, and they have mentioned that they have submitted your application to the university. Due to a large number of applications, the university is taking some time.
15/01/24, 14:06 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: Alright ma'am. If you say so. How soon can I expect something?
15/01/24, 14:09 - Ananya: Don't worry we have enough time, Adelaide! I think by the end of this month!
16/01/24, 18:27 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: I am a proud Edoofian

I hope this message finds you well. I'm excited to share a sneak peek of this Wednesday's lesson, where we will be delving into the key learnings from the timeless classic, "Think and Grow Rich" by Napoleon Hill.

In this session, we will explore the transformative principles outlined in the book that have guided countless individuals on their journey to success and prosperity. From the power of positive thinking and definiteness of purpose to the significance of collaboration and visualization, we will unravel the wealth of wisdom embedded in Hill's masterpiece.

Whether you're already familiar with the book or discovering it for the first time, this lesson promises to provide valuable insights that you can apply to your personal and professional life.

18/01/24, 13:22 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: I did
18/01/24, 13:23 - Ananya: Great! Kindly share your understanding with me. I want to know your perspective on 'Think and Grow Rich.'
18/01/24, 13:24 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: I am an avid reader and already making arrangements to read the complete book
18/01/24, 13:25 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: I mostly focused on resilience and the mastermind principle
18/01/24, 13:28 - Ananya: Haha, I am happy that you are keen to read the whole book! Have you tried searching for it online?
18/01/24, 13:29 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: Yes. I have. I'm yet to find a free copy
18/01/24, 13:42 - Ananya: Well, you know, I was traveling to the office today, and there was a lot of traffic on the way. I got enough time to understand the skills that my students should have if they wish to succeed in their future, covering the basic skills through the EWYL project. However, I was wondering if my students understand the core of the EWYL projects or not! So, tell me, do you even understand the intent behind these projects or not? If yes, what's that?
18/01/24, 13:45 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: I don't think I do
18/01/24, 13:51 - Ananya: .

18/01/24, 14:06 - Adelaide EWYL23E1006: Any tips to improve my skills in that respect
18/01/24, 14:09 - Ananya: Well, sure! The first step toward this is to connect with as many people as you can. Start addressing a group, just like you do in your community building project!
