25/07/22, 03:17 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals¬†motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending ‚Äú I am a proud Edoofian‚Äù even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:07 - Ananya: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:33 - Ananya: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"
18/05/23, 11:42 - Luyanda EWYL21E0764: Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am Luyanda Sibanda and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Luyanda EWYL21E0764
18/05/23, 18:59 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.
Our sessions are on Monday and Thursday from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM. If you miss a session, we can arrange a make-up session on Wednesday or Saturday.
18/05/23, 19:04 - Luyanda EWYL21E0764: Okay no problem
18/05/23, 19:10 - Ananya: Kindly share your Wednesday lesson understanding with me here!
18/05/23, 19:18 - Luyanda EWYL21E0764: It's all about belonging to a group of people and in this case , to the Edoofa student community. If one truly feels and is able to belong to the community,  one can be confident in themselves and thus can easily communicate effectively and may achieve certain goals. This also helps others to help you identify your strengths and weaknesses and work on them efficiently
18/05/23, 19:19 - Ananya: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the Wednesday lesson. It is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.
18/05/23, 19:34 - Luyanda EWYL21E0764: Yes , it is a pleasure and I hope to continue learning more
25/05/23, 18:22 - Luyanda EWYL21E0764: I am a proud Edoofian

25/05/23, 18:23 - Ananya: On this Africa Day, I would like to extend my heartfelt wishes to you. As students, you are the future leaders, innovators, and change-makers who will shape Africa's destiny.üåü

On this special day, let us take a moment to reflect on the achievements and progress that Africa has made, while also acknowledging the challenges that lie ahead.

15/06/23, 18:04 - Luyanda EWYL21E0764: Which one to be exact?
15/06/23, 18:09 - Ananya: Dear, on your EWYL group I asked you to drop a message on your EWYL line.
15/06/23, 18:10 - Luyanda EWYL21E0764: I thought you meant I should start immediately on the next session
15/06/23, 18:13 - Ananya: That is alright, I hope from now on you will always drop a message on the EWYL.
15/06/23, 18:14 - Luyanda EWYL21E0764: I will make sure to do so
15/06/23, 18:15 - Ananya: Great, now may I ask if you were able to read our weekly newsletter?
15/06/23, 18:35 - Luyanda EWYL21E0764: Yes I did
15/06/23, 18:39 - Ananya: Great, so would you like to brief me about that?
15/06/23, 18:44 - Luyanda EWYL21E0764: Yes
The thing about failure is that one shouldn't let it define who they are as a person. You can always learn from your mistakes and become a better person through that. Though one may fail multiple times , it shouldn't affect the vision or goal they have for themselves cause that is the only thing that makes them who they are.
The newsletter was about how big of a success the Bulawayo meet and greet was , all thanks to the whole organising team that played a crucial role in that and I as a person am very grateful and delighted to have been part of that team
15/06/23, 18:44 - Ananya: Indeed, Embracing failure as a stepping stone to success is a powerful mindset that can lead to personal growth and achievement. By learning from our mistakes and using them as opportunities for improvement, we can continually progress and make a positive impact within our community.
15/06/23, 18:45 - Ananya: Now, Luyanda, I would like to discuss the projects with you. Can you please let me know if you have attempted any of them?
15/06/23, 18:54 - Ananya: Today's session has concluded! We shall reconnect for our next session on Monday at the scheduled time. I wish you an amazing weekend. See you soon!

16/06/23, 14:22 - Ananya: Alright, I will share a list of schools with you in our next session. You can then connect with schools. Is that alright?

19/06/23, 18:55 - Luyanda EWYL21E0764: Yes
Sometimes to be innovative does not mean one has to come up with a brand new idea based off anything but better yet something already existing. In that way , one can have ideas of how they can make their projects or plans come to life and lesser chances of doing that occur
19/06/23, 18:58 - Ananya: I agree with you, Luyanda. Innovation doesn't always require coming up with completely new ideas from scratch. This approach allows us to tap into existing resources and experiences, making it more manageable and reducing the risks associated with starting from scratch.
19/06/23, 19:00 - Ananya: Our today's session is over.We shall now connect in our next session!
19/06/23, 19:25 - Luyanda EWYL21E0764: Thank you

Here are some suggestions to help you get started:
