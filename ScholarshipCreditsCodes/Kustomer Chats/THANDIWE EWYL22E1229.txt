15/05/23, 19:14 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: Greetings, Ms Ananya , Iam Thandiwe Dzikira and Iam here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is THANDIWE EWYL22E1229
18/05/23, 14:46 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: Morning maam

I have learnt that Servant leadership is a leadership philosophy in which the goal of the leader is to serve. This is different from the traditional leadership where the leader's main focus is the thriving of the organization. A servant leader shares power, puts the needs of the employees first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible. Instead of people working to serve the leader, the leader exists to serve the people.

In addition, there are ten important characteristics of servant leaders. Firstly, servant leaders are good at listening intently and understanding what the people are saying. A servant leader also shows empathy, that is the ability to understand other people's intentions and perspectives.

Healing is the next important characteristic of a servant leader. This characteristic relates to the emotional health and wholeness of people and involves supporting them both physically and mentally.

To conlude the summary, I have learnt that a servant leader has the following characteristics which are listening, empathy, healing, self-awareness, persuasion, conceptualization, foresight, stewardship, commitment to the growth of people and building community. A good servant leader must have these characteristics in order to succeed in everything he does.
18/05/23, 15:42 - Ananya: Good afternoon, Thandiwe!
18/05/23, 17:20 - Ananya: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the Wednesday lesson. It is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.
18/05/23, 17:59 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: Yes maam very true
19/05/23, 22:24 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: 
19/05/23, 22:24 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: Hie maam that is my list of companies
19/05/23, 22:57 - Ananya: Thandiwe, have you taken into account the factors outlined in the guide for researching companies before making a final decision?
19/05/23, 22:58 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: Yes I did maam . I hope i did not do the wrong thing
19/05/23, 22:59 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: I searched for small scale enterprises that have their main focus on students
19/05/23, 23:01 - Ananya: I understand that, now remember you have to make sure that these companies follow these factors: 

1. Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies.
2. The company can be African or Indian. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The target audience of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should not belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions,Â etc.â€‹
19/05/23, 23:11 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: I also noted this maam but i can restart if its ok with you
19/05/23, 23:13 - Ananya: Yes, dear! No issues, we shall discuss this in our next session. Is that alright?
19/05/23, 23:14 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: Its alright maam
23/05/23, 21:51 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: Hie maam im sorry for late submission . There has been a power problem and my phone has been off .
23/05/23, 22:02 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: From the Wednesday  newsletter, I learnt that inorder to change your life, you should change something you do daily. The secret to one's success is in one's daily routine. 
The newsletter also taught us about the Edoofa-grant:Empowering Edoofians. This grant is said to ensure that all deserving students like myself, have the chance to achieve their dreams and become disciplined and competent individuals. This grant helps to remove the things that hinders students from pursuing their success which are financial constraints by ensuring that Edoofians are provided with the necessary support to pursue their academic ambitions. 

Lastly, I would like to answer the two questions in the newsletter. When faced with a difficult situation, I would best control anxiety by breathing slowly. This helps one to calm down and think properly without panicking. Also, I can try distracting myself from the situation which helps to clear the mind. To conclude the summary, people with anxiety also need to be helped. We can begin by helping a person suffering from anxiety by encouraging them to keep being physically active. This helps to prevent them from panicking. People with anxiety should also get enough sleep, they should make sleep their top priority.
24/05/23, 01:21 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: Leadership is the ability of an individual or a group of people to influence and guide followers or a member of an organization, society or team.  

With the EWYL programme, I will be able to master skills of planning, co-ordination and execution. I plan to begin with the community building project which will help a lot of students to be exposed to scholarship opportunities and be part of the Edoofa family. As I will be helping the students to be exposed to such opportunities the skill of co-ordination will be brought to light.

Secondly, the African schools reform project will help to outbring execution as an important characteristic of a leader. It will be a good opportunity for schools to connect with the Edoofa and in my part of getting schools to connect with Edoofa, I will be portraying execution as an important characteristic.

Lastly, I will focus on the co-operate alliance project. This will be a unity of the business world and Edoofa in presenting Edoofians with enriching opportunities of internships and work.

To sum up, I will ensure that my name is on the next list of student leaders by being hard-working, dedicated and focused on all my projects.
24/05/23, 18:13 - Ananya: Thank you for sharing your activity. It is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.
24/05/23, 21:02 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: Very true maam
25/05/23, 15:35 - Ananya: A lovely good morning to my Proud Edoofian! 

On this Africa Day, I would like to extend my heartfelt wishes to you. As students, you are the future leaders, innovators, and change-makers who will shape Africa's destiny.ðŸŒŸ

On this special day, let us take a moment to reflect on the achievements and progress that Africa has made, while also acknowledging the challenges that lie ahead. Africa is a land of incredible beauty, resilience, and untapped potential. As students, you have the power to unlock that potential and make a positive impact on your communities, your countries, and the entire continent.âœ¨
25/05/23, 15:41 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: Goodmorning maam
25/05/23, 15:41 - Ananya: Good morning, dear!
25/05/23, 15:42 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: How are you feeling now maam
25/05/23, 15:43 - Ananya: Thank you for asking, I am doing much better now.
25/05/23, 15:43 - Ananya: So,  what are your plans for celebrating Africa day today?
25/05/23, 15:47 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: We are watching African activities, cooking African meals and dress like  true Africans maam
25/05/23, 15:50 - Ananya: Wow, that's wonderful. Why don't you share some photos with me?
25/05/23, 15:52 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: Ok maam i will share photos when we are done cooking and dressing up
25/05/23, 15:54 - Ananya: Great. So, were you able to read the Wednesday lesson?
25/05/23, 15:54 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: Yes maam i managed to read it
25/05/23, 15:56 - Ananya: That is wonderful, so would you like to share your thoughts on it?
25/05/23, 16:08 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: I found it very motivating in that when you discover your emotions,strengths and weaknesses, you  find a plan to work towards them. One also gets to plan how to do his work whilst considering the above mentioned. Just like Mr Barrack Obama did, he was able to identify his true self and be self aware, this helped him to use his strengths to deal with a lot of issues whilst he worked on his weaknesses. I was very motivated by the Wednesday lesson
25/05/23, 16:08 - Ananya: I agree with the sentiment expressed in your statement about self-awareness. Our Wednesday wisdom emphasized the importance of being honest with one's feelings and taking time for self-reflection. For instance, former President Obama dedicated 4-5 hours of his time alone after dinner, which allowed him to delve deeper into self-discovery.
25/05/23, 16:26 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: Very true maam
25/05/23, 16:30 - Ananya: May I know if you were able to search for the companies?
25/05/23, 16:43 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: Yes maam but the same companies kept on appearing i dont know if im not searching the right way
25/05/23, 16:43 - Ananya: You can try Small Scale Startup near me
25/05/23, 16:50 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: Ok maam i will try that
25/05/23, 16:54 - Ananya: Yes, try searching for that and let me know
25/05/23, 16:56 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: Ok maam
25/05/23, 17:05 - Ananya: Our session for today has come to an end. Your enthusiasm and curiosity have been truly motivating, and I am confident that you will bring the same level of energy and passion to our upcoming session on Saturday and I am excited to announce that it is going to be a video session. I will share the link with you shortly.

""Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it."" ~ Bruce Lee

In this week's Wednesday lesson, you learned about the different sorts of personalities a person carries, but only a true leader is one who understands their personality and can do wonders with its power. In today's activity, I want you to dig deeper into your own consciousness and learn more about the kind of personality you are. As I believe, the more you know yourself, the clearer your vision of the world and your mind gets. Below is a link to a personality test, which you shall be taking up this week, and then would be sharing the results via a screenshot to your mentors by Monday. You can then read and understand more about your results by discussing them with your Mentor.

Link to the Test: -

This particular exercise is going to give you an insight into the kind of person you are so that you can use your strengths to yield the maximum benefits in whatever work you take up.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own personality while performing this activity.

29/05/23, 15:53 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: It was an amazing experience maam. We were asked to talk to you about the grants form also maam
29/05/23, 15:58 - Ananya: Great, Thandiwe! You have an orange personality! Would you like to share something about this personality?
29/05/23, 16:03 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: From what i experience, it is a great personality because some of my friends actually come to me when they have problems. Even when they want to go out, they wont go out without me  because they say I uplift their spirits. Naturally I enjoy socializing with people and that has exposed me to many new things. All I can say is an Orange personality lights up the world
29/05/23, 16:04 - Ananya: Indeed, Thandiwe! That is brilliant.
29/05/23, 16:07 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: I also wanted to ask if i could open a whatsapp group for the provided students maam

29/05/23, 16:23 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229: As I dug deeper into my personality, I realized that Im someone who does not want things to be done slowly.

I can also crave some alone time in a peaceful environment when i want to clear my head.
29/05/23, 16:26 - Ananya: It is commendable that you have recognized your preference for efficiency and a dislike for slow-paced activities. Additionally, your acknowledgment of occasionally being swayed by your emotions demonstrates self-awareness.
