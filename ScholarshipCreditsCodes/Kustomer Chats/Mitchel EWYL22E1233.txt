06/03/23, 22:22 - Unknown: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

17/03/23, 22:54 - Mitchel EWYL22E1233: On my own understanding . Wealth is something that is regarded as important in life  more than money or status . For us to have joy and also to have successfull lives we need to focus on wealth . After focusing on wealth, money is used as tool to give support to the wealth .Along with that there is status which is the society hierarchy when people are able to give you.
17/03/23, 23:19 - Unknown: I appreciate your perspective on the importance of wealth in our lives. Your statement highlights that wealth is a crucial factor in achieving joy and success, and that it should be prioritized over money or status. Your suggestion to focus on building wealth as a means to attain success is a wise one. Your view on money as a tool to support wealth is insightful, as it recognizes that wealth creation should be the main priority. Lastly, your acknowledgment of the role of social status in society and its influence on individuals is a valuable insight. Overall, your statement provides a well-rounded perspective on the significance of wealth, money, and status in our lives.

20/03/23, 17:42 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian!

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!","transform":"
