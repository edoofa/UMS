05/12/23, 16:29 - Saloni Rastogi: You talked about working on African School project, can you share how will you work on it?
05/12/23, 16:32 - Deborah EWYL23E0585: I will to talk to different school principals in my area sharing the news about Edoofa also encouraging then to be part of it as a school as this would help a lot
05/12/23, 16:45 - Saloni Rastogi: There are two ways to work on the African School Reform project:
05/12/23, 16:45 - Saloni Rastogi: A. *Connecting with school virtually*-

▪️ In this you would have to find the contacts of the schools through your peers, friends, neighbors, cousins, school teachers, and school heads.
▪️Then introduce yourself to them professionally and state the purpose of connecting with them along with their available time.
▪️ Then share information about Edoofa that I will be providing you in order to help them understand the Program deeply and with more clarity.
▪️ Then share the school form with them, and if they are interested in connecting with us, then our aim should be to get the form filled.
05/12/23, 16:45 - Saloni Rastogi: B. *Visiting schools physically*


▪️ Now by this, as it clearly says, you have to visit schools nearby and inform them about Edoofa.
▪️ Visiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
▪️ With this, you will surely gain a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, overcome the fear of presenting yourself and your family Edoofa, spontaneously in front of anyone at any point.
05/12/23, 16:51 - Deborah EWYL23E0585: Ok
05/12/23, 16:52 - Deborah EWYL23E0585: That  is great.  I will try my best in all this
05/12/23, 16:59 - Saloni Rastogi: I am sure by today you will be able to arrange 2-3 contacts and share the same with me.
05/12/23, 17:01 - Deborah EWYL23E0585: Ok l will share them but not now l only have 1 but by the end of the day it will be ready
05/12/23, 17:01 - Saloni Rastogi: That is alright!
05/12/23, 17:02 - Saloni Rastogi: We're wrapping up today's session, and I'm thrilled about what's coming up tomorrow. I can't wait for our daily ritual to continue, and I'm confident you'll be right on track to dive into Wednesday's lesson with enthusiasm.

09/12/23, 18:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

I kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let me know.
