25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years. The price is knowing that time is working on your side even when the results don’t show it.

Happy New week edoofian! How was your weekend?
11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

Did you work on that ?
16/08/22, 20:14 - Arnold EWYL21E0433: Nooo not yet
16/08/22, 21:09 - Unknown: I see, why is that? Are you facing any challenges with that?

You must have tried to incorporate the three success mantras you learned about in our Wednesday lesson into your daily activities. Now, the majority of successful people also adhere to a select few other success mantras. I want you to share with me the success mantra that best suits your personality and that you have already mastered as part of this week's assignment.

17/08/22, 01:26 - Arnold EWYL21E0433: As for me l will use [#2 Stop Fixating on Failure] because , indeed 
For a committed man, there is no such thing as failure. If you fall down 100 times in the day, it is 100 lessons learnt. Moreover am not afraid of being a failer because everyone fails , its gone happen to you , me or everyone but instead of sitting on my hand l will find courage inside me and say “ alright that was a mistake so what can l do differently “ because what we do after failer is what defines us .so will be committed in myself so that my dreams can come true
17/08/22, 02:05 - Unknown: Really interesting work on the weekend activity Edoofian, I am sure you must be able to see a pattern on how what you have learnt and aim to learn is in line with the personality you admire as the aim is create impact on others and become successful at what you do. Right?

12/11/22, 00:10 - Unknown: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian,

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.
