07/10/22, 20:19 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings my proud edoofian,
There was an important festival day before yesterday named Dussehra

Dussehra marks the end of navratri celebrations. The nine day long Hindu festival of worshiping the feminine energy Shakti comes to an end with Dussehra. This year, Dussehra will be celebrated in India on October 5.
Also known as Vijaya Dashami, this day signifies the victory of good over evil.
07/10/22, 20:20 - Jasmine Kaur: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

08/10/22, 20:41 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!

13/10/22, 21:18 - Jasmine Kaur: Edoofian , we have a new blooming opportunity for the bright students.

Since you are supposed to come in 2023 you have enough time to devote to the project.

Hence, I would like to inform you that we have one of the most *challenging as well as easy* project coming up : SOCIAL MEDIA

It is a 20 day long project and the credits earned will be *$28*

Also, though social media posting and engagement is easy but it demands *regular attendance and hardwork*. You will have to devote at least 30 minutes of your day.

Please agree to the opportunity only if you are ready to be regular and work hard for the project. If you have any excuse please inform me now so that I can give the opportunity to some other student.
13/10/22, 21:29 - Doreen EWYL22E0381: Yes I'm ready for the project
13/10/22, 21:53 - Jasmine Kaur: Are you sure Doreen?
