19/01/24, 16:09 - Diolyne EWYL23E1108: "Think and Grow Rich" is a book by Napoleon Hill that outlines his formula for success. The book is based on the principle that thoughts become things and that what we think about, we bring about. Hill argues that if you have a clear goal and a burning desire to achieve it, you can make it happen by using the right combination of persistence, planning, and action. He outlines thirteen principles for achieving success, including having a clear goal, believing in yourself, and being willing to learn from failure. He also emphasizes the importance of positive thinking and taking action on your goals.
