12/07/22, 16:50 - Persistance EWYL21E0574: *Weekend Task* 

Learning can be perceived from anywhere. We live in this digital era that is continuously evolving. So to keep up with that, here I've listed few skills or practices that a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits. I believe these skills are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring in a lot of learning.

1. Observational Skills

To have good observational skills means being aware of your surroundings, gathering information, and applying it when necessary. Observation helps us learn things from reality. By being observant, our brain is continuously trying to absorb and analyze information. It affects our thought process and enables us to read our environment while passively observing.

2. Critical Thinking Skills

At every stage of life, we have to make decisions. Be it choosing our favourite flavour of lollypop as a kid or your major in school as a student, critical thinking helps us make more precise and calculated decisions. Furthermore, they help us indulge in logical reasoning and build problem-solving skills. As Edoofians, we need critical thinking skills to make decisions throughout our academic life that will eventually shape your future in the professional field of work. It also helps us develop intellectually and enhances our creativity.

3. Research Skills

The goal of developing research skills should not be limited to achieving good grades in our academic projects. Research helps us stay curious, exposed to new knowledge from time to time, helps us find answers to varied questions or hypotheses, and stay updated. Research can be on general topics or on a particular field of knowledge. Developing high research skills will help us find answers to all our questions and learn about people and their cultures. This skill further helps us acquire another set of skills as we are continuously exploring various projects

13/07/22, 06:07 - Persistance EWYL21E0574: What are the best coding bootcamps?

Best coding bootcamps combine instructor-led sessions, independent study, practice assignments, and group projects. These programs provide opportunities to use industry-standard software and technologies. This ensures that students develop strong theoretical foundations and applied knowledge.The best coding bootcamps offer learning flexibility, high returns on investment, and extensive student support services. Just like Skooqs aims to develop participants' skills in topics such as web development, software design, mobile app development, information technology security, and data science. They typically attract technology professionals looking to strengthen their already existing skill set, and career switchers who want to gain new coding skills. Bootcamps often support participants in finding a job as a programmer, and some coding bootcamps even partner with companies to give graduates job placement opportunities.
13/07/22, 06:08 - Persistance EWYL21E0574: What are the main qualities for a UX designer

User Experience designers are jacks of all trades — and masters of everything. They have become nearly as critical to projects as the software developers themselves. No, they don’t actually build the product from the ground up, but they do make it appealing to prospective and current users. They’re responsible for the look and feel of your software, making it more attractive in all senses.

1. An Ability to Explain Complex Concepts in a Digestible Format

On a development team, everyone has roles, and they are often highly technical. One way to separate the good professionals from the great ones is by assessing their ability to translate their work into layman’s terms. 

Empathy
A UX designer needs to have empathy in order to understand the user. It’s a difficult quality to measure or assess, but it’s a crucial one nonetheless. 

Knowledge of Tools
UX designers, of course, must be equipped with knowledge of a wide array of tools and software in order to do their jobs successfully.

Ability to Collaborate
UX designers are an integral part of the development team, but they are just that part of the team. They must be able to collaborate with the other members of team, including the developers, the project manager, the QA testers, the project lead, and any other key players. 
13/07/22, 06:09 - Persistance EWYL21E0574: what is a digital marketing boot camp?

A digital marketing bootcamp is similar to a mini-school where one may learn about digital marketing. Various classes are condensed into a crash course of content and delivered to students during a certain period of time, usually a few weeks or days.
we can investigate the digital marketing environment and gain understanding of marketing essentials such as campaign building and user acquisition, as well as improve campaign analysis abilities.
13/07/22, 06:10 - Persistance EWYL21E0574: What is the best way to learn graphic design? What are some good sources on the web?

Graphic Design is one of the most demanding and trending courses at the current time and if one  has an interest in design and are a kind of creative person then I suggest they should go for graphic designing.
One should learn the basic principles of it from which he\/she will understand it more nicely and will help to give a solid start in it.
There are quite some tools to make an attractive and wonderful design so by learning the use of these tools, one can make the best design more easily.
One should also learn from professionals and practice more and more
13/07/22, 06:10 - Persistance EWYL21E0574: What is the use of digital marketing bootcamps?

Digital marketing is the real business in our time. It's a way of making profits. With digital marketing you can take advantage of every customer that comes to your site, no matter how tough that customer is to reach.

Basically, digital marketing is all about reaching the customer wherever he or she is at, regardless of age or social status.

Analytics and reporting

Digital selling strategy
Email selling
Computer program selling

15/07/22, 17:29 - Persistance EWYL21E0574: Okay
15/07/22, 18:35 - Unknown: I am also fine, Persistance.
Thanks for asking
15/07/22, 18:52 - Persistance EWYL21E0574: 1. Is Adobe After Effects easy to learn?

I would say its fun to learn in small bits and implement it, by doing that the excitement of learning something new goes up. When you notice that fancy things which you were seeing in various media are really happening on your computer and you doing it, the hunger for learning more, increases.

When you keep learning and experimenting with an dedicated amount of time everyday, within 6–8 months you will be champ.

Another tip, keep an eye for new works by following some experts especially from Skooqs, that will boost your creativity and room for inspiration.
15/07/22, 18:53 - Persistance EWYL21E0574: 2. What are digital skills in the IT industry?

Digital skills are crucial for businesses across industries that want to raise brand awareness, offer great social customer service, generate leads, and increase revenue. 
Skooqs’ definition of digital skills is ‘a range of abilities to use digital devices, communication applications, and networks to access and manage information. They enable people to create and share digital content, communicate and collaborate, and solve problems for effective and creative self-fulfillment in life, learning, work, and social activities.’
Students that learn digital skills not only make themselves more employable but future-proof their career by understanding key digital channels. 

Digital skills have high value and add to our college applications as well as work resumes. We should try to learn as many sets of digital skills as possible. It could be learning how to use excel, building presentations, or digital marketing. Digitization has expanded tenfold in the past decade, and it will continue to. Hence, we must adapt to it and keep learning digital skills like online searching, emailing, programming, etc.
15/07/22, 18:53 - Persistance EWYL21E0574: 3. What are some of the best websites to learn Adobe After Effects?

I would say YOUTUBE is a big source of learning. We have other paid and unpaid tutorials and courses through various CG sites. But if we want to learn it for a career purpose always better to learn it from Skooqs. I know that institutes wont teach us much advanced just like YouTube or Skooqs ones but an experienced person sitting beside you and teaching have a lot of affect on your work. Learning a software is easy with Skooqs. Learning techniques and shortcuts file management these things tutorials wont teach us correctly as of a proffesional person. There is always something called work culture pipelines and even render optimizations. If we are learning for hobby then youtube and Skooqs are enough.
15/07/22, 19:26 - Unknown: Persistance, Have you gone through training document before writing these questions?
Because I just got off from call with Skooq's team and they said that you haven't mentioned Skooqs in these answers.
15/07/22, 19:29 - Persistance EWYL21E0574: I mentioned Skooqs, Sir

Please check once again
15/07/22, 19:52 - Unknown: The team mentioned the in the last 5 answers you haven't.

There was one more task on Skooqs which I completely missed out on.
