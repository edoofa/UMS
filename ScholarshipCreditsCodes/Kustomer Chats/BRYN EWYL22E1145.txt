15/05/23, 17:34 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: I am a proud Edoofian
15/05/23, 17:34 - Ananya: `- That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!`

`- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.``- How do you intend to broaden this student community? 

In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.
15/05/23, 17:34 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: Ok
18/05/23, 16:35 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am Bryn Charuma, and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is BRYN EWYL22E1145
18/05/23, 16:36 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: We have two types of leadership, sevant and traditional leadership, where sevant leadership is when the leader takes into cognizance the views of the employees interact and build strong good relationships with employees and traditional leadership is the type of leadership where the leadership only care about profit and progress without recognizing the needs of employees.For us to be successful and achieve greatness we should take sevant leadership into practice so that we don't end lossing employers as a result of arogancy and impoper leadership  skill. As we see how the founders of Edoofa, Mr Angad Singh, and Avreen Signh, you can tell  that to be a good, it is not all about achieving power, but you have to listen to your interact with them ,empathize with employees and let them reach their full potential in their fields of work
18/05/23, 16:36 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: No power there is bad network
18/05/23, 16:38 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: 2G
18/05/23, 17:15 - Ananya: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the Wednesday lesson. It is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.
18/05/23, 17:31 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: Monday right
18/05/23, 19:16 - Ananya: Yes
20/05/23, 14:30 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: I am a proudly Edoofian
20/05/23, 14:59 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: How are you doing today
20/05/23, 15:03 - Ananya: I am doing great, thank you for asking!
20/05/23, 15:04 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: Anytime
20/05/23, 15:07 - Ananya: Moving forward, may I know if you were able to fill out the company details form?
20/05/23, 15:14 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: I am still working on my LinkedIn profile and my network so that can be able to view company details s
20/05/23, 15:15 - Ananya: I understand, however, you do not need to connect to anyone for filling out the company detail.

20/05/23, 15:25 - Ananya: Yes, dear!
20/05/23, 15:33 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: I'm mean to say I can't see more company details because of my LinkedIn network
20/05/23, 15:43 - Ananya: May I know which detail you are finding difficult to search for?
20/05/23, 15:50 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: When I search for companies on LinkedIn for information about the company, LinkedIn will deny me  access to view details because of my LinkedIn network
20/05/23, 15:59 - Ananya: So, you can definitely try building your network. Meanwhile, may I ask if you have a facebook account?
20/05/23, 16:19 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: Yeah I'd Benjamin Bryn
20/05/23, 16:21 - Ananya: Wonderful, now I have another brilliant idea. There, search for 'Zimbabwe student community' on Facebook. Numerous groups will appear, where you can share the link to the group along with a brief description of the EDOOFA scholarship program.

20/05/23, 16:30 - Ananya: You can search for other counties as well, like Ghana and Zambia. This will help you build a larger community.

25/05/23, 16:35 - Ananya: No, dear! That is alright, it was a confusion.
25/05/23, 16:36 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: Yeah, maybe, but I promise it won't happen again
25/05/23, 16:37 - Ananya: So, may I know if you were able to find the companies?
25/05/23, 16:45 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: I'm failing to connect with them

25/05/23, 16:50 - Ananya: For the companies, you do not have to connect with anyone, you just have to submit the details of the company!
25/05/23, 16:51 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: You have to follow them first to view details
25/05/23, 16:55 - Ananya: For a few maybe, but in most of the cases you do not require to connect with them. You just have to expand your network dear!
25/05/23, 16:58 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: Yeah, that is what I have to do
25/05/23, 17:00 - Ananya: You can expand your network by connecting with diversified groups, kindly do this by this week so that you can search for the companies.
25/05/23, 17:05 - Ananya: Our session for today has come to an end. Your enthusiasm and curiosity have been truly motivating, and I am confident that you will bring the same level of energy and passion to our upcoming session on Saturday and I am excited to announce that it is going to be a video session. I will share the link with you shortly.
25/05/23, 17:21 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: Thank you
29/05/23, 20:18 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: I am a proud Edoofian.Self-awareness is the ability to focus on yourself and how your actions, thoughts, or emotions do or don't align with your internal standards. It is a key to both mental health and workplace success. It directly impacts job performance, helps manage emotions, and improves decision-making. Self-awareness provides a better understanding of what you want and helps you know your weaknesses and strengths.
29/05/23, 20:18 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
29/05/23, 20:21 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: That is true
29/05/23, 20:22 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: I thought you were going to be there in Harare for the greet and meet.
01/06/23, 16:01 - BRYN EWYL22E1145: I am a proud Edoofian.
Positive minded people are individuals who help in whatever achieving anything in life, goals on your way to success to becoming successful individuals you have to work with others. You make sure you surround yourself with positive minded people so that they will motivate, cheer you up, and do a lot of personal growth. Avoid interacting with negative minded people because they are distraction towards your goals
