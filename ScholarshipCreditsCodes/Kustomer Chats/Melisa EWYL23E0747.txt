01/12/23, 05:49 - Melisa EWYL23E0747: Thank you
01/12/23, 15:08 - Melisa EWYL23E0747: Sorry ma'am for being late. Can i tell you what I understood on Wednesday. Now my network is normal
01/12/23, 15:15 - Melisa EWYL23E0747: The PDF talked about the input-output. Input is what I apply to the task or question whereas output is what I produce . Firstly when I am tasked to do something I should understand the task and break it down into small parts that I can understand myself. Secondly I should consider the inputs which is assessing the information that I would have gathered if it suits my question. Thirdly  I should craft the process whereby I will be looking for the best way or method to present my work. We move on to the output evaluation , this is whereby I will be analysing my work or produce so that I can see if I have answered the question properly. I should also analyse my work and realize my mistakes so that I can learn from them
01/12/23, 15:18 - Melisa EWYL23E0747: Being able to do the above will help me prepare myself for the challenges and opportunities that await in my future carrier and it also empowers me to approach tasks with a strategic mindset , continuously learn from my experiences and refine my skills
01/12/23, 19:55 - Aditi Kapoor: Greeting Melisa!
Hope you are well.
01/12/23, 19:55 - Aditi Kapoor: Thank you for sharing your insights on the PDF. It's great to see your understanding of the input-output process and how you apply it to your tasks. Breaking down the task, considering inputs, crafting the process, and evaluating the output are key steps, and your commitment to learning from mistakes is commendable. Your proactive approach to preparing for future challenges and opportunities is a valuable mindset that will undoubtedly contribute to your success in your future endeavors. Keep up the excellent work!
