How are you doing?

Problem-solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem-solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals toward achieving this goal.

So can you please share what are your views on:
1) Wednesday lesson
2) progress on the projects
12/01/23, 21:20 - Aditi Kapoor: I can very well relate to what you said about the 5 problem-solving strategies proposed by Charlie Munger.
I related most to the line, “Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Systematically you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. Nevertheless, you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts. Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day – if you live long enough – most people get what they deserve.”

14/01/23, 02:58 - Aditi Kapoor: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

The problem which i have encountered recently is that i wanted to go for a trip and i didn't have money to go and spent.I only had money to pay for transport, then i quickly thought of using that money to start a small business which helped me to earn more income quickly. Then i got money to pay for transport and money to spend after running my small business and i haven't figured out which problem-solving strategy is similar to this.
