With everything going virtual, the cyber security sector is facing rapid growth. The recent estimates suggest that cyber security globally will grow by over $50 billion by the end of 2022.
The online work and study from home modality means that the risks of cyber attacks will rise. People in Zimbabwe will now need to ensure data protection and digital security. For those in this sector, opportunities span beyond antivirus software to also including data backup services given the accelerated growth in the sector. Cyber security is trending on the market as many businesses and individuals have become more technologically oriented in Zimbabwe. 
The Zimbabwean government is also making plans to to invest more in cyber security in light of growing cyber crimes and increased use of digital platforms by businesses, non governmental organisations ( NGO), individuals and the government itself.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
