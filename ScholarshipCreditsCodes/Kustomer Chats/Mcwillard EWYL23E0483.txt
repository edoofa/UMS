As we embark on a new year, it's the perfect time to reflect on our aspirations and set goals for personal and academic growth. To kick off our Saturday activity, we invite you to share the goals you've set for yourself in the upcoming year, 2024.üéØ

Whether your goals are related to academics, personal development, extracurricular activities, or any other aspect of your life, we want to hear about them! This is a wonderful opportunity for us to inspire and support one another as a community.

Please take a moment to jot down your goals and be prepared to share them during our Saturday activity. It could be something as simple as improving your study habits, achieving a certain grade, learning a new skill, or even fostering better connections with your peers.‚ú®

Remember, setting goals is not only a way to envision your future but also a roadmap to success. By sharing your goals, you might inspire someone else to reach for their dreams as well.
