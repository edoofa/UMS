30/05/23, 13:21 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey.

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.
Our sessions are on Tuesday and Friday from 12:00 PM to 1:30 PM.
30/05/23, 15:33 - Danzel EWYL22E1099: I am a Proud Edoofian

09/06/23, 17:46 - Ananya: How are you today?
09/06/23, 17:47 - Danzel EWYL22E1099: Doing well and you?
09/06/23, 17:47 - Danzel EWYL22E1099: I'm well and you?
09/06/23, 17:49 - Ananya: Thank you for asking, I am doing great!
09/06/23, 17:50 - Danzel EWYL22E1099: That is wonderful
09/06/23, 17:51 - Ananya: So, may I ask if you were able to read your Wednesday lesson?
09/06/23, 17:51 - Danzel EWYL22E1099: I will once I have an Internet connection
09/06/23, 17:53 - Danzel EWYL22E1099: Yes I was able to
I will definitely look for the Start up of you
09/06/23, 18:01 - Ananya: Would you like to brief me about the same?
09/06/23, 18:15 - Danzel EWYL22E1099: Yes
So the lesson was mainly about networking and building relationships with people 
And with that said there are books that help with attaining such skills and in my lesson 'The Start Up of You' was mentioned
And some points argued by the author's were  Networking intelligence and Plan to adapt to mention a few
09/06/23, 18:18 - Ananya: Absolutely. Also, Danzel I have a favorite part of the Wednesday lesson: Pivot Strategically: The ability to pivot and adapt to new circumstances is crucial in an ever-changing world. The authors explain how to recognize when it's time to make a career pivot and provide insights into managing transitions effectively. They emphasize the importance of maintaining a growth mindset and being proactive in shaping your own future.
09/06/23, 18:23 - Danzel EWYL22E1099: Okay yeah that's a good part
09/06/23, 18:26 - Ananya: I want to highlight the importance of this because as you prepare to leave your home and embark on your new journey in India, you may encounter various challenges. However, it is essential to adapt to these new circumstances in order to foster personal growth. Embracing change and being open to new experiences will not only help you navigate the challenges but also provide opportunities for growth and development. Therefore, it's crucial to be adaptable and embrace the changes that come your way as you embark on this new chapter of your life in India.
09/06/23, 18:30 - Danzel EWYL22E1099: Yes thank you
I just hope it won't be that hard for me to adapt
09/06/23, 18:39 - Ananya: Trust me,it won't !
09/06/23, 18:40 - Danzel EWYL22E1099: Okay
09/06/23, 18:45 - Ananya: Now, would you like to share which project is your favorite?
09/06/23, 18:47 - Danzel EWYL22E1099: Oh yeah
Community building is my favorite
09/06/23, 18:49 - Ananya: Alright, I really appreciate your interest in community-building projects. However, I also want to ensure that you have a well-rounded development as promised by the EWYL journey.

To help you make the most of all the projects available, I have devised a target table that has proven to be successful for many of my students. By following this target, you can contribute your time in a smart way and earn many credits along the way.
09/06/23, 18:51 - Danzel EWYL22E1099: Okay 
Is it possible to see the table
09/06/23, 18:54 - Ananya: Absolutely, let me share the plan. Your plan for every week includes completing the following tasks:

https://www.instagram.com/p/CtPOMh0pgPs/
09/06/23, 19:06 - Danzel EWYL22E1099: Wow I take a look at that 
Thank you
10/06/23, 13:07 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week’s Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better—together. It’s why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger—as successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!
12/06/23, 10:49 - Danzel EWYL22E1099: Good morning
 Deepening my relation I don't know what can I say.
Since high school I have been known to be the antisocial guy and I don't know if I really can say there's a way I can deepen my relations with anyone.
Yes I do have friends but a few and I think I am ok with that because they drive me to achieve greater things in life they have the same drive as me when it comes to wanting a successful bright future so yeah
And in as much as I can say I'm that antisocial guy I am still learning  there's is a need to adapt to new things sometimes  so I will have to step up a connect with the friends of my friends maybe so as to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community
13/06/23, 17:54 - Danzel EWYL22E1099: I am a Proud Edoofian

23/06/23, 18:54 - Ananya: Hello Edoofian,
We hope this message finds you well in your academic pursuits. We are excited to share a Saturday activity centered around learning from influential personalities. Our chosen figure is Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of Liberia and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Through her remarkable leadership and unwavering determination, she has left an indelible mark on history. Let's draw valuable lessons from her life for our personal development.

Two traits that stand out about Ellen Johnson Sirleaf are resilience and visionary leadership. These qualities can greatly contribute to our growth and development as individuals. They can positively impact our academic pursuits, relationships, and future career goals.

To develop resilience, we can learn from Sirleaf's ability to bounce back from challenges. We can seek out difficult experiences and learn from them, cultivating a mindset of perseverance and adaptability.

Here are some suggestions to help you get started:

Identify two traits: Reflect on Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's qualities that resonate with you.

Reflect on personal development: Consider how these traits can positively impact your academic pursuits, relationships, or future career goals.

Create an action plan: Outline practical steps like seeking mentorship, practicing self-discipline, engaging in community service, or pursuing relevant courses and extracurricular activities.
Let's embark on this exciting journey together and make Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's legacy an integral part of our own lives.
Best regards,

Team Edoofa

Let us look on the Highlights of a webinar with Dr. Aarushi Kehar Malhotra on sustainable menstruation, which was held on January 18, 2023!

Here at Edoofa, we are aiming to break the gender barrier and educate everyone on understanding and normalizing women's health. Leave a comment if you are interested to join the next one.

But yet to add more people I'm sharing the link
04/07/23, 13:47 - Ananya: Great, so has any one of them filled out the form?
04/07/23, 13:48 - Danzel EWYL22E1099: No not even one
04/07/23, 13:53 - Ananya: Alright, so now let me share another trick. Search for "High schools in your county/nearby place/province" to find a list of schools.
Use Google to search for the specific school's name and locate their Facebook or Instagram page.
On their social media page, check the followers or moments section to find students studying there.
Look for the contact information of the school head or principal.
Connect with the school head while simultaneously reaching out to the students for your community building project.
04/07/23, 13:54 - Danzel EWYL22E1099: Okay thank you I will do that
04/07/23, 14:06 - Ananya: You can give me an update in our next session. Meanwhile, Here I am sharing the Newsletter for the week.
