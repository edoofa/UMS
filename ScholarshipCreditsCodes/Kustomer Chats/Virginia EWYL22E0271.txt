19/07/22, 22:07 - Unknown: Did you work on the  very interesting Weekend activity? 

I personally enjoyed learning about SWOT analysis and implementing it for my self. I hope you did too.
19/07/22, 22:13 - Virginia EWYL22E0271: no sir I didnt manage to work on it
19/07/22, 23:17 - Unknown: Why is that Virginia?
19/07/22, 23:17 - Unknown: Can you work on it now?
19/07/22, 23:17 - Unknown: Did you work on the IndianDoc project?
20/07/22, 01:41 - Virginia EWYL22E0271: yes sir i will work on it
20/07/22, 02:41 - Unknown: Good, today Virginia, I want you to reach out to the people you have shared it with and request them to fill the form.
20/07/22, 06:21 - Virginia EWYL22E0271: okay sir i will do that
20/07/22, 20:34 - Unknown: Hello Virginia! Please share the update of your progress on the Indian Doc project.
20/07/22, 20:35 - Unknown: And since you have mentioned 3 as your response Virginia, let me help you understand what it means to be a proud edoofian. For that,Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
21/07/22, 01:12 - Virginia EWYL22E0271: i dont have any progress so far
21/07/22, 02:16 - Unknown: I see Virginia, Are your relatives not filling the form and not interested in the plan?
21/07/22, 02:16 - Unknown: Or they think it is expensive?
21/07/22, 04:52 - Virginia EWYL22E0271: it is not expensive but most of them can't afford it
21/07/22, 05:13 - Virginia EWYL22E0271: it is not expensive but most of them can't afford it
21/07/22, 21:05 - Unknown: That is alright Virginia, However, you have to ask them to fill the form on the basis of their interest. If they like the program they should fill the form, you do not have to talk about the cost with them like we earlier discussed.
21/07/22, 21:05 - Unknown: Also, Did you work on the Wednesday wisdom Virginia? What are your takeaways from it?
21/07/22, 23:58 - Virginia EWYL22E0271: okay sir
22/07/22, 00:02 - Unknown: Please share your takeaways from it Virginia.
22/07/22, 00:41 - Virginia EWYL22E0271: i learnt that a successful person does not blame people for his or her failures but takes personal responsibility
22/07/22, 01:13 - Unknown: Amazing virginia, Good to read your response on this lesson Edoofian! I am glad that you were able to understand the crux of that which is that successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it
22/07/22, 01:15 - Virginia EWYL22E0271: yes thats true sir
22/07/22, 01:19 - Unknown: Do you believe you do the same thing Virginia?

25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!
