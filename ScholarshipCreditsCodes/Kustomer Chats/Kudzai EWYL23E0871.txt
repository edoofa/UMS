I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!
