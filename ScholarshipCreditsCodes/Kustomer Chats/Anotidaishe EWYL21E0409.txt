Today's Wednesday lesson is providing us with the details of how a 19year old started his journey of a successful business and today has a majority market share in Zimbabwe, handling brand portfolios worth over $870 million. After you have read the pdf carefully share your major takeaways and the inspiration you got from Gilbert Eugene Peters. 

Happy learning!
04/08/22, 20:44 - Unknown: Good afternoon Anotidaishe!
How's your day going?
04/08/22, 20:44 - Unknown: Our *Wednesday Wisdom* talked about _Gilbert Eugene Peters_, a young Zimbabwean who is the CEO and Founder of Spidex Media, an advertising and media company. He has comprehensive experience in areas such as interactive print, packaging, copywriting, and design. He says the one thing he wishes he had known sooner was, ‘sometimes when an idea is still at birth, not many will see it the way you do but you have to believe in it yourself. He also highlights that the best business decision you can ever make is hiring the right people.
So in our session today, we will discuss:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. progress on the community building project
04/08/22, 20:48 - Anotidaishe EWYL21E0409: Good afternoon
04/08/22, 20:48 - Anotidaishe EWYL21E0409: Okay I'm ready
04/08/22, 23:08 - Unknown: I have shared the lesson with you, I am waiting for your understanding on the same.
04/08/22, 23:08 - Unknown: Team edoofa has arranged a *webinar*  for you all, 
The webinar would be taken by *Ronard Kachage.*
Designation  at Success Magazine.

*Date  August* 
*Time  IST* 

*Takeaways from the webinar.*
The topic will be along the lines of how Mr. Kachaje went on to pursue a career in real estate by having a degree in the same field and eventually figured out his calling which was building the media brand  Magazine. One of the many benefits of starting a business or pursuing your passions when one is a bit older is that they bring all of the experience and wisdom to the table. 
The journey of Mr. Kachaje is certainly inspiring, growth-oriented, and a wonderful example for the youth of today, not only in terms of being passionate about what you believe in but also having a consistent outlook towards learning on the way and figuring things out at the same time.

My proud edoofian,
Your presence would be appreciated as we have shortlisted very less students for this webinar.
Please join 5 minutes before time as it is a very informative session so I do not want you to miss anything!
05/08/22, 02:11 - Anotidaishe EWYL21E0409: My understanding is before you do anything or when you have an idea you have to believe in yourself before anyone else
05/08/22, 02:12 - Anotidaishe EWYL21E0409: You won't get the job done with that self-confidence
05/08/22, 02:12 - Unknown: This webinar is 7 PM, tomorrow.
05/08/22, 02:13 - Anotidaishe EWYL21E0409: Thank you very much
05/08/22, 02:28 - Unknown: Reading your response Tadiwanashe filled me with so much fire, passion, and motivation. It got reminded me of one quote:
“If you want to be happy the whole life, tie it to a goal, not people or objects.”

This was the quotation given by Alert Einstein and the quote which gives the definition of a goal.
Through this lesson, my main motive was to teach you that sacrifices are required to achieve the main target, and achievement of those important aims is necessary.
Those aims are:
1. Analysis of my strength and weaknesses – because this analysis will let me know that how to work on both to make my strength more powerful and convert my weakness into my strength.
2. To be a good person and love yourself – To get positive vibes one should work on herself\/himself because “when you see yourself clearly, with eyes full of love and acceptance, you hold space for others to meet you at your highest self “(by Karly Ryan).
3. Never regret any past decision – “Every bad decision gives you a lesson and this makes one’s vision more clear towards the achievement of its goal” as it is said by a great personality that takes responsibility and initiative for yourself stop blaming your circumstances for what you can change.
4. Always give 100% – there is a frame on my living room wall, of Swami Vivekananda that always gives me motivation the quotation written in it says “Arise, awake, and do not stop until the goal is reached”.
05/08/22, 02:30 - Unknown: I would like to share something about my goals.
My goals also consist of making my parents proud of their daughter, a daughter that will give them a more comfortable life, one that is not filled with such pain. Indeed, I cannot deny that truly I am not experienced as much as some people, but at least for me, every milestone in my life is an emblem of my growth. When I can complete something new successfully or learn something from my failure instead of complaining, I think I have grown up.

06/08/22, 21:13 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

08/08/22, 18:36 - Anotidaishe EWYL21E0409: Okay ma'am
08/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: One can be called successful if they have achieved their desired goals. For some people, being successful means being rich. But being successful is even more than being rich. When you achieve what you want, it gives you immense pleasure, and that is incomparable with being rich. To be successful in any aspect of life, one needs to have strong dedication and work hard. 
Our *WEEKEND ACTIVITY* discussed the traits of a successful person.
So, in our session today, we will:
1. discuss your understanding of the weekend activity.

10/08/22, 22:44 - Unknown: Along with this, I am very excited to hear what have you learned from the weekend activity.
I would like to share what your fellow edoofians have shared, their response added so much knowledge to me.
10/08/22, 22:48 - Unknown: SATURDAY TASK RESPONSE. 
Eugene Gilbert Peters became a successful Zimbabwean superstar through his efforts to work toward his passion. 

To start with, he is evident in the way he speaks refusing to be a silent observer. This determined his present level of success. 
In addition, throughout his society, he is set apart by his genuine love for the next generation of interpreters. He hungers for every young person with a dream to get an opportunity to pursue it.
He aspires to achieve beyond the borders of his country into the continent all over the world. I take away that throughout the journey of entrepreneurship, Gilbert Eugene Peter� had a long way to go to achieve. Others discouraged him to stop, pulling backward but he never gave up. He stifled his confidence and growth to proceed.
He also educates himself to become a recognized professional of the new generation by doing a Bachelor's degree of BCA at his tertiary level education and a post-graduate qualification.
Summing up, his way of success was focusing on the dream and ignoring destroyers. He looks for a good and genuine friend with a positive attitude toward life for instance her wife.`
10/08/22, 22:49 - Unknown: I was so impressed by listening to his understanding and the way he expressed his opinions. 
You know Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi were also praising not just his response but the way he is so consistent and punctual with his sessions.
I want our sessions and interaction to be similar and want you to be outshining other students.
What do you think?
11/08/22, 23:06 - Anotidaishe EWYL21E0409: I believe I can do the same
13/08/22, 16:06 - Anotidaishe EWYL21E0409: Good morning
