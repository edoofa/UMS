16/03/23, 22:17 - Aditi Kapoor: So let us start with the Projects we have discussed before. Can you recall what are those 3 projects as discussed before?
16/03/23, 22:19 - Thubelihle EWYL22E1326: On that document we have 2 projects titled project 2
16/03/23, 22:35 - Aditi Kapoor: There are 3 Thubelihle
16/03/23, 22:37 - Aditi Kapoor: Can you recall the 2 if you remember them?
17/03/23, 00:42 - Thubelihle EWYL22E1326: Project 1 is about corporate alliances whereby I am expected to partner with organisations online either student-centric or recreational or content-centric.
Project 2 is about community building whereby I have to collaborate with other parties in order to complete goals.
The last project is the one that requires me to reach out to schools informing them about the Edoofa Scholarship program.
17/03/23, 00:44 - Aditi Kapoor: Wow you have even printed it out!!
17/03/23, 00:45 - Aditi Kapoor: if you look further, there is also project 3 in the document, which is the African Schools Reform Project
17/03/23, 00:45 - Aditi Kapoor: Can you see that?
17/03/23, 00:45 - Thubelihle EWYL22E1326: Yes Yes. That one is the last one
17/03/23, 00:46 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes and have you studied them?
17/03/23, 00:47 - Aditi Kapoor: I have also explained them properly in the EWYL Group, so do you have any queries till now?
17/03/23, 00:47 - Thubelihle EWYL22E1326: Yes Sir! It was an interesting read and I would like to keep it near me just in case i need to revisit it for clarification.
17/03/23, 00:48 - Thubelihle EWYL22E1326: Yes I have
17/03/23, 00:48 - Aditi Kapoor: That's a great approach Thubelihle
17/03/23, 00:48 - Thubelihle EWYL22E1326: No I understood during that session
17/03/23, 00:48 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes you told me that you were clear about it
17/03/23, 00:49 - Aditi Kapoor: So can you tell me which project you want to start with?
17/03/23, 00:52 - Thubelihle EWYL22E1326: Project 2
17/03/23, 00:52 - Thubelihle EWYL22E1326: I had began working on project 2
17/03/23, 00:52 - Thubelihle EWYL22E1326: I was looking for my headmaster's number from my teachers so I can get started on project 3
17/03/23, 00:58 - Aditi Kapoor: Well there are some more things about the community building project
17/03/23, 00:58 - Aditi Kapoor: For the community building project, you’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME\/MENTOR NAME\/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED
For eg: a student named Tendai who formed the group on 1st February will name it-
TENDAI\/MENTOR NAME\/1FEB2023
17/03/23, 00:58 - Aditi Kapoor: Then, we need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.
17/03/23, 00:58 - Aditi Kapoor: First of all, make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community building project, YOU ADD ME and make me the ADMIN of the Group.
Add my number 
17/03/23, 00:58 - Aditi Kapoor: The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
17/03/23, 01:20 - Thubelihle EWYL22E1326: Yes Sir. I have taken note of what has been stated above
17/03/23, 01:28 - Thubelihle EWYL22E1326: I will do so

20/03/23, 17:42 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my proud Edoofian!

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!","transform":"

20/03/23, 19:41 - Aditi Kapoor: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

22/03/23, 22:56 - Aditi Kapoor: The concept of wealth has been a topic of much debate and discussion for centuries. While some view wealth as a means to achieve success and fulfillment, others may view it with suspicion or even disdain. However, it is important to understand that ethical wealth creation is possible and can be a force for good in the world. In this regard, it is essential to examine our own perspectives on wealth creation, and consider how they may impact our relationship with money, status, and success.","transform":"

I am pleased to observe that a majority of you comprehended well, the message  that was conveyed in this week's Wednesday wisdom. It brought me great joy to go through student’s perspectives on wealth creation and the mindset essential for embarking on this path.

I have a special Saturday assignment for you. The objective of this assignment is to help you understand the steps you can take to prepare yourself for wealth creation. The assignment will encourage you to identify their goals, develop a financial plan, and cultivate the mindset and habits needed to achieve financial success.

Here are some instructions to make it easy for you to work on this assignment:
1. Goal Setting: The first step towards wealth creation is to set clear and achievable goals. In this section, write down your short-term and long-term financial goals. Explain how each goal will contribute to your overall financial success.
2. Financial Planning: A financial plan is a roadmap that outlines how you will achieve your financial goals. In this section, develop a comprehensive financial plan that includes strategies for budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management. Identify the resources you will need to achieve your financial plan and explain how you will access them.
3. Mindset and Habits: Wealth creation is not just about having a financial plan; it is also about cultivating the mindset and habits that will help you achieve your goals. In this section, identify the mindset and habits that are necessary for financial success. Explain how you will cultivate these qualities in yourself and develop strategies to overcome any obstacles that may arise.
4. Conclusion: In this section, summarize your findings and discuss the importance of preparing yourself for wealth creation. Reflect on what you have learned throughout the assignment and discuss how you will apply these principles in your own life.
