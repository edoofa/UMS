25/07/22, 03:17 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:09 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

I hope all is well with you. 

Effective and timely feedback is a crucial part of a successful performance, as I discussed with you in our Saturday activity. Before our Session , I wanted to get in touch with you to share your EWYL report card and ask you to evaluate your performance by responding to the following questions:

1. How would you rate your performance from 1-10, 10 being the highest score?
2. What is your goal- in terms of skills and amount of scholarship credits that you want to earn?
3. What is your plan- how will you achieve the above mentioned goal?

The answers you give here will be evaluated by Ms Deepali and Ms Davi. So take you time and share your responses here in the group itself before our session.
13/12/22, 21:06 - Adella EWYL22E0158: 1. 8-10
2. To earn at least 10% of the remaining in the remaining 50%
3. Working hard by engaging myself more to the projects

13/12/22, 21:14 - Jasmine Kaur: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
