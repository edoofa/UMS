13/07/22, 16:15 - Unknown: Good Morning, Ropafadzo ?
I hope that you are good health and spirits
13/07/22, 16:15 - Unknown: Great!
Before we start our discussion on your Project Progress Form, May I know if you have gone through the video link that I shared with you in your EWYL Group last weekend?
13/07/22, 16:21 - Ropafadzo EWYL21E0632: Good morning sir..how are you
13/07/22, 16:21 - Ropafadzo EWYL21E0632: I did
13/07/22, 17:51 - Unknown: That's Great!
Can you share your thoughts on the video?
Which part resonated with you the most?
14/07/22, 01:09 - Ropafadzo EWYL21E0632: Was amused by the fact that Mr Anhad took his time to visit Africa..it really showed edoofa cares for our background areas and we appreciate
14/07/22, 16:32 - Unknown: Good Morning, Ropafadzo ?
I hope that you are good health and spirits
14/07/22, 16:32 - Unknown: Yes, You are right!
I am sure that you must be motivated after seeing the video, right?
18/07/22, 18:05 - Ropafadzo EWYL21E0632: Good morning sir
18/07/22, 18:05 - Ropafadzo EWYL21E0632: I am A proud edoofian
18/07/22, 18:07 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

I hope that you are doing well

As August Intake is right at our doorsteps, So due to this many of our Edoofians will be arriving here in India to kick start their dream journey.?

I feel that it is my duty to make sure that the university has prepared well for their onboarding process.

This is why I would be visiting the universities Today in order to do a personal check up.
Since, This process would take up lots of time that is why we won't be able to connect Today.
However, I am sure that in my absence, You will make sure that you follow the below given things:

1. Make sure to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual at 9 AM Tomorrow.
2. Do submit the Wednesday Lesson before the deadline.
25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:07 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:33 - Unknown: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



Independence Day promotes nationalism and patriotism toward the nation. It is one of the great days everyone remembers the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to get Independence. India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

This weekend, I would like you to take some rest and make a revised plan for yourself because the last week, We haven't made any productive progress.
Let us aim at working with complete efficiency from now on and earn the Scholarship Credits we deserve.
We won't be having any sessions Today and Sunday, But I would get in touch with you in case I require any updates on the EWYL Projects, okay?

Also, I would want you to follow the points given below:
◼️Make sure that you follow the Proud Edoofian ritual (Even on Sunday?). This will show your seriousness.
◼️Keep an eye on the Saturday Activity that will be shared in your batch group as well as on this line if you follow the above point.
◼️Also, If you haven't submitted the Wednesday Lesson yet, Please make sure that you submit it as soon as possible.

03/10/22, 03:02 - Ropafadzo EWYL21E0632: This one is teaching us that in life you have to work extremely hard to get where you want...you can never succed using shortcuts..and shortcuts lead to dangerous pathways mostly
03/10/22, 03:42 - Ropafadzo EWYL21E0632: This quote tells us that making shortcuts actually become more tiring than the actual route..and might actually take more if your time
03/10/22, 03:43 - Ropafadzo EWYL21E0632: The quote teaches us to plan all our works and work hard towards them so we might prosper

Also poor planning leads to poverty

03/10/22, 15:46 - Unknown: Exactly the mindset required to start your Monday, Ropafadzo
