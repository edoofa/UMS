15/11/22, 00:30 - Aisha EWYL22E0710: 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Aisha P T Mawere and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Aisha EWYL22EO710
15/11/22, 00:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Aisha!
How are you?
15/11/22, 00:39 - Saloni Rastogi: I know we have both been connected in the EWYL Journey for a long time now and I very well know how dedicatedly and consistently you work and make every session's discussion very productive and interactive. 
This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

*SESSIONS' DAYS*- I know you are very well aware that your sessions are scheduled on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* on the _EWYL Line from 01:00-02:30 PM_.

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday. 
_Sessions will be held only on the EWYL Line_.
_Keep following the daily ritual of saying *' I am a proud Edoofian'* on the EWYL Line._
In cases where you are not able to attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
Hoping for an amazing week with you.?
15/11/22, 00:42 - Aisha EWYL22E0710: Thank you
15/11/22, 18:51 - Saloni Rastogi: Good morning Aisha!
How are you?
15/11/22, 18:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Please follow the daily ritual for today.
15/11/22, 18:52 - Saloni Rastogi: I hope you remeber that.
15/11/22, 18:56 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
15/11/22, 18:56 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
15/11/22, 21:25 - Aisha EWYL22E0710: I am proud to be an edoofian
16/11/22, 14:44 - Aisha EWYL22E0710: I am proud to be an edoofian
16/11/22, 21:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Aisha!
How are you?
16/11/22, 21:30 - Saloni Rastogi: I am glad to see your enthusiasm to follow the daily ritual, but I would like to correct you a bit here. The daily ritual is 'I am a proud edoofian' and not 'I am proud to be an edoofian'.
16/11/22, 21:31 - Saloni Rastogi: I hope you will keep that in mind.
16/11/22, 21:31 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, my dear proud Edoofian. I hope all is well with you.

Another insightful Wednesday Wisdom is presented here. The lesson today teaches us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, disability. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition. A few questions near the end of the session will ask you to reflect and have an open dialogue with yourself. After you finish your lesson, as your mentor, I'd like to have a thorough conversation about your key take aways, in our upcoming sessions.

Enjoy the article and keep in mind that success does not come to you suddenly; rather, it can be attained over time by making modest, daily improvements.

Happy learning!
17/11/22, 22:03 - Aisha EWYL22E0710: I am a proud edoofian
17/11/22, 22:04 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

It was very amazingly penned down by Ms. Davi and some of my students shared an eye-opening understanding on the same as well.

30/12/22, 21:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
