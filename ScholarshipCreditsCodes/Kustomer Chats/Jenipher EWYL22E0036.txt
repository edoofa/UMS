04/08/22, 03:40 - Jenipher EWYL22E0036: Good day,my major take aways and the inspiration l got from Gilbert Eugene Peter's story,firstly his story inspired me that nomatter how young you are you can achieve everything you want as long as you have full focus and passion for what you want to do for instance Eugene Peter's started his graphic design at the age of 15 hence it shows that age is just a number it does not stop one to fulfill his\/ her dreams
04/08/22, 04:02 - Jenipher EWYL22E0036: The other inspirational message l got from Gilbert Eugene Peter's story is when he said that  one thing he wishes he had known sooner was, ‚Äòthat sometimes when an idea is still at\r
birth, not many will see it the way you do but you have to believe in it yourself. He also highlights that the best business\r
decision you can ever make is hiring the right people. On the flip side, the worst business mistake you can ever make\r
is partnering with the wrong people. He even says he had to ride solo because of hurdles that had arisen from bad,h henceforth this inspired me alot

06/08/22, 17:24 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.

09/08/22, 03:08 - Jenipher EWYL22E0036: The secrets of Gilbert's success was when he Started to work at an internet Caf√© as an assistant hence it was his first job after he finished his ordinary level.l n addition he was also working part time as a home  satellite dish installer.T he part time grew to an extent of tagging his two buddies along.Moreover the traits that made him successful  is when he started a company called Spidex Media when he was only 21 years of age with only $300.His girlfriend also gave him her whole $160 salary to use for office space rental thus are the traits which made him successful.

Correspondingly,his firm belief in God also led to his success for instance he said that, \"I believe that when you step into your purpose, there are people that are put in your path to help\"
11/08/22, 22:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying ‚Äú I am a Proud Edoofian!‚Äù","transform":"
