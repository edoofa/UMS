25/08/22, 00:21 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: Hello ma'am
25/08/22, 18:01 - Unknown: Greetings of the day!
How are you doing today?
25/08/22, 18:02 - Unknown: For better clarity and communication, may I please know your full name or EWYL Group name?
I would really appreciate the information.
25/08/22, 18:30 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: My full name is Simbarashe Mushonga
25/08/22, 18:51 - Unknown: Hello, I am Ms,Riva.
 I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times pere week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind 
25/08/22, 19:01 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: Well understood Ms Riva,
25/08/22, 19:30 - Unknown: Today I wanted to discuss the recent message I shared with you. The message that we want to be our daily habit, our words of connecting and experiencing a sense of belonging, We all at team Edoofa are very thrilled as we personally are undertaking the same activity. May I know what have you understood from this message, what is the intention behind the same?
03/11/22, 03:22 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: How are you Ma'am, these days I'm writing my Zimsec final examinations that is why I am unavailable
04/11/22, 00:26 - Unknown: Hello my proud edoofian, 
I understand but you should at least keep me informed about the same!
04/11/22, 02:47 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: Ok ma'am thank you for your understanding
04/11/22, 18:48 - Unknown: Yes edoofian
04/11/22, 18:49 - Unknown: I see you have received my messages but have not reverted to them, may I know if anything is occupying you?
Simbarshe, I am always here to help you out. First of all, please make one thing clear I will not burden you with messages or information until you are willing. I know you are very much interested in resuming this EWYL journey with us and have full capabilities to come out brilliantly but you should know that you have to take some steps forward along with me so that we can come out as the best team. Secondly, even if you are unaware of the projects or lack knowledge of any other information, you don't have to worry. I am always here to help you out. Please, edoofian,I want you to resume this knowledge and learning experience with me.
Please revert to this message so that we can plan our sessions.
05/11/22, 00:58 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: It's only because of the examinations I'm am writing these days ma'am but I'm finishing them on 16 November.
08/11/22, 00:46 - Unknown: I understand edoofian but you can take out 10 15 mins of the day
08/11/22, 18:44 - Unknown: Happy Guru Nanak Jayanti!
Guru Nanak Jayanti (also Gurpurab) is the birthday anniversary of the first Sikh guru and founder of Sikhism, Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji. He was born on this day in the year 1469 on Karthik Purnima, which is the fifteenth lunar day in the month of Kartik according to the Hindu calendar. It usually falls in the month of November as per the Gregorian calendar.
15/11/22, 00:43 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: How are you Ms Riva, I am Simbarashe Mushonga, I've finished my examinations. I am fully available from now on.
15/11/22, 19:19 - Unknown: Hola my proud edoofian,
Today is not just Tuesday, it is Transformation Tuesday. That means that success does not just come to you, you have to go out and get it. So what are you waiting for?
15/11/22, 20:18 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: I Am A Proud Edoofian!!
15/11/22, 20:19 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
16/11/22, 00:58 - Unknown: Okay so Simbarshe, now it’s time that we give direction to your projects

16/11/22, 04:08 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: I understand ma'am, thank you
16/11/22, 06:01 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: 1
16/11/22, 18:36 - Unknown: Greetings Simbarashe,
Let us discuss the community building  project in detail!
We will keep that as a priority!
16/11/22, 22:36 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: Afternoon Ma'am,

17/11/22, 00:16 - Unknown: So let us start
17/11/22, 00:23 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: Community building is essential because it enables  people to share experiences and learn from each other. Empowering each other, inspiring one another and support is also the importance of community building. The other importance of community building is that it is about collective learning, engaging with collective growth. It also allows trust building amongst the people in the community.
17/11/22, 19:04 - Unknown: Greetings, right and what type of communication we will keep with such students I will be informing you about the same

19/11/22, 21:06 - Unknown: Good day edoofian ,
Hope everything is well at your end!
I would like to share a brief message about the importance of planning in our lives and as an organization as well!
Planning is definitely significant as it directs us where to go, it furnishes direction and decreases the danger of risk by making predictions. The significant advantages of planning are provided below:
Planning provides directions: Planning assures that the objectives are certainly asserted so that they serve as a model for determining what action should be taken and in which direction. If objects are well established, employees are informed of what the company has to do and what they need do to accomplish those purposes.
Planning decreases the chances of risk: Planning is an activity which permits a manager to look forward and predict changes. By determining in prior the tasks to be completed, planning notes the way to deal with changes and unpredictable effects.
Planning decreases overlapping and wasteful activities: Planning works as the foundation of organising the activities and purposes of distinct branches, departments, and people. It assists in avoiding chaos and confusion. Since planning guarantees precision in understanding and action, work is conducted on easily without delays.
19/11/22, 21:14 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: Very well understood ma'am, Planning is very essential.
19/11/22, 22:37 - Unknown: Now, please let me know what did you understand from the above text and how should we execute the same?
Which EWYL project are you currently working on and how will you use planning function  in that?
19/11/22, 23:49 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: I understood that Planing is very important in that it provides directions, an activity which reduces chances of risks. It also allows the owner of a company to look forward and predict changes. It helps in avoiding chaos and confusion.
19/11/22, 23:49 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: I am about to attend the school I used to learn and tell them about Edoofa Program and how it works. I'm going to start the program this upcoming week.
20/11/22, 05:03 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: 1
20/11/22, 18:46 - Unknown: Greetings Simbarashe, 
Yes you are absolutely right!

I hope you are done with the target for this week?
20/11/22, 21:24 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: I Am A Proud Edoofian!!!
20/11/22, 21:25 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride.

21/11/22, 18:46 - Unknown: Hello my proud edoofian, hope you had a great weekend!
Also, I wanted to communicate one thing with all my students
To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer and your EWYL Mentor.
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages. Let us get a better understanding of the three stages!
21/11/22, 18:47 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: I Am A Proud Edoofian!!
21/11/22, 18:48 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: Good morning ma'am.
21/11/22, 18:48 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: I'm listening ma'am
21/11/22, 18:49 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
21/11/22, 18:49 - Unknown: Have you completed the target?
21/11/22, 18:50 - Unknown: Your *counselor* is your first point of contact. Your counselor has been guiding you during your onboarding process where you learnt about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same.
        After that, you are contacted by your *Admissions Officer* {Miss Vilsha\/Mr. Milan}.I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now you must be aware that all your admissions related queries like: your VISA process, Registration fees, AAL etc. would be addressed\/handled by the Admissions Team.
Note: Your EWYL mentor\/counselor will not be addressing your admission queries
        Finally you will be starting your EWYL journey with your *EWYL Mentor*, where you get a chance to learn 21st century job skills and earn your scholarship credits which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
21/11/22, 18:57 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: Noted ma'am, I clearly understand
21/11/22, 18:58 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: Yes ma'am, I've completed the target

16/12/22, 20:09 - Unknown: Hello, my proud edoofian!
Let us start your session.
I have a simple riddle for you to start with:
You can see it every day, but you cannot touch it. What is it?
16/12/22, 20:31 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: It is The Sky
16/12/22, 21:37 - Unknown: It is the sky!
My proud edoofian with the competence and consistency you can touch the sky as well. With the right kind of determination everything is possible.
16/12/22, 22:01 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: That is true ma'am
17/12/22, 02:01 - Unknown: Effective and timely feedback is a crucial part of a successful performance, as I discussed with you in our Saturday activity. I wanted to get in touch with you to share your EWYL report card and ask you to evaluate your performance by responding to the following questions:

1. How would you rate your performance from 1-10, 10 being the highest score?
2. What is your goal- in terms of skills and amount of scholarship credits that you want to earn?
3. What is your plan- how will you achieve the above mentioned goal?

The answers you give here will be evaluated by Ms Deepali and Ms Davi. So take you time and share your responses here in the group itself.
17/12/22, 02:08 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: I'll share my responses ma'am.
17/12/22, 02:18 - Unknown: Simbarashe, could you please share them now so that we can discuss some of them?
17/12/22, 02:46 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: 1) I would rate myself 8 out of 10

2)I would want to earn the amount of $150. 

3)I would like to let other students join the Edoofa program, therefore expanding our student community building.
17/12/22, 02:48 - Unknown: What is your plan now to achieve the targets? 
What do you think should be your next step?
17/12/22, 03:04 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: My plan to achieve the targets is to inform and to  let other students join the Edoofa Scholarship Program. I've already created a group where I'm informing other of my students about the Program.
17/12/22, 03:50 - Unknown: I will help you with some tips:
1. Have a plan
Set goals at the beginning of the project and note the date. Have a deadline for it as well, it is good to manage the goals. Decide at the beginning how often you are going to work on the project.
2. Listen and listen
Listening in my opinion is more important than saying anything. Listen to the other person's problems and just by being there you might help the other person to think out loud and share their thoughts with you [ in reference to school headmasters and other students ].
17/12/22, 04:34 - Simbarashe EWYL22E0470: Noted ma'am, thank you.
17/12/22, 21:14 - Unknown: 3. Make time
Being a hardworking person is not easy, it consumes time, not only from the meetings but you need to prepare and do some research before every meeting. Be prepared to spend some time on this.

4. Be honest
If people ask you a question and you don’t know the answer, be honest, don’t make up an answer just to show that you are never wrong.You don’t have all the answers in the world. If you don’t know the answer for a problem, look for it, or even better, look for it together with your mentor.
