22/12/22, 18:32 - Chiedza EWYL22E0283: I intend to broaden the student community by reaching out to students who are in their final High School year and introduce the Edoofa scholarship program idea to them by showing them posters and also sharing with them the journey I've had with Edoofa so far. This is so that they can also apply for the scholarship and plan for their tertiary Education wisely.
