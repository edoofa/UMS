23/05/23, 09:45 - Shantel EWYL23E0054: The EWYL programme helps students to acquire skills of the 21st century jobs industry, leadership is one of the skills leant through the EWYL programme. Through the EWYL programme l intend to master the skill of leadership through partaking in various projects that requires one to be involved with people, discussing with them or even educating them about  certain topics . This will help me to acquire courage, Empathy, Empowering and Storytelling and public speaking skills which are essential for leaders to have such qualities. I would also aquire the skill of adopting a different perspective as there is a possibility if learning new ideas from the discussions l would be having with different kinds of people. 

In order for my name to be in the next list of the student leaders of the community l will ensure to work hard, be humble, be polite and give respect to people as leaders should be. It is said that leaders should lead by example hence l would be doing such so that the other students do well under my leadership and excel both professionally and in the society

29/05/23, 19:23 - Saloni Rastogi: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
