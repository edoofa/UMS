It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.

09/06/23, 16:12 - Tatenda EWYL22E1031: The Wednesday lesson taught me that in a business world you should develop a competitive advantage and make use of your unique skills strengths and passion in order to achieve, embrace a permanent beta mindset constantly improve your self to adapt to the world and its demands, be able to make a network intelligence and create a good networking in your business world especially on social media, you also be able to take intelligent risks to gain more and view a failure as a learning opportunity and already have mitigations before risking
09/06/23, 16:14 - Ananya: I completely agree with the lessons you learned on Wednesday. In the business world, it's crucial to develop a competitive advantage by leveraging your unique skills, strengths, and passion. Embracing a mindset of continuous improvement and adaptation, known as a permanent beta mindset, is essential to stay relevant in a changing world.
09/06/23, 16:14 - Tatenda EWYL22E1031: You should also be able to build strong alliances in your business world and lastly pivot strategically and adapt to new circumstances in an ever changing world, be able to recognize when it's time to make a career pivot
09/06/23, 16:14 - Tatenda EWYL22E1031: Noted
09/06/23, 16:15 - Ananya: So, Tatenda I have a favorite part of the Wednesday lesson: Pivot Strategically: The ability to pivot and adapt to new circumstances is crucial in an ever-changing world. The authors explain how to recognize when it's time to make a career pivot and provide insights into managing transitions effectively. They emphasize the importance of maintaining a growth mindset and being proactive in shaping your own future.
09/06/23, 16:16 - Tatenda EWYL22E1031: Okay
09/06/23, 16:17 - Ananya: I want to highlight the importance of this because as you prepare to leave your home and embark on your new journey in India, you may encounter various challenges. However, it is essential to adapt to these new circumstances in order to foster personal growth. Embracing change and being open to new experiences will not only help you navigate the challenges but also provide opportunities for growth and development. Therefore, it's crucial to be adaptable and embrace the changes that come your way as you embark on this new chapter of your life in India.

To help you make the most of all the projects available, I have devised a target table that has proven to be successful for many of my students. By following this target, you can contribute your time in a smart way and earn many credits along the way.
09/06/23, 16:29 - Tatenda EWYL22E1031: Noted

09/06/23, 16:33 - Tatenda EWYL22E1031: Okay
09/06/23, 16:35 - Ananya: Now, let us begin with the second project!
09/06/23, 16:36 - Tatenda EWYL22E1031: Okay
09/06/23, 16:58 - Ananya: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
09/06/23, 16:58 - Ananya: Mentor-  *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
09/06/23, 17:02 - Ananya: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
09/06/23, 17:02 - Ananya: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
09/06/23, 17:02 - Ananya: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
09/06/23, 17:02 - Ananya: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
09/06/23, 17:02 - Ananya: Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
09/06/23, 17:03 - Tatenda EWYL22E1031: Okay noted

09/06/23, 17:03 - Ananya: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about

Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
09/06/23, 17:03 - Ananya: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe.
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
09/06/23, 17:04 - Ananya: .
09/06/23, 17:04 - Ananya: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
09/06/23, 17:04 - Ananya: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
09/06/23, 17:04 - Ananya: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

09/06/23, 17:28 - Tatenda EWYL22E1031: Okay
10/06/23, 12:59 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week’s Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better—together. It’s why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger—as successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!

15/06/23, 10:40 - Tatenda EWYL22E1031: Deepening my relations is a necessity in creating my carrier path as a student who opted to take part towards success with edoofa program. I can make this a success by adhering to all my duties in order to be in good books with my mentors, making great conversations with people and listening more in order for me to gain something in each and every conversation that l make. Motivating others towards success is one characteristic of a good leader, as for my friends they are already motivated about how Edoofa can help us achieve our dreams abroad with affordable but quality learning.
