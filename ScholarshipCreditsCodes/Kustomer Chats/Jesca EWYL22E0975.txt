25/05/23, 16:02 - Ananya: A lovely good morning to my Proud Edoofian! 

On this Africa Day, I would like to extend my heartfelt wishes to you. As students, you are the future leaders, innovators, and change-makers who will shape Africa's destiny.ðŸŒŸ

On this special day, let us take a moment to reflect on the achievements and progress that Africa has made, while also acknowledging the challenges that lie ahead. Africa is a land of incredible beauty, resilience, and untapped potential. As students, you have the power to unlock that potential and make a positive impact on your communities, your countries, and the entire continent.âœ¨
25/05/23, 16:04 - Ananya: I am sorry Jesca, I am unable to understand which application you are exactly talking about.
25/05/23, 16:06 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: Thank you sir
25/05/23, 16:06 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: https://chat.whatsapp.com/J2Cse1DLaWz1SNAy2QJBKw

25/05/23, 16:13 - Ananya: I understand, it is just the Whatsapp dear!
25/05/23, 16:31 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: Okay mam
25/05/23, 16:34 - Ananya: So, what are your plans for celebrating Africa day today?
25/05/23, 16:38 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: Actually I don't have any.
25/05/23, 16:39 - Ananya: Why dear?
25/05/23, 16:45 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: Uuuuum I really don't know plus  am broke . Can't really anything without money
25/05/23, 16:49 - Ananya: Well, you can make good food at home and celebrate!
25/05/23, 17:05 - Ananya: Our session for today has come to an end. Your enthusiasm and curiosity have been truly motivating, and I am confident that you will bring the same level of energy and passion to our upcoming session on Saturday and I am excited to announce that it is going to be a video session. I will share the link with you shortly.
25/05/23, 17:08 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: Yah I know but that is not fun
25/05/23, 17:08 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: Going out is fun spending bucks with family. Don't you think??
25/05/23, 17:08 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: Thank you
25/05/23, 17:11 - Ananya: Certainly! I completely understand, Jesca. It's important for us to cherish what we already have and seek happiness within those things. Discovering moments of laughter and joy doesn't necessarily require money. Instead, we can embrace our creativity and find ways to improvise, allowing our happiness to blossom. It's about finding simple pleasures and making the most of what we have. Trust me, happiness is within your reach, and it's all about embracing the wonderful possibilities that surround you.
25/05/23, 17:14 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: Okay thank you for the lesson sir, will surely cherish that
29/05/23, 16:01 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: I am a proud Edoofian
29/05/23, 16:01 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
29/05/23, 16:02 - Ananya: May I ask why are you late for the session?
29/05/23, 16:03 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: I was finishing the task you gave me
29/05/23, 16:03 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: 
29/05/23, 16:03 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: Yes
29/05/23, 16:09 - Ananya: Alright, Jesca! Would you like to share a few characteristics of a Gold personality?
29/05/23, 16:10 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: Actually I didn't read them
29/05/23, 16:13 - Ananya: May I ask why?
29/05/23, 16:19 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: I didn't see the part
29/05/23, 16:22 - Ananya: That is aright, 
So, may I know if you were able to attend the meet and greet or you will be going to Bulawayo?
29/05/23, 16:25 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: I was hoping I could attend in Bulawayo

08/06/23, 17:03 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. 
The term hero originates from the Greek word "heros," which means protector. The idea
of a hero has been present for many centuries, with its earliest mention in Homer's Iliad.
In the past, heroes were often portrayed as strong and warrior-like figures who provided
physical protection to others. This perception of heroes has been reflected in folklore and
mythology throughout history.
Today, the term hero is still commonly used in everyday language and the media. A
recent study conducted across 25 countries found that participants had at least
one personal hero. This indicates that the concept of a hero remains relevant and
meaningful to people worldwide.
08/06/23, 17:06 - Jesca EWYL22E0975: Network issues and electricity issues, since morning till now there is no network which leads to network difficulty
