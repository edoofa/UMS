22/06/23, 19:03 - Bridget EWYL23E0216: The key points I learned from the Wedneday Wisdom are that trust and honesty are an essential qualities of a leader and an individual as this can build trust and promote a culture of fairness.Another lesson is that we should not be discouraged by difficulties but use them as opportunities to grow and strive for more. True leadership requires one to make difficult decisions and the compassion to help others.As Edoofians we should embrace the ability to effect change regardless of out age and leave behind a mark in out various community.Mrs Sirleaf becoming the first female president in Africa pushes us to advocate for equal opportunities and end gender based discrimination as this could unlock countless opportunities for us.
23/06/23, 17:33 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Edoofian,
We hope this message finds you well in your academic pursuits. We are excited to share a Saturday activity centered around learning from influential personalities. Our chosen figure is Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of Liberia and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Through her remarkable leadership and unwavering determination, she has left an indelible mark on history. Let's draw valuable lessons from her life for our personal development.

Two traits that stand out about Ellen Johnson Sirleaf are resilience and visionary leadership. These qualities can greatly contribute to our growth and development as individuals. They can positively impact our academic pursuits, relationships, and future career goals.

To develop resilience, we can learn from Sirleaf's ability to bounce back from challenges. We can seek out difficult experiences and learn from them, cultivating a mindset of perseverance and adaptability.

Here are some suggestions to help you get started:

Identify two traits: Reflect on Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's qualities that resonate with you.

Reflect on personal development: Consider how these traits can positively impact your academic pursuits, relationships, or future career goals.

Create an action plan: Outline practical steps like seeking mentorship, practicing self-discipline, engaging in community service, or pursuing relevant courses and extracurricular activities.
Let's embark on this exciting journey together and make Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's legacy an integral part of our own lives.
Best regards,

Team Edoofa

23/06/23, 19:01 - Bridget EWYL23E0216: Participating in youth empowerment workshops helps to plant the seed of optimism and perseverance within other individuals and can help uplift society.

Let us look back when Edoofa proudly joins the continent in celebrating Africa Day, a day filled with unity, pride, and the vibrant spirit of Africa! 

Link: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CstsaGOJ0Yj/?igshid=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==

We are honored to have such incredible Edoofians from across Africa, each one representing the rich diversity, talent, and brilliance that the continent possesses. Drop your feelings in the comments below!
29/06/23, 17:34 - Bridget EWYL23E0216: Thank you for sharingg
29/06/23, 17:35 - Bridget EWYL23E0216: This was beautiful
29/06/23, 17:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Bridget!
How are you?
29/06/23, 17:43 - Saloni Rastogi: I hope you know that you did not receive the Wednesday lesson yesterday. Do you know why is that so?
29/06/23, 17:43 - Bridget EWYL23E0216: Greetings to you too
29/06/23, 17:43 - Bridget EWYL23E0216: I assume it is because of the grant
29/06/23, 18:02 - Saloni Rastogi: No, it is because you have not followed the daily ritual in the past two days. Can you share why is that?
29/06/23, 18:03 - Bridget EWYL23E0216: My sincereapologies,I thought I was only supposed to do that on days when I jave sessions.It will not happen again.
29/06/23, 18:07 - Bridget EWYL23E0216: Since we began the two sessions per week I had been doing so therefore since we had seemed not to have a problem I assumed that is how I am required to do it.It was not my intention.
29/06/23, 18:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
29/06/23, 18:08 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
29/06/23, 18:11 - Bridget EWYL23E0216: This is well noted
29/06/23, 18:14 - Bridget EWYL23E0216: My apologies it was not out of unwillingness but a misunderstanding on my part.
29/06/23, 18:25 - Saloni Rastogi: No worries it is alright!
29/06/23, 18:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Did you read the grant document shared with you?
29/06/23, 18:26 - Bridget EWYL23E0216: Yes I did go through it
29/06/23, 18:37 - Saloni Rastogi: I am sharing standard information with you for the grant document shared yesterday. Make sure you have your full attention.
29/06/23, 18:37 - Saloni Rastogi: In these 21 days, I want that we engage in the best possible manner to bring out fruitful results.

So this time you have to be *REGULAR IN YOUR SESSIONS*


Before we begin, let's go over what a complete session involves. 📚

▪️ First of all, you have to *come to the EWYL LINE every single day and tell me HOW PROUD ARE YOU being an Edoofian* (Including Sundays and even on days you don't have your session). This means _following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' without fail on the EWYL Line._

▪️ Secondly, It's essential to *arrive on time for the session*, as being late will not be considered as attending a session. _This brings the importance of being punctual for the session._

▪️ During our sessions, we'll cover two key topics: the *Wednesday Lesson or Weekend Activity* and *Project Updates*


To ensure your progress, I will ask for your Lessons or Activities submissions during the session. It's essential to be prepared and ready to share your work when prompted.🎓
29/06/23, 18:41 - Bridget EWYL23E0216: Thank you.This is well noted.
29/06/23, 18:46 - Saloni Rastogi: Now, let's talk about a challenge that is included in the above-mentioned Project Update! ✈️
I have set a target for the next 21 days, which involves sharing:


*45 Community Building forms*
and
*2 School Connect forms*


To mark a session as completed, your active presence is required throughout our session time. If you encounter any network or mobile issues, I recommend addressing them beforehand so that we can make the most of our time together.

Remember, excuses won't be accepted because I believe in your determination.
29/06/23, 18:48 - Bridget EWYL23E0216: I am following
29/06/23, 18:54 - Saloni Rastogi: Coming to the point that you might have also noticed and something that brings a flavor to this challenge is Extra Curricular activity


When it comes to overall assessment and evaluation, we believe it's not just about projects and lessons. It's about how passionate you are about yourself. Therefore, there is another aspect for evaluation, which is extracurricular activities.

In the next 21 days, It's your turn to show your amazing talent and be better than all the other students in this thrilling competition. Show everyone what you can do and make them amazed by your skills.

As your mentor, I want you to tell me about what else you are good at besides academics and share your idea of how you will showcase that talent to us.
29/06/23, 19:00 - Bridget EWYL23E0216: I am good at writing short poems and prose and I intend to show this by sharing short inspirational poetry pieces with you during our sessions.I used to compete in primary however in secondary there were no competitions at the schools I attended
30/06/23, 11:10 - Bridget EWYL23E0216: I am a proud EDOOFIAN.

01/07/23, 14:40 - Bridget EWYL23E0216: I was waiting for a cue so i thought to initiate the conversation.
01/07/23, 14:56 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!
01/07/23, 14:56 - Saloni Rastogi: I am sharing standard information with you for the grant document shared yesterday. Make sure you have your full attention.
01/07/23, 14:58 - Saloni Rastogi: I see that I shared all the information with you and you talked about writing poems. I would recommend that you write poems and creatively share them with me so that I can feature them on Social media page of Edoofa.
