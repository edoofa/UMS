06/03/23, 18:06 - Jasmine Kaur: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he‚Äôd received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he‚Äôd paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

‚ÄúYour honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,‚Äù he replied.

‚ÄúHow do you weight the butter then?‚Äù Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

‚ÄúYour honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I‚Äôve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it‚Äôs the baker.‚Äù

Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?
This week‚Äôs Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better‚Äîtogether. It‚Äôs why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger‚Äîas successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.
As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.
Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.

Till then Happy Learning!

Check out this amazing fact for Factual Friday and tell us if you want to visit there in the comments below!
16/07/23, 16:49 - Khumalo EWYL22E0877: consistent is when one is kin to achieve all goals set. It is when one have a culture of doing the same thing repeatedly. Which as a result leads to mastering and achieving of the concepts. 


As a student is best to remain consistent with our studies so that we will pass and have a successful life. 


My role model is Strive Masiiwa of Econet Wireless. Mr Masiiwa rose from an ordinary Zimbabwean to a multi-millionaire owing to consistent hard work and determination. I cherish Mr Masiiwa because his hard work yielded positive results. 


His company has diversified and spread across Africa.I admire success behaviors like organization, taking action, personal care, positive attitude, networking, frugality, rising early, and sharing.

 Equipped with such success behaviors one is sure to achieve intended goals and not to prey for luck . 

Therefore consistency proves to strengthen one's desire to come true.
16/07/23, 17:11 - Khumalo EWYL22E0877: *Wednesday *wisdom* 

From the weeks lesson I have learnt a lot from Sundar Pichai. Some the lessons include Perseverance in the face of challenges, embrace education and intellectual curiosity, pursue passion and purpose, leadership and vision, this is to mention some among others. Therefore the below essay seeks to give a detailed information about the lessons that us as students learn from Sundar Pichai. 

To commence with, Perseverance in the face of challenges, Sundar Pichai went a journey with a lot of obstacles. Despite the fact that he had limited resources he was able to come over those obstacles and challenges that he faced because of his determination and resilience. Therefore, students can learn from him, no matter what we face we can overcome it despite our backgrounds. 

Embrace education and intellectual curiosity is another lesson that I got from Sundar Pichai. His commitment to learning and intellectual growth played a pivotal role in his success. The lesson I got from that is continuous learning is essential for personal and professional development. 

Leadership and vision is a very important lesson that I learnt from Sundar Pichai. Since I am a student who needs to study law I have learnt that leadership and vision mindset is very important for me to achieve my goals 

All in all, I have learnt a lot from Sundar Pichai. These lessons include Perseverance in the face of challenges,leadership and vision, this is to mention some among others

2.To be honest I'm doing nothing in the African School Education Reform Mission ü§¢
3.There are a lot of challenges that I'm currently facing in the Community Building project. One of the challenges is that there are other students who are right there in India spreading lies about Edoofa for example they say Edoofa is a scam so it's hard for us as students to change those lies and unveil the truth do them. Thereby this makes my community building project very law. Moreover, In Zimbabwe Edoofa is a new thing so its hard for us to teach students from scratch.
