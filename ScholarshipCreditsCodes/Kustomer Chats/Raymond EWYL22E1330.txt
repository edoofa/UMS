23/06/23, 14:49 - Raymond EWYL22E1330: Greetings Mr Maurice, I am Raymond and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Raymond EWYL22E1330
23/06/23, 18:56 - Ananya: Hello Raymond, Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Line. Here we practice a 'mantra' where you should always start and end the day by saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' to boost your energy!
23/06/23, 18:56 - Ananya: we shall be having our session on Monday and Thursday at 12 PM-2PM so be sure to come on time 5 minutes before and share the mantra “I am a proud Edoofian” to mark your attendance.
23/06/23, 18:56 - Ananya: Sorry, we shall be having our session on Tuesday and Friday at 12 PM-2PM so be sure to come on time 5 minutes before and share the mantra “I am a proud Edoofian” to mark your attendance.
23/06/23, 18:57 - Ananya: You will be sharing the mantra every day to mark your attendance and when you won't be having your sessions on Monday and Thursday, you will be receiving a task or interesting story to learn from.
23/06/23, 18:57 - Ananya: And on Wednesdays I will also share the lesson with you so come around 12PM to receive the lesson
Similarly, I will share the Saturday Activity on Saturday so come over around 12PM to receive the same.
23/06/23, 18:57 - Ananya: So from now on it is very important for you to be active in the sessions at the designated times shared with you as it will be a factor to consider your attendance and ultimately for the Edoofa Grant too.

Keep a note on the time table as we strictly connect only at 12-2PM just twice a week, and the rest of the days, you have to share the mantra to mark your attendance before 12PM
23/06/23, 18:57 - Ananya: I hope you understand the time schedules that I have explained, if you have any queries, you can ask now as we will be strictly following the timelines.
23/06/23, 18:57 - Ananya: Hello Edoofian,
We hope this message finds you well in your academic pursuits. We are excited to share a Saturday activity centered around learning from influential personalities. Our chosen figure is Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of Liberia and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Through her remarkable leadership and unwavering determination, she has left an indelible mark on history. Let's draw valuable lessons from her life for our personal development.

Two traits that stand out about Ellen Johnson Sirleaf are resilience and visionary leadership. These qualities can greatly contribute to our growth and development as individuals. They can positively impact our academic pursuits, relationships, and future career goals.

To develop resilience, we can learn from Sirleaf's ability to bounce back from challenges. We can seek out difficult experiences and learn from them, cultivating a mindset of perseverance and adaptability.

Here are some suggestions to help you get started:

Identify two traits: Reflect on Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's qualities that resonate with you.

Reflect on personal development: Consider how these traits can positively impact your academic pursuits, relationships, or future career goals.

Create an action plan: Outline practical steps like seeking mentorship, practicing self-discipline, engaging in community service, or pursuing relevant courses and extracurricular activities.
Let's embark on this exciting journey together and make Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's legacy an integral part of our own lives.
Best regards,

Team Edoofa

Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!

18/07/23, 18:25 - Raymond EWYL22E1330: Strive Masiyiwa 

He was born in Zimbabwe and got elevated to his high school and upper level education in the United Kingdom. Based on his upbringing he got his inspiration of business from his mother who was an entrepreneur.

My inborn intuition is based on the narrative that the world and global village is based on the communal understanding of the people. My take is allied with balancing the needs and wants of the societal requirements as we see fit by the prevailing factors of the economical needs. Us as a community can never strive without a perpetual input and discovery of the means and digital world to enhance our strength.

In his humble beginning he created an empire in the communication space that saves the masses and created jobs. He also navigated his skills and entrepreneurship across the global village.

To state the accomplishments he's been a board memberships over the years include: Unilever (board member) Netflix(board member), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (trustee), The national Geographic Society(trustee), Bank of America (Global Advisor Council), UN commission on Adaptation (former Commissioner), Generation Africa (co-founder), Pathways for Prosperity Commission on Technology and Inclusive and so many more which I can elaborate further.

The true value of us extends beyond our limitations from the scope of my view point. So it necessary to forge and navigate in the undiscovered territories of our given space. The land we have from agricultural, mining and technology. 

Our generation needs to impact our communities in job creation through utilizing the given resources such as land and education that is at our disposal to start. There after skills acquired and experience will grow in line with continuous improvement of our projects.

In conclusion nothing is impossible all we need is to pursue our passion and tape into our gifts to improve further and futuristic needs of our community. Learning from the predecessors and advanced economics will also add a step ahead. In our history as Africans we have learnt that raw materials across all industries is abundant and we lack less other than the skills and knowledge to process the outcome.

21/07/23, 13:51 - Raymond EWYL22E1330: Okay sir
21/07/23, 13:54 - Ananya: Yes I am waiting
21/07/23, 14:28 - Raymond EWYL22E1330: *I understand what is meant by the term leadership* Leadership is the ability of an individual to motivate,influence, and enable other employees to make a contribution to the success of an organization 

I also understood that in order to be an influential student leader in your community requires dedication, passion, and a commitment to making a positive impact and there are strategies to follow which are such as Lead by example. Leading by example is a leadership style where you model the behavior you want to see in your team members. When you lead by example, you don't just push team members towards excellence-rather, you actively demonstrate that excellence.

There’s also building relationship therefore Giving effective feedback and avoiding common mistakes in giving feedback is one of the best ways leaders can improve their relationship skills. Feedback lets people know how they're doing, reinforces goals, and encourages strong effort.moreover the question might be like :
How can leaders build positive relationships?
Use empathy to connect more authentically with others.

Moreover there’s also effectively communication whereby Listen and encourage input. Let team members know they are valuable, show empathy toward them, and create psychological safety so people feel comfortable speaking up. It will show those you lead that you care about both them and the organization. Also, be okay with silence.

More and more Leadership Essentials: Taking Initiative Successful leaders do not wait for someone to tell them what to do. They think on their feet and take appropriate action, are proactive rather than reactive, and appear flexible, confident and courageous.

Also understand that leaders should empower others meaning to say Leaders who empower others understand that a vision is rarely achieved by just one person but by a team. Empowering leadership involves placing trust and confidence in staff members. Therefore, empowering leadership makes space for individuals to share creative ideas and also works to implement these when possible.

To embrace diversity, leaders must pay attention to how all people are treated in any work environment, and focus on increasing fairness. Leaders must be intentional to engage and acknowledge each person and their value through verbal and nonverbal microaffirmations.
Question might say Why is it important for leaders to embrace diversity and inclusion? :In addition to fostering innovation, diversity also helps create a more inclusive and welcoming work culture. This can lead to higher levels of employee engagement and retention, as employees feel valued and supported within their organization.

Furthermore leaders should serve community whereby the role of a community leader is not to fix all the community's problems but rather to work together with the community members. Community leaders mobilize and guide others, facilitate the problem-solving and decision-making processes, and innovate to benefit the community itself.

Last but not least there’s continuously learn and grow as a leader that is why continuous learning is crucial for leadership success. By prioritizing ongoing growth and development, leaders can improve their problem-solving and decision-making skills, inspire others, and create a culture of innovation within their organization.
