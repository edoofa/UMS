20/12/22, 04:01 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Im a proud Edoofian
20/12/22, 04:02 - Tenzin: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
20/12/22, 04:04 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Okay
20/12/22, 14:02 - Tenzin: Greetings, Proud Edoofian

04/01/23, 23:01 - Tenzin: *Wednesday Lesson | 4 Jan*

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy learning.
04/01/23, 23:02 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Ooooh oky

05/01/23, 21:53 - Tenzin: Edoofian, Punctuality in school life builds the path to success in a student's life by enabling them to plan ahead, making an efficient routine, and be prepared for their tasks. A punctual student is better equipped to deal with their day-to-day tasks than a person who leaves it for the last moment.Please note that we would only be able to earn the desired amount of credits if we are punctual at our session timings.
Before, We start with our next session, I would like you to specify the reason for your absence from Today's session by writing a letter to Ms Deepali, our Head of Department in the EWYL Group
Have a cheerful day ahead
05/01/23, 22:25 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Yes

05/01/23, 22:35 - Tenzin: I understand, Alson
Please make sure that you write the letter to Ms. Deepali in the EWYL Group Today
05/01/23, 22:37 - Alson EWYL22E0675: A letter about what sir

06/01/23, 18:16 - Tenzin: I hope that you have shared the letter with Ms Deepali in the EWYL Group?
10/01/23, 01:37 - Alson EWYL22E0675: This Edoofian is active now
10/01/23, 18:15 - Tenzin: Greetings, Alson

10/01/23, 18:16 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Am good
10/01/23, 18:16 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Okay
10/01/23, 18:21 - Tenzin: Edoofian, Due to a technical error, I was not able to share the Saturday Activity with you. Therefore, I am sharing it below:
I hope that you are aware that the deadline to share the response is 5 mins prior to our session timings but since the activity got delayed therefore, You can share it with me by Tomorrow.
10/01/23, 18:21 - Tenzin: \"Sell me this pen.\" That might just be the best sales one-liner in history.

Over the last 10 years, I've seen many sales leaders use this question as part of their interview process to whittle out the \"can-dos\" from the \"can-nots.\" 

It's a favorite amongst sales professionals, from used car salespeople to Wall Street wolves. And for good reason — it's an exciting, accessible way to test a salesperson's fundamentals. How someone responds to those four words can tell you a lot about how — and how well — a candidate is going to perform in his\/her job. 

Let's try to respond to this prominent question as part of your Saturday submission. Your response must be shared in at least 150 words. The submission deadline for the same is DATE.

I'm anticipating a highly original and creative response from your end.
10/01/23, 18:22 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Okay
10/01/23, 18:23 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Okay
10/01/23, 18:28 - Tenzin: I would love to share a recent achievement of *Panashe Rueben Chimedza*, a proud Edoofian from Zimbabwe who made it to the University Basketball team of one of the prestigious institutions in India and won titles. 
The magnitude of this achievement is understood when you realize the only gold medalist for India in the previous Olympics is a student of this University thus the University gives great importance to extracurriculars.
10/01/23, 19:11 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Woooow
10/01/23, 19:13 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Nice
10/01/23, 19:16 - Tenzin: I am glad that we started our session on such a positive note.
Now, Should we move ahead?
10/01/23, 19:17 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Absolutely
10/01/23, 19:20 - Tenzin: Edoofian, For the period of next 10 days, I would want you to choose from the projects mentioned below:

1. Community Building
2. African School Education Reform Mission Project
3. Corporate Alliance Project
10/01/23, 19:58 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Okay
10/01/23, 20:19 - Tenzin: So, What is your choice, Alson?
10/01/23, 20:27 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Community building
10/01/23, 20:38 - Tenzin: Great!
I would like to select one more project that you will be working on along with the Community Building Project
10/01/23, 20:40 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Okay
10/01/23, 21:34 - Tenzin: So, Which project have you selected?
10/01/23, 21:51 - Alson EWYL22E0675: African School education reform
10/01/23, 22:03 - Tenzin: Great!
Now, I would want you to setup a target for yourself based on these projects and we will together work to accomplish that.
10/01/23, 22:33 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Okay
10/01/23, 22:41 - Tenzin: So, What is the target, Alson?
10/01/23, 23:19 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Convincing atleast 25 people to join the edoofa community
10/01/23, 23:23 - Tenzin: Alson, That's Great!
And Target for the African School education reform Mission Project?
10/01/23, 23:24 - Alson EWYL22E0675: To interact with at most 10 school
11/01/23, 18:36 - Tenzin: Greetings, Alson
How are you?
11/01/23, 18:37 - Tenzin: I apologize for not getting back to you.
I missed your message by mistake.
11/01/23, 18:37 - Tenzin: Edoofian, You have not submitted the Saturday Activity and Wednesday Lesson response yet.
Please let me know if you are facing any challenges.
11/01/23, 18:39 - Tenzin: Also, Let us try completing our Yesterday's session Today.

May I know when are you planning to start working on this project?
11/01/23, 21:18 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Yeah
11/01/23, 21:18 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Anytime sir when l get free from my school work
11/01/23, 21:57 - Tenzin: That means Today, right?
11/01/23, 21:57 - Tenzin: May I know if you are aware of what messages should we send to the school heads?
11/01/23, 22:58 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Noo
11/01/23, 23:03 - Tenzin: Let me help you with that
11/01/23, 23:03 - Tenzin: Once you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering professional communication, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
11/01/23, 23:03 - Tenzin: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
11/01/23, 23:35 - Alson EWYL22E0675: Okay sir
12/01/23, 06:18 - Tenzin: Alson, Let us continue from here in our session tomorrow.
12/01/23, 06:18 - Tenzin: Wednesday Lesson

Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals towards achieving this goal. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

I would appreciate you sharing your learnings from today’s lesson.
