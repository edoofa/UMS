16/03/23, 22:30 - KUDAKWASHE EWYL22E1307: Creating wealth is more beneficial as wealth doesn't only serve you now but also in the future .looking out money is not much important as compared to seeking wealth as money is only a medium of exchange and store of value there fore i desire to  have wealth rather than money because money on its own doesn't appreciate but wealth does
16/03/23, 22:39 - KUDAKWASHE EWYL22E1307: More so money and status are signs of wealth ,so the lesson  that I leant is that as a proud Edoofian i should target wealth as it is the key to success

20/03/23, 17:42 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my proud Edoofian!

The Wednesday Wisdom encouraged us to seek wealth, not just money or status, here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring, and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!","transform":"

20/03/23, 18:10 - Aditi Kapoor: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

23/03/23, 23:09 - KUDAKWASHE EWYL22E1307: The session has imparted me with a positive perception on wealth .wealth is regarded as a tool which can be used either for the good or bad there fore the responsibility is in the hands of the individual either to use it in a good way or the opposite .taking for an example given ,if one creates a company which makes and sell products, this will be to a greater extent beneficial to third parties eg the up lifting of standards and boosting the economy which I my self see as a good thing when creating wealth
23/03/23, 23:22 - Aditi Kapoor: I'm glad to hear that the session helped shape your perception on wealth in a positive way. It is true that wealth can be a powerful tool that can be used for both good and bad purposes, and it ultimately depends on the individual's values and priorities in life.
23/03/23, 23:22 - Aditi Kapoor: Creating a company that produces and sells products can indeed have a positive impact on the economy and society as a whole, especially if the products are of high quality and meet the needs of consumers. This can lead to increased job opportunities, higher standards of living, and the overall growth of the economy.
23/03/23, 23:22 - Aditi Kapoor: However, it is also important to note that with great power comes great responsibility. As individuals accumulate wealth, they have a responsibility to use it in a way that benefits not only themselves but also the people and communities around them. This can be done through charitable giving, supporting local businesses, and investing in socially responsible projects.
23/03/23, 23:22 - Aditi Kapoor: Overall, wealth can be a force for good in the world, but it is up to each of us to use it wisely and responsibly.
