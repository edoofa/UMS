13/07/22, 16:38 - Tenzin: Rukudzo, In the past few days, I have observed that we have started to deviate from the goals that we wanted to achieve when we started our EWYL Program.
The only reason for this is the lack of connectivity.
13/07/22, 16:39 - Tenzin: Let us have a discussion today and try to find out a solution for this.
13/07/22, 21:50 - Rukudzo EWYL21E0593: Yes sir thank you

16/07/22, 17:56 - Tenzin: Good Morning, Proud Edoofian ?

We will be continuing with where we left in our scheduled session next week.
I wanted to inform you that I won't be active on the EWYL DEDICATED LINE this weekend. I have dedicated this weekend to the Edoofians who are in India. I will be getting on calls with them and checking how everything is going.

I would want you to follow the points given below:
◼️Make sure that you follow the Proud Edoofian ritual (Even on Sunday?)
◼️Keep an eye on the Saturday Activity that will be shared in your batch group
◼️Also, If you haven't submitted the Wednesday Lesson yet, Please make sure that you submit it as soon as possible.
◼️I would like to you work diligently on the EWYL Projects and submit your Project Progress Form in our next scheduled session.

I wish you a blessed and a joyful weekend ahead✨
16/07/22, 20:28 - Rukudzo EWYL21E0593: Noted thank you
25/07/22, 03:16 - Tenzin: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:08 - Tenzin: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

Here’s a quote to pump up your motivation:
_Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. – Stephen Hawking_

We will be discussing about your pending submissions if any, so, please make sure everything is complete

16/12/22, 00:20 - Tenzin: Rukudzo, You must have realised that I haven't shared the Report Card with you that was supposed to be shared along with the Saturday Activity

I am sharing the Report Card with you below. Please have a look at it carefully. We will be having our conversation on this in detail in our next session, okay?
16/12/22, 00:40 - Rukudzo EWYL21E0593: Sir

16/12/22, 22:37 - Rukudzo EWYL21E0593: Greetings sir
17/12/22, 21:42 - Tenzin: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, 
_I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?_

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!
