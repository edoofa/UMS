13/12/22, 19:23 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

17/12/22, 21:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, 
_I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?_

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

04/01/23, 23:41 - Saloni Rastogi: *Wednesday Lesson | 4 Jan*

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy learning.

06/01/23, 00:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Edoofian, Punctuality in school life builds the path to success in a student's life by enabling them to plan ahead, make an efficient routine, and be prepared for their tasks. A punctual student is better equipped to deal with their day-to-day tasks than a person who leaves it for the last moment. Please note that we would only be able to earn the desired amount of credits if we are punctual at our session timings.

09/01/23, 22:59 - Ropafadzo EWYL22E0737: from the set of skills i learnt how these 6 principles can help me archieve what i want through persuasion.it can be either through reciprocity,scarcity,authority,commitment and consistency,liking and consesus.

Through reciprocity i can be able to gain favours from people by doing unexpected favours for them and also by helping them.I will be able to do some of my projects easily if i am able to use this principle.


i can also use scarcity to gain interest of my products from people by reducing its availability

authourity can also help me with my projects as i am able to reach out to big companies if i talk to the right people who are able to influence the people they work with.
 
commitment and consistency also helps because if i am able to convince someone to do something simple they can also be influenced to do something greater



liking is also one of the greatest advantages of persuasion because if people like me and my charactee they can listen to me and help me when necessary therefore been liked by many will help me with some of the projects


Consensus is also easy to use if only managing my reputation and personal brand.
09/01/23, 23:09 - Saloni Rastogi: Great work, Ropafadzo!

1. Saturday Activity

If you have not received the Saturday Activity, I am sharing it below again:
You can consider the deadline to be extended by 1 day i.e. Tuesday 5 mins prior to our session timings.

Sat activity: 

Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

A college student named Rachel was unsure of what career path to pursue after graduation. She talked to several professionals in different fields, but none of them seemed to fit her interests and skills. One day, she had a conversation with a mentor who asked her the right questions, such as \"What are you passionate about?\" and \"What do you enjoy doing in your free time?\" Rachel realized that her true passion was writing and storytelling. She decided to pursue a career in journalism and landed a job at a top news outlet.

We gained knowledge on how to ask intelligent questions. I'd like you to share with us any two questions you'd like to ask yourself as part of your Saturday submission. The questions that you may have been hesitant to make, the questions that put you in a difficult situation, the inquiries that will have a significant impact on your career and future. For example:  1. What is the limit of my current capabilities and how can I push beyond them to continue learning and growing?\"
2. “How can I ensure that my actions align with my values and contribute to the greater good, rather than just maximizing my own success?\"

Looking forward to your response!
