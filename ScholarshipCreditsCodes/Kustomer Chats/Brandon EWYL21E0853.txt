13/07/22, 00:22 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

It was an interesting one and related to the EWYL projects and really fascinated me.
14/07/22, 01:45 - Unknown: Please share the response on the activity Brandon. 
Please acknowledge this message.
14/07/22, 17:46 - Unknown: Hello Brandon!

15/07/22, 00:33 - Unknown: You missed your last activity Brandon, Did you work on the Wednesday wisdom task I shared with you yesterday Edoofian?

Personally I found it very interesting as it discussed the life and struggles of Patrice, an African Billionaire and I believe my students should take inspiration from him.
15/07/22, 01:00 - Brandon EWYL21E0853: Yes i did ,l too found awe-inspiring the way Patrick Motsepe ,a black South African raised by a teacher became one of the most influential people in the country
15/07/22, 01:37 - Unknown: Amazing work on the Lesson task. I saw that Patrice had the wisdom to recognize and grab the opportunities that time brought for him and that is what set him apart from others and made him who he is.

Do you agree on this Brandon?
15/07/22, 04:24 - Brandon EWYL21E0853: Yes. I very much agree
15/07/22, 19:58 - Unknown: Hello Edoofian, Greetings of the day.

Please send your \"Proud Edoofian\" message for the day.
15/07/22, 19:58 - Unknown: Now Brandon recognizing and grabbing the opportunities that come at hand is crucial. Do you believe you do that as well?

19/07/22, 22:17 - Unknown: Hi Brandon, how are you doing?
19/07/22, 22:17 - Unknown: Did you work on the  very interesting Weekend activity? 

I personally enjoyed learning about SWOT analysis and implementing it for my self. I hope you did too. Please share the response with me.
20/07/22, 17:42 - Unknown: Hello Brandon, how are you doing?
20/07/22, 17:42 - Unknown: Did you read my messages?
25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

I personally found it very interesting as I know my students struggle with managing their time to attend university and to work on their skill building and that is why I requested Mrs Davi to create a lesson on the same.

11/08/22, 22:06 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off

13/10/22, 01:22 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.
