23/12/23, 20:28 - Prosper EWYL23E0696: Alright, no problem
24/12/23, 22:44 - Prosper EWYL23E0696: In Zimbabwe, for many people, Christmas day starts with a special church service, and the children, dressed in their best clothes, sing the songs that they have practised for this special day. After church, the whole family gather together to start a celebration and feast. Traditional Christmas food in Zimbabwe Chicken, while quite pricey these days, is especially savoured during Christmas in Zimbabwe. Naturally, there are a number of ways to enjoy chicken, but it is often the stew, curry, and oven-roast recipes that take the cake.As for me, I recommend family Christmas traditions so strongly because family traditions bond us closer together; they help  kids feel a sense of belonging; they create memories that will last a lifetime; they give us something to look forward to and they can help shape the character of everyone, especially the children.

Exactly, now coming to project discussion.Could you provide an update on the Community Building project? What progress have you made?
02/01/24, 14:38 - Unknown: Now that the session time is over we are wrapping up today's session. Looking forward to a more productive, full of learning and engaging session.
02/01/24, 14:47 - Prosper EWYL23E0696: As for me ,  last year had so much  to learn .From when it started , when l wrote the first term exams l did very well in two of my subjects and only got a point in Mathematics. This wasn't because I didn't practice well but because l made a lot of mistakes which reduced the my mark.After we were given the papers for that test , l went to see the Maths teacher .All l wanted was to be given a solution on what l have to do to minimize those silly mistakes.Since the teacher realized my effort, instead of telling me that I did it wrong , he told me that l was very close to the right answers and that l must keep on trying, .I then realized that l have to learn from that mistake. When we wrote the mid year exams , l also failed Maths exam but l had little mistakes on my working .All l knew was that l had to trust the process so that when all mistakes are dealt with , it will be definitely not probably.I  had to first find out the problem , which were the mistakes l made , so that l will do something to correct it and all will be fine.When the final Maths exam came , l knew that l have to go through all my work so that mistakes are minimized and that l did.Same thing applies in our lives , when we fail in what we do ,it's not because we can't do that thing , it's only that we have to find out the problem so that it   won't reduce our performance and always trust the process .
02/01/24, 14:49 - Prosper EWYL23E0696: I have not yet started , planning to start working on it this January
02/01/24, 14:49 - Prosper EWYL23E0696: Yes , that's true
03/01/24, 13:27 - Unknown: Good Morning Prosper
I hope you are doing well

Your reflections on last year's challenges, particularly in math exams,  demonstrate a resilient mindset. Recognizing mistakes, understanding  their root causes, and actively working to minimize them is a valuable  approach to both academics and life. Your analogy beautifully captures  the essence of learning from setbacks, trusting the process, and  persisting towards success. Wishing you continued growth and success in  the year ahead!
03/01/24, 19:13 - Prosper EWYL23E0696: Thank you so much , l am super grateful for your kind words

16/01/24, 13:30 - Prosper EWYL23E0696: The problem is most of the students l know , they already know the Edoofa Scholarship program so l have to reach out to other new students maybe from other schools , if they have not yet heard about it
16/01/24, 13:46 - Prosper EWYL23E0696: Also , have you heard the 'A' level results l have been waiting for are out
16/01/24, 14:21 - Unknown: It's understandable that reaching out to students who are already aware of the Edoofa Scholarship program might present challenges. Expanding your outreach to new students from different schools is a great strategy. Here are some suggestions to help you in this endeavor:
Explore New Channels:Consider using a variety of communication channels to reach students from other schools, such as social media platforms, community events, or collaboration with educational institutions.

Utilize Peer Networks:Leverage the power of word-of-mouth. Encourage current participants or those who are familiar with the Edoofa program to spread the word among their peers in different schools.

Host Information Sessions:Organize sessions or workshops specifically for students from different schools. This can provide them with a direct opportunity to learn more about the program and address any questions they may have.
16/01/24, 14:23 - Unknown: And yes, I am aware about the A level results being out and I am so happy to know that most of my students have been able to pass with flying colours.
