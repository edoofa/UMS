23/03/23, 21:18 - Praise EWYL22E1028: I learned to seek wealth, not money or status .Seeking wealth can provide a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial stability and success .On the other hand money is a tool we use to transfer time and wealth.It is important to recognize that true happiness comes from the inside not from external validation.

27/03/23, 20:44 - Aditi Kapoor: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

27/03/23, 21:06 - Praise EWYL22E1028: I was told that i must report here on Monday and Thursday at 11.30
27/03/23, 21:11 - Aditi Kapoor: I think there is some confusion dear. You have to come to the EWYL Line every day and say that *I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN*. 
By this, we keep the track of the students who are participating in our sessions and activities. 
Most of the information is given to only those students who are coming to the EWYL LIne every day. 

I will share your activity now but make sure to come here every day.
27/03/23, 21:13 - Aditi Kapoor: I am pleased to observe that a majority of you comprehended well, the message  that was conveyed in this week's Wednesday wisdom. It brought me great joy to go through student’s perspectives on wealth creation and the mindset essential for embarking on this path.

I have a special Saturday assignment for you. The objective of this assignment is to help you understand the steps you can take to prepare yourself for wealth creation. The assignment will encourage you to identify their goals, develop a financial plan, and cultivate the mindset and habits needed to achieve financial success.

Here are some instructions to make it easy for you to work on this assignment:
1. Goal Setting: The first step towards wealth creation is to set clear and achievable goals. In this section, write down your short-term and long-term financial goals. Explain how each goal will contribute to your overall financial success.
2. Financial Planning: A financial plan is a roadmap that outlines how you will achieve your financial goals. In this section, develop a comprehensive financial plan that includes strategies for budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management. Identify the resources you will need to achieve your financial plan and explain how you will access them.
3. Mindset and Habits: Wealth creation is not just about having a financial plan; it is also about cultivating the mindset and habits that will help you achieve your goals. In this section, identify the mindset and habits that are necessary for financial success. Explain how you will cultivate these qualities in yourself and develop strategies to overcome any obstacles that may arise.
4. Conclusion: In this section, summarize your findings and discuss the importance of preparing yourself for wealth creation. Reflect on what you have learned throughout the assignment and discuss how you will apply these principles in your own life.

You are required to submit this assignment before your next scheduled 
27/03/23, 21:16 - Praise EWYL22E1028: Okay thank you
27/03/23, 21:19 - Aditi Kapoor: I request you to take 30 minutes and complete your pending activity.
27/03/23, 22:14 - Aditi Kapoor: Have you completed your activity?
27/03/23, 22:29 - Praise EWYL22E1028: Almost done
27/03/23, 23:21 - Praise EWYL22E1028: My short term financial goals are setting a budget ,reducing debt and starting  an emergency fund and as for my long term financial goals i want to save some money to help my parents pay my fees ,I'll do that by doing part time jobs. 
2, The resources i need to achieve my financial plan are budgeting  ,saving and categorizing objectives into short term ,medium term and long term financial goals as it helps me to focus on the plan.
3,The habbits  and mindset that are necessary for financial success are create and stick to the plan ,analysing your spending, saving and investing regularly .I plan on developing strategies to overcome any obstacles that may arise by reinforcing a positive outlook, thinking logically ,generating possible solutions and asking for help. 
4,Wealth creation is important because it ensures a financial liquidity, reduces financial crunch and promotes independency. I have learned that a financial plan acts as a guide as you go through life's journey, it helps you to be in control of your income, expenses and investments such that you can manage your money and achieve your goals.
28/03/23, 01:35 - Aditi Kapoor: Well done Praise. I am very impressed dear

In order to ensure that you are able to move forward with the new lessons, I want to remind you that you must complete all of your previous assignments by the end of this week.

It is essential that you take the time to thoroughly review and complete your previous assignments.

I hope this message finds you well. 

\"Consistency is the foundation of achievement. Stay consistent in your actions, and you will achieve your goals.\"

As we discussed in Wednesday's lesson, consistency is key to achieving your goals. In order to assess your understanding of this topic, I am requesting that you submit a brief write-up on what you learned from the lesson and your discussions with your mentors, how you plan to apply it to your daily routine. Please submit your responses before your next Scheduled Session.

Also I want you to write a heartfelt message to your mentors, discussing the obstacles you are encountering that are preventing you from maintaining consistency in your sessions and EWYL submissions.

Remember, consistency is not just about doing something once, but about making a habit of it. So, let's work together to build consistent study habits and achieve success!
08/04/23, 20:03 - Praise EWYL22E1028: What i learned from the Wednesday lesson is that consistency is key and success isn't always about greatness but consistency .Consistency in studies is crucial for a student's academic success .Consistent practice ensures that the skills are ingrained in the students memory .Consistency also help students to have a clear understanding of concepts .

20/04/23, 15:09 - Praise EWYL22E1028: The main cause of environmental problems in my community are people who are polluting the land and cutting down trees which leads to  deforestation and eventually causes land degradation. Those industries that realise toxic chemicals in water and those that destroy trees for infrastructure development end up killing animals and destroying their habitat. The government should heavily fine those that pollute the land and also encourage citizens to have a clean up campaign.
