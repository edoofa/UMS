21/07/23, 15:45 - Ananya: Please share your lesson.
21/07/23, 16:05 - Pritchard EWYL23E0321: I did go through the document, it said about Student Leaders who emerge as informal leaders demonstrating leadership qualities and influencing other peers through their actions and involvement in various activities and initiatives. 

It mentioned some keys strategies to help us become an influential student leader, some of  the key actions to follow are, 
You need to :
1. Lead by example--- An individual need to be a role model by demonstrating the qualities you wish to see in others. 
2. Build relationship---By building positive relationships you gain respect and trust , which enhances your influence as a student leader.
3. Embrace Diversity and Inclusion-----You need to respect and embrace the diversity of your community, fostering an environment where everyone feels valued  and included and also encourage collaboration. 
4. You need to empower others  inorder to reach their full potential. Inorder to satisfy the qualities of being a student leader, you should also communicate effectively. You need to hone your communication skills by expressing your ideas clearly,  and listen  attentively.
21/07/23, 16:10 - Ananya: Your summary beautifully captures the essential qualities and strategies for effective leadership:

Student leaders indeed emerge as informal leaders who lead by example and influence their peers through their actions, attitudes, and active involvement in various activities and initiatives.
21/07/23, 16:13 - Pritchard EWYL23E0321: I understand

21/07/23, 19:40 - Ananya: I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to inform you that this week's Saturday activity details will be shared with you today instead of the usual schedule.

25/07/23, 15:49 - Pritchard EWYL23E0321: I managed to share a  conversation with 2 school heads ...I think i have less than 2 days to have them share their details that is for my school project.  
 
For  community building ..there's poor connection right now with the students because almost all of the them are not allowed to  operate cell phones during school days,  so I'm waiting for the closing day which is next week, I will be able to connect with them and do the same.
25/07/23, 15:53 - Ananya: Pritchard, May I know if you have students near your area?
25/07/23, 15:55 - Pritchard EWYL23E0321: Yes, I have students.
25/07/23, 15:56 - Ananya: May I know if you have reach out to them personally?
25/07/23, 15:59 - Pritchard EWYL23E0321: I'm doing the same thing..but the biggest disappointment with me is that most of them get admissions into local universities. 

The other part is doing their final year .
25/07/23, 16:04 - Ananya: By final year you mean level 6?
25/07/23, 16:04 - Pritchard EWYL23E0321: Yes ma'am.
25/07/23, 16:05 - Ananya: So then why arent they applying?
25/07/23, 16:07 - Pritchard EWYL23E0321: They are at school right now ...so students aren't allowed to use cell phones while at school. They only do that once they are home nxt week.
25/07/23, 16:10 - Ananya: Yes, That is why I am asking you is you can visit their home physically. I have students who are doing that too.
25/07/23, 16:11 - Pritchard EWYL23E0321: Okay it's fine ..I can do that too
25/07/23, 16:14 - Ananya: Is there anything else you would like to share or ask?
25/07/23, 16:16 - Pritchard EWYL23E0321: No, I'm fine.

30/07/23, 16:35 - Pritchard EWYL23E0321: 1. Celebrity endorsement, also known as celebrity branding  is a marketing strategy that uses a celebrity's fame and image  to promote a brand or product or to raise awareness about an issue. 
Marketers use celebrity endorsers in hopes that the positive image of the celebrity endorser will be passed on to the product's or brand's image.
Non - profit organizations also  use celebrities since a celebrity's frequent mass media coverage reaches a wider audience thus making celebrities an effective ingredient in fundraising. 
Celebrity marketing is also very effective to mark a major change for a brand, like the introduction of new product,  market expansion or brand repositioning. Celebrity branding can also be a powerful strategy to differentiate yourself from your competitors and get the edge in a highly competitive market. 
There are many different ways celebrities can endorse your brand or product i.e through:
 Celebrity ads and  commercials , celebrity appearances in live events,  celebrity signature product lines and celebrity spokesperson.  To further enhance a brand's image, an organization or company has to  collaborate  with popular celebrities from various domains including music , sports and entertainment and use them as brand ambassadors . This association increases a brand's visibility and credibility  amoung its target audience.
