On the negative side  I am facing challenges of having few few students who graduated for their senior secondary education because most of them who graduated in 2022 have already gone to tertiary level and I'm exploring to have high numbers from the    2023 students who are still waiting for their results.

27/12/23, 13:01 - Unknown: Good Morning Tinotenda
I hope you are doing well

As we embark on today's session, let me share a motivational thought: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill. This quote reminds us that every step, be it a triumph or a stumble, is part of our journey.

Now, tell me, how did you celebrate Christmas? I believe celebrations are not just about the festive season but also moments of personal victories and joy. How are you doing, and is there anything you'd like to share about your experiences during the holiday season? Let's explore the path ahead together.
27/12/23, 13:12 - Tinotenda EWYL23E0989: I had a good time  with my family. It's unfortunate we had heavy rains so we could  not go out  as we had planned. Regardless of the bad weather we really had good time as a  family. I really enjoyed sharing the experience and how this year was flowing with my brothers and sister since it has been a while without seeing each other.
27/12/23, 13:15 - Unknown: It sounds like despite the unexpected heavy rains, you had a wonderful  time with your family! It's always special when you can share  experiences and catch up with loved ones, especially when there has been  some time apart. Cherishing those moments together, regardless of the  weather, adds to the warmth of family bonds. I'm glad to hear that you  enjoyed the time with your brothers and sisters.
27/12/23, 13:17 - Tinotenda EWYL23E0989: Yes we had a wonderful time ma'am.
27/12/23, 13:18 - Unknown: Great Tinotenda. 
Let's now delve into the heart of two impactful projects - Community Building and African School Reform. These projects are more than just tasks; they're avenues for growth, connection, and positive change. I'm here to guide you through, providing not just information but also the motivation to fuel your efforts. So, let's dive in. üöÄ
27/12/23, 13:19 - Tinotenda EWYL23E0989: Ok ma'am thank you.
27/12/23, 13:24 - Unknown: You are welcome please.
27/12/23, 13:24 - Unknown: Imagine our community as a vibrant ecosystem where connections flourish, relationships bloom, and shared identities thrive. The goal is simple but profound‚Äîto foster a positive and cohesive community. As part of Team EDOOFA, you have a unique opportunity to develop networking and persuasion skills. Your task? Reach out to African students, tapping into your personal and extended networks. Identify motivated youths seeking a path to great careers and guide them towards the transformative Edoofa program.
27/12/23, 13:28 - Tinotenda EWYL23E0989: Ok ma'am.
27/12/23, 13:33 - Unknown: Ways to Approach:
So, how can you do this? Utilize your networks‚Äîboth personal and extended. Leverage the power of social media to spread the word about Edoofa's educational ecosystem. Share openly and highlight the impact it can have on aspiring students. Remember, this isn't just about recruitment; it's about creating meaningful opportunities for others. Let's brainstorm together on the most effective ways to make these connections. What platforms resonate with you, and how can you authentically convey the benefits of Edoofa?
27/12/23, 13:34 - Unknown: Thank you for submitting the student application form, I have taken a note of the same.
27/12/23, 13:35 - Unknown: what are your thoughts on the ways to approach, Tinotenda?
27/12/23, 13:37 - Tinotenda EWYL23E0989: Okay  ma'am.
27/12/23, 13:40 - Tinotenda EWYL23E0989: For now I have been using WhatsApp as social platform to reach the students. I have been  trying to explain and making it clear the benefits of Edoofa program and how they are   helping African students to have access to high level education. I have been also using some of the information you provided for me before.
27/12/23, 13:42 - Unknown: Great Going Tinotenda. I hope you are definitely having a good time working on the projects.
