28/06/23, 12:58 - Gervais EWYL22E1186: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Gervais and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Gervais EWYL22E1186
28/06/23, 13:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Gervais!
How are you?
28/06/23, 13:04 - Gervais EWYL22E1186: Am good and how are you
28/06/23, 13:05 - Saloni Rastogi: I am doing well, thank you.
28/06/23, 13:05 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
28/06/23, 13:05 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
28/06/23, 13:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *12:00-01:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
28/06/23, 13:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready?
28/06/23, 13:09 - Gervais EWYL22E1186: Yes am ready
28/06/23, 16:28 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

Tell us if these were helpful for you in the comments below!
01/07/23, 15:54 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!

07/07/23, 16:41 - Gervais EWYL22E1186: Good consistency will make someone ahead of others in terms of preparing for  somethings whether it's work staff of personal staff and when people observe the good consistency it will make them trust you with alot things since you can deliver on your promises and displaying wonderful behaviours 
The consistency will also help one to maintain good habits like good health habit since a person Is Able to stick to a plan which they made and since someone is able to stick to a plan they are also more motivated so that they can achieve wat they want
07/07/23, 16:42 - Gervais EWYL22E1186: I have submitted 3 application forms and am still waiting.for the principal of saint John's to answer me
07/07/23, 17:13 - Saloni Rastogi: I appreciate your kind words and I'm glad you found my response motivating. Consistency truly is a key factor in achieving success, whether it's in work, personal life, or maintaining good habits.
When you consistently show up and deliver on your promises, it builds trust with others. People appreciate reliability and knowing they can count on you. By consistently displaying positive behaviors, you create a positive reputation and inspire those around you.
07/07/23, 17:13 - Saloni Rastogi: Furthermore, consistency helps in developing and maintaining good habits, including those related to health. When you stick to a plan and remain consistent with your actions, you are more likely to achieve your desired outcomes. This consistency breeds motivation and fuels your drive to attain what you want.
07/07/23, 17:13 - Saloni Rastogi: Gervais, I am sharing a very valuable resource with you that you can share with the Headmasters and students and attract all of them. It is irresistible to connect with Edoofa after seeing that video.

07/07/23, 17:35 - Saloni Rastogi: I would like to end the session here by saying that:

"Transformation begins with the courage to step outside your comfort zone and embrace the unknown. '

This means that we need to embrace the beauty of transformation and let it guide us to new heights and you definitely know that we can dare to dream, dare to transform. The possibilities are endless when you believe in yourself.
