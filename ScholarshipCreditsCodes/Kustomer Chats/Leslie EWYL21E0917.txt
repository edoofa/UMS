How are you?
11/01/23, 03:30 - Leslie EWYL21E0917: 1.*What methods can a woman use to remove facial hair?* 
There are several methods a woman can use to remove unwanted facial hair, including:

Shaving: This is a quick and easy method, but it can cause irritation and ingrown hairs.

Waxing: This method involves using warm wax to remove hair from the root. It can be painful and may cause redness and irritation, but it typically lasts longer than shaving.

Tweezing: This is a good option for removing individual hairs, but it can be time-consuming and painful.

Depilatory creams: These creams use chemicals to dissolve the hair, allowing it to be easily wiped away. They can cause irritation, but they are easy to use and require no special equipment.

Electrolysis: This is a more permanent method that uses a small electric current to destroy the hair follicle. It can be painful and may require multiple sessions.

Laser hair removal : It uses intense light to damage the hair follicles and slow down hair growth. It is more expensive than other methods, but it can provide long-term hair reduction.

It is worth noting that before trying any of these methods, it is important to patch test the area first to ensure that you are not allergic or sensitive to any of the products or equipment used. Also, it's always recommended to consult with a professional for best result and reduce the risk of any harm.

2. *How do I deal with my facial hair?*

There are several ways to deal with unwanted facial hair, depending on your personal preference and the level of hair growth. Here are a few options:

Shaving: As I mentioned earlier, shaving is a quick and easy method for removing facial hair. You can use a regular razor or an electric shaver to remove the hair. It is important to use a shaving cream or gel to help reduce irritation and make the process smoother.

Waxing: Waxing can be an effective way to remove facial hair from the root. You can either visit a salon or wax at home using a waxing kit. It

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

Ready for today’s Wednesday Wisdom?

Have you ever wondered what the one governing principle that governs all businesses might be? What is the name of the one value that every company considers to be crucial? Have you ever heard of something called the North Star Metric?

North Star Metric is a key business metric that reflects the core value a product delivers to its customers. It's a single, actionable metric that aligns all efforts towards achieving long-term growth. Let us learn about in greater detail, read the lesson carefully and we will connect in our upcoming scheduled session. 

Till then Happy learning!
16/03/23, 04:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian,
This week's Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the topic of \"Seeking Wealth, not Money or Status.\" This is an important lesson that will provide valuable insights into the pursuit of financial stability and success. During this lesson, we will explore the concept of wealth and its importance in building a sustainable financial future. We will discuss the difference between wealth, money, and status, and how each of these concepts plays a role in our lives.
I encourage you to read the lesson in detail and take notes to fully understand the material. It is important to engage with this topic and think critically about your own financial goals and aspirations.
By understanding the importance of seeking wealth over money or status, you can develop a more sustainable and fulfilling path towards financial success. I look forward to exploring this topic with you in more detail during our upcoming lesson.

Happy learning!","transform":"

I am pleased to observe that a majority of you comprehended well, the message  that was conveyed in this week's Wednesday wisdom. It brought me great joy to go through student’s perspectives on wealth creation and the mindset essential for embarking on this path.

I have a special Saturday assignment for you. The objective of this assignment is to help you understand the steps you can take to prepare yourself for wealth creation. The assignment will encourage you to identify their goals, develop a financial plan, and cultivate the mindset and habits needed to achieve financial success.

Here are some instructions to make it easy for you to work on this assignment:
1. Goal Setting: The first step towards wealth creation is to set clear and achievable goals. In this section, write down your short-term and long-term financial goals. Explain how each goal will contribute to your overall financial success.
2. Financial Planning: A financial plan is a roadmap that outlines how you will achieve your financial goals. In this section, develop a comprehensive financial plan that includes strategies for budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management. Identify the resources you will need to achieve your financial plan and explain how you will access them.
3. Mindset and Habits: Wealth creation is not just about having a financial plan; it is also about cultivating the mindset and habits that will help you achieve your goals. In this section, identify the mindset and habits that are necessary for financial success. Explain how you will cultivate these qualities in yourself and develop strategies to overcome any obstacles that may arise.
4. Conclusion: In this section, summarize your findings and discuss the importance of preparing yourself for wealth creation. Reflect on what you have learned throughout the assignment and discuss how you will apply these principles in your own life.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and let you know that I was overwhelmed by the response from students during my recent university visit. While I was thrilled to see so many of my students, I am currently working on performance evaluation of each one of them. Hence I would like to inform you that I will not be able to attend to your queries during the weekend that is tomorrow and day after. 

However, I would like to assure you that I will be available to connect with you in our upcoming session on Monday\/Tuesday. Please make sure you mark your calendars and plan to attend that session so we can address any questions or concerns you may have and proceed with our discussions then.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. I am looking forward to our next session and I hope to see you all there.

03/04/23, 12:54 - Saloni Rastogi: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

06/04/23, 05:38 - Saloni Rastogi: Dear Students,
I hope this message finds you well. As your EWYL progresses, it is important that you stay up to date with your assignments and coursework. In order to ensure that you are able to move forward with the new lessons, I want to remind you that you must complete all of your previous assignments by the end of this week.

It is essential that you take the time to thoroughly review and complete your previous assignments. Doing so will not only help you to understand the lesson better, but it will also prepare you for the upcoming lessons. Failure to complete the previous assignments may result in a delay of the new lessons, and ultimately, it may impact your EWYL progress.

Therefore, I urge you to make the completion of your previous assignments a priority. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to seeing your completed assignments and to sharing the new lessons with you soon.

Best regards,
Team EWYL","transform":"

12/07/22, 17:28 - Leslie EWYL21E0917: *Saturday activity response*

Skills are required in projects that are challenging so as to bring in a lot of learning needed in planning and management. 

Skills are important in project management. They are the project management techniques that allow project managers to do their job.

These skills refer to as the ability that an individual has to manage time and tasks in an efficient manner.

Some of these include the following. To start with, time management is one of the most triple constraints and most important technical skill.

 Secondly, task and team management skills create, organize, assign and track members to meet project constraints.  

Not only that, also risk management identifies and help to control its consequences thereby success.

In addition, cost and budget management are of great significance. This drives the project making sure actual costs exceed planning budget.

Not only that, scheduling and planning of skills are ideal as there are the foundation of the cycle. 

In summation, knowledge and proficiency skills in project management software are needed to manage tasks and foster collaboration.

How are you?
13/07/22, 00:55 - Unknown: First of all I am overjoyed and really gratified to see your enthusiasm every day towards our daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud EDOOFIAN'.
13/07/22, 00:57 - Unknown: Secondly, I am really glad to hear your understanding of the activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY* . They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.

Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

15/07/22, 20:18 - Unknown: Good morning Leslie!
How are you?
15/07/22, 20:20 - Unknown: Every day you amaze me with your enthusiasm and enjoyment towards our daily ritual.
15/07/22, 20:20 - Unknown: From his dad’s small foray into entrepreneurship, Patrice Motsepe got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe’s success story is a remarkable one showing how curiosity, doggedness, perseverance, and the knack to exploit great opportunities as they come, can determine how successful or not, any individual could become. 
And this was all about our WEDNESDAY WISDOM.
Hope you have gone through it.
I am so excited to listen to your thoughts and views HERE.
15/07/22, 20:21 - Unknown: Also as to the number of forms, I am sure a target of 3 forms on a daily basis will work for the community building project.
15/07/22, 20:22 - Unknown: After all this Leslie, please update me on the number of forms you have got filled under the IndianDoc project.
15/07/22, 22:04 - Leslie EWYL21E0917: I am doing fine Ma'am, how are you!
15/07/22, 22:04 - Leslie EWYL21E0917: Well, I will be trying to work towards the target.
15/07/22, 22:04 - Leslie EWYL21E0917: Unfortunately, I haven't any confirmations from students at the moment. I will be updating you.
15/07/22, 22:04 - Leslie EWYL21E0917: *Wednesday task response* 

I takeaway that Patrice Motsepe's Father was first a school teacher before starting a business of his own in the form of a mini-store. From his father's idea, He got his first exposure to the business world and understand business. 

He get up knowledge through mine workers always coming at liquor to buy drinks everyday before getting to work. 

Patrice then pursued his educational level and earn a law degree as well. He get a great job offer and grow in success. He pay a visit and met several mining firms and studied thier operations getting attracted in the business. 

The exposure thereby cause him to start studying the mining business through kinds of books and articles to have a complete understanding and technical business operations. 

Due to his hard work, he end up starting a mining firm. However the price of Gold was falling. He end up getting help from Bobby Godsell. The business end up profitable within a year.
15/07/22, 22:05 - Leslie EWYL21E0917: I'm here for today's session.
15/07/22, 22:07 - Unknown: I am doing great Leslie, thank you for showering so much concern each day, I feel blessed to be your mentor.
15/07/22, 22:07 - Unknown: I read your response Leslie and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a WAY. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. We can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.
15/07/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Yes Leslie, I will be waiting each day for the number of forms you will get filled each day under the community building project.
