14/12/22, 20:42 - Unknown: Good Morning my proud Edoofian

Christmas is celebrated by people all across the world, whether they are Christians or non Christians. Christmas is the perfect time when friends and families come together, spreading joy and happiness.You must be aware of the concept of \"SECRET SANTA,\" but do you know who he or she was, or how the lovely process of sharing joy began? In today's Wednesday Wisdom, let's find out more about the secret Santa. The secret Santa has a special message for you at the end. We'll get in touch and discuss your takeaways in more detail.

Happy learning and smiling!
14/12/22, 20:46 - Vanessa EWYL22E0589: Secret Santa helps with kindness and it makes the world a conducive and better place to live
14/12/22, 20:49 - Unknown: Would you explain this in detail, Vanessa?
14/12/22, 20:50 - Vanessa EWYL22E0589: Secret Santa is a person with a hidden identity who randomly gifts people usually in kindness. This manages to help the hungry and less privileged and needy which then makes the world a better place
14/12/22, 22:54 - Unknown: Great!
I am sure that this lesson was interesting for you?
14/12/22, 22:54 - Vanessa EWYL22E0589: Very interesting
14/12/22, 22:55 - Unknown: I am glad to hear that
15/12/22, 17:23 - Vanessa EWYL22E0589: Good morning
15/12/22, 17:23 - Vanessa EWYL22E0589: I'm a proud Edoofian
15/12/22, 17:23 - Vanessa EWYL22E0589: I've talked to the principals and they said by end of today
15/12/22, 17:24 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

17/12/22, 21:12 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, 
_I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?_

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!
17/12/22, 21:31 - Vanessa EWYL22E0589: To begin with from our Wednesday lesson we learnt that secret Santa is a person with a secret identity and offers help in any way possible hence I decided to be a secret Santa to this other Zimbabwean girl little who's an orphan and street kid. The reason why I chose to be her secret Santa is that she is generous. She stands in the highway asking for money and food so this other time she said to my mom as she was driving ma'am can I please have money and my mom responded by saying right now I have nothing I'm also looking for money so that your sisters will have something to eat today. Lucky enough some person had helped that girl with a 10 USD note and she said you can have this go buy your kids food it was a very emotional moment for me to see a street kid who gives because these children are bullies and rude in most cases. If I am to gift her ill gift her clothes Food and money because from that incident it shows she's a great person and she'll be extremely happy and thrilled to have clothes money and food. Because of what she did I want to be her secret Santa this Christmas
