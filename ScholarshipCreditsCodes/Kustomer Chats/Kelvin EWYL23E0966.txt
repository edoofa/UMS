Let us begin our session with an interesting fact!

Did you know that a group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance.' So, just like the flamboyance of flamingos, let's add a touch of flair to our session today.

Ready to soar into the world of curiosity?ü¶©
22/01/24, 13:35 - Kelvin EWYL23E0966: Let's do it
22/01/24, 13:45 - Ananya: Well, I hope you now understand the reason why I always say never miss your lesson. It's been two absences for your session in a week. Is this something you want? As your mentor, I know how passionate and sincere you are. I don't want you to make a bad impression over a small thing. You missed your Saturday activity again because you did not follow your EWYL ritual. What should we do now?
22/01/24, 13:47 - Kelvin EWYL23E0966: I am so sorry I heard like you say our sessions will be Monday and Thursday so I really sorry
22/01/24, 13:47 - Kelvin EWYL23E0966: I won't miss again

22/01/24, 13:56 - Ananya: All right. By the way, many of my students have already earned $100-$200, and I want to share their secret with you! You know, I set weekly and monthly goals for them. This has proven to be the best way to earn credits in a strategic manner. I was thinking of starting this with you as well. Are you in?
22/01/24, 13:57 - Kelvin EWYL23E0966: Yes I am in
22/01/24, 13:59 - Ananya: Alright, so connecting with 5 students and submitting their application forms with me is your weekend target! Remember, our goal is to earn $100 in the next month. To achieve that, we will set a weekend target, giving you enough time to work and connect with your students! I have a vision for both of us ‚Äì we will earn enough credits so that you won't need to spend a single penny for your second-semester fee, and we will achieve it.
22/01/24, 14:02 - Kelvin EWYL23E0966: Yes we will achieve it . I will do that
