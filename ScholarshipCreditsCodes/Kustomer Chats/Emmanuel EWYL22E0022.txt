06/10/22, 14:46 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

I hope that you are doing well

Here is a motivational quote for you:
“There are no shortcuts to any place worth going.” – Beverly Sills
31/10/22, 19:39 - Unknown: Saturday Activity

\"A goal is not always meant to be reached; it often serves simply as something to aim at.\" –Bruce Lee

The above quote more or less means True success is all about working towards meaningful goals and dreams.

And this was somewhat the idea we learned and discussed in our Wednesday Lesson as well, the mindset of a winner and the habits that lead to it.

In this week's activity, you shall be putting this to use in your own working zone, by creating a list of targets\/goals, that you shall aim to achieve in a week. For a suggestion, you can start by setting up a number of Schools you would try connecting to in a week, the number of companies you shall reach out to, or the number of fellow community mates you would tell about edoofa.

This list, you shall share this with your mentors, and they would also keep a note of it. At the end of the week, you shall discuss with them, whether or not were you able to achieve the target, and what kind of mindset change did this activity lead you to.

Please make the submission using this form:
Project Chosen:
Target:

I hope you all will try to push your limits and aim at the sky always. This activity should be a part of habit building, which would make you a better and more organized individual and professional.

Happy Learning, and Blessed Weekend.

I wish that you have an amazing week.
Best of Luck and Work hard!

04/11/22, 02:05 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We all have come across the quote, \"Quitters Never Win, and Winners Never Quit\", and we also must have experienced this in our lives, directly or indirectly.

If last week's lesson, taught you the mindset of a winner, this week's lesson is going to teach you the true nature of a winner. Someone, who never gives up, or quits on the dream they see and really want to fulfill, no matter what. Moving through scorching heat, drenching rains, and heavy snow, they reach their destination and complete their journey. In this lesson, you will also learn, what happens when an entire community inherits this trait and keeps working on it. How recognition is earned and respect is gained through time, patience, and endless efforts.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.
04/11/22, 22:29 - Unknown: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian!

I want you to read and understand the article from the link that has been sent to you, and then answer the following question for me.
https:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/opinion\/op-ed\/Mandela-and-the-Mahatma\/article12009462.ece 

I want you to ponder over your understanding of the article and then choose from one of these options,
1. would you like to be the person who breaks this negative cycle and move towards a better path formation,
or
2. would you stay in the same cycle and wait for someone to initiate the change?

I want you to support your answer with a brief reason for the choice.
05/11/22, 21:44 - Unknown: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian!

“My job is not to be easy on people. My job is to make them better.”- Steve Jobs

And till now, our founder Mr. Angad has always been a guiding light for everyone at Edoofa. And has made sure we all turn out to be future leaders in our fields, no matter how hard it seems, we should keep moving with single harmony toward our goals and motives. But, leadership can not only be taught, as it is not a literary subject, but a practical life experience that is to be taken up and practiced and bettered with each passing day.

Hence, after the very encouraging Wednesday lesson on how good leadership and patience can change the entire ideology and perception of a community to grow back from the ashes. Today's Activity is going to give you a first-hand experience to fit yourselves in a small part of the leadership shoes. I want you to create a newsletter of your own. Similar to the ones you have enjoyed reading every Sunday from the founder's office.

Your Newsletter should consider the following things:  Quotes that have been motivating you for some time now, or your three favorite quotes which motivate you to be better every day.
and,
2. One story of your idol, that can be any person, who according to you has contributed to making the community and world a better place for people to live. The story should also consist of a part stating the reason why they are your idol.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own capabilities while performing this activity.

The best newsletters of the week shall be shared with all the fellow edoofians next week.

Have a wonderful weekend ahead.
05/11/22, 22:13 - Unknown: The deadline for the submission of this newsletter is 12 pm Zimbabwe Time Monday.

How are you?

In the past few days, You must have observed that I was not very active on the EWYL DEDICATED LINE.

Since I am back now, I would like us to start our engagement again with full zeal and enthusiasm.
I hope that you are with me on this.

10/11/22, 18:16 - Unknown: Before, We move forward, Let me share the Wednesday Lesson with you that got missed yesterday.

Wednesday Lesson

Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian,

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Deadline: Saturday 9 AM
Happy Learning.
10/11/22, 18:17 - Unknown: Also, I hope that you are aware that we have our scheduled session tomorrow.
So, Proud Edoofian, Please make sure that you are available to connect actively during our session timings Tomorrow at *9:00 AM* Zimb Time i.e. *12:30 PM* Indian Time

Since, We do not have our scheduled session today, This does not mean that you do not have to share the Project Progress Form that I shared with you yesterday.
Please make sure that you share it today. We will have a discussion on it tomorrow in our session.
10/11/22, 18:17 - Unknown: Emmanuel, May I know where have you shared the Student Application Forms yesterday?
10/11/22, 18:36 - Emmanuel EWYL22E0022: The counselor say I have to add them to to the counseling group with their forms
10/11/22, 21:06 - Unknown: Okay 
That's Great!
Just give me an update whenever you add any form, okay?
10/11/22, 21:09 - Emmanuel EWYL22E0022: Ok Sir
25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

29/07/22, 20:21 - Unknown: Hello Edoofian, how are you doing?

Please send the \"Proud Edoofian\" chant for the day.
31/07/22, 21:34 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. \r
﻿\r
So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!\r
﻿\r
Happy Weekend!\r

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
