02/12/23, 16:43 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL
02/12/23, 17:35 - Abdul EWYL23E0722: *Spirit of Competition*

It is displayed by pushing harder than others , demonstrating a higher level of skill, consistently performing at an elevated level and are the people that others look up to as leaders and role models .

There are also many factors associated with competitiveness including personality treats like extraversion, neuroticism and conscientiousness, as well as situational factors like the presence of a rival or the perceived difficulty of a task . 

This spirit of Competition has made me to realize that what other does I am able to do it . It only takes time and patient is needed for one to be called he is successful. This spirit of Competition has been a push factor to me towards my goals and had make me to boast my confidence to face all the challenges that act as a barrier between me and my goals .

With this spirit of Competition it helps one to approach those at higher levels for knowledge and help them to be successful and be confidential in every task they want to approach.
02/12/23, 20:23 - Aditi Kapoor: Absolutely, embracing the spirit of competition can be a powerful driver for personal and professional growth. Your acknowledgment of pushing yourself beyond limits, showcasing advanced skills, and maintaining consistent high performance resonates with the essence of healthy competition.
Indeed, competition is not just about outperforming others but also about continuous self-improvement. It's inspiring to hear that this mindset has led you to recognize your own capabilities and potential. Becoming a role model and leader in your field is a testament to the dedication and effort you invest in your pursuits.
02/12/23, 20:23 - Aditi Kapoor: I apologize for any inconvenience. I'd like to inform you that I encountered a technical glitch due to which last week's activity was shared again with you. I appreciate your understanding and patience in this matter.
02/12/23, 20:24 - Aditi Kapoor: _*Hello, my Proud Edoofian*_!

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

03/12/23, 22:51 - Abdul EWYL23E0722: As I was researching for my project I found it not to be easy but I told my self not to lose hope since hope is the light to my success . I have been seeking help from my friends so that they can help me to kink up with their headmaster but is quite seems as if these headmaster are quite busy and weren't not giving a proper attention to my request but this also had also boosted  confidence in so that I would be able to approach others school head masters.  

I have learned that success doesn't come easily, you have to work hard so that at the end you earn it . Hard work and patient is also a factor that's leads one towards success and achieve a goal.

09/12/23, 16:49 - Aditi Kapoor: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!
