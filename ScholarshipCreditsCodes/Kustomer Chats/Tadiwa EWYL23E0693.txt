It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.

To facilitate this process, we kindly request all students to submit their time management strategies and plans for maintaining constant communication with mentors during the exam period.
Your submitted strategies will not only help you stay on track during the exam period but also enable your mentors to provide you with the support and guidance you need.
We appreciate your proactive approach to effective time management and mentor communication during this crucial time. Your success is our priority, and we are here to support you every step of the way.

04/10/23, 13:45 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofians,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning
