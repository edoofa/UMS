23/06/23, 17:16 - Mitchell EWYL23E0243: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line in this format:

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.

23/06/23, 17:48 - Ananya: For today, I have a task for you related to the community-building project. I would like you to approach only four students and ask them to fill in the forms and submit them to me by tomorrow evening.

Comment if you have been working on the community building project and how many aspiring Edoofians have enrolled through you!
28/06/23, 20:30 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

Team EWYL

Tell us if these were helpful for you in the comments below!
30/06/23, 17:30 - Ananya: Greetings my proud Edoofian!
How are you today? Are you ready for your session?
30/06/23, 19:06 - Mitchell EWYL23E0243: Sorry  being  late ma'am  it was due to electricity problem this side
01/07/23, 16:00 - Ananya: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!

Use Google to search for the specific school's name and locate their Facebook or Instagram page.
On their social media page, check the followers or moments section to find students studying there.
Look for the contact information of the school head or principal.
Connect with the school head while simultaneously reaching out to the students for your community building project.
