15/12/23, 13:30 - Unknown: So, what has been the challenge exactly?
15/12/23, 13:31 - Unknown: It's great to hear that you're actively reaching out to headmasters for your project! Building connections with school leaders is a crucial step. What specific challenges or roadblocks are you currently facing in your efforts to connect with them, and how do you plan to overcome these obstacles to move your project forward?

15/12/23, 14:46 - Unknown: I appreciate your persistence and dedication to overcoming challenges in connecting with participants and school heads during the holiday season. It's understandable that the extended holiday period might be affecting response times. Here are some strategies to navigate this situation:
For Participant Connection:
Holiday-Friendly Messaging:Craft messages that acknowledge the holiday season and express understanding of their busy schedules.
Highlight the importance of the program and reassure them that you'll be available to discuss further when they have the time.

Scheduled Follow-Ups:Schedule follow-up messages or calls for a later date when the holiday rush subsides. This ensures that your outreach efforts remain on their radar.

Utilize Multiple Channels:If possible, try reaching out through different communication channels (email, text, social media) to increase the chances of getting through.
15/12/23, 14:46 - Unknown: For School Head Connection:
Respectful Follow-Up:Send a respectful follow-up message to the school heads, acknowledging the busy holiday season and expressing your continued interest in discussing the project.

Offer Flexibility:Provide options for flexible meeting times or modes of communication to accommodate their schedules.

Alternate Contact Methods:If you have alternative contact methods (email, office phone), try using those to ensure your message reaches them.
15/12/23, 14:46 - Unknown: Remember, challenges are a part of the journey, and your perseverance  will play a crucial role in overcoming them. Continue your efforts, and  I'm confident that your dedication will yield positive results. If you  encounter any specific roadblocks, feel free to seek further guidance.

16/12/23, 02:07 - Panashe EWYL23E0620: Is there any problem if l write it about someone l really know all it should be a narration from someone's story
16/12/23, 13:40 - Panashe EWYL23E0620: Once upon a time, there was a boy in the village who's name called Nigel. Nigel dreamt himself becoming successful but there was a question that came in his head "How can l become successful?".
The boy woke up and the question was still in his head troubling him about how can l make the dream alive.Nigel tried to answer the question using the situation he was experiencing by that time, he was living with his grandma. His grandma was the only one around the boy since birth of the as his passed away in a car accident. Now the boy was 18 years doing his Upper 6 at a local school in his hood called Mwami High school.
Nigel was still trying to figure things out about how can l become successful as l dreamt.He suggested that it was the best to ask his grandma this question. He asked his grandma the question and the grandma gave thoughtful response that left the boy hungry for more.Grandma told the about boy that"if you want to be successful you should be a hard worker, consistent and believe in what you do".
Nigel gave himself a challenge that he's going to do the best that had never been seen at Mwami. At this school noone passed A Level with 15 points.So he used the words of his grandma wisely by taking them seriously in what he was doing.He always remembered the dream he had dreamt .He wrote his final A Level exams remembering the words of his grandma that encouraged him to do the best in what he was doing.
Despite the challenge that he was living with grandma who wasn't able to do better jobs so that they can afford a better life he managed to pass his exams with 15 points which had never been seen happening at Mwami High.
He became a motivation to others through his wise words which says, "if you believe, trust and work hard you can be everything you want to be. No situation is guaranteed to let you down because everything that don't break you makes you stronger".
