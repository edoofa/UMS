01/02/23, 19:26 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

Happy Learning!
01/02/23, 19:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Awesome progress bringing in more fellow proud Edoofians!
01/02/23, 19:31 - Kudakwashe EWYL22E0465: Thank you Sir

01/02/23, 23:29 - Kudakwashe EWYL22E0465: I have learnt that:
1.LinkedIn offers a section on my profile to feature\r
examples of my achievements and other work.
2.Then i can upload any work i  have done\rduring my course which someone can use as his\/her motivation.
3.I may even to\ruse it as a platform to meet and get to know others at my university that i may not have\r
met in person yet and there’s no limit to the reasons why i may want to connect with others.
4.LinkedIn groups can become the best way to network with people that share similar interests\r
to me.
5.LinkedIn can essentially makes up me to make my  personal brand.

I am a proud Edoofian.

02/08/22, 19:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times pere week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"
02/08/22, 19:28 - Kudakwashe EWYL22E0465: I am a proud Edoofian
02/08/22, 19:30 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
02/08/22, 21:00 - Saloni Rastogi: Amazing Kudakwashe! This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.

The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years. The price is knowing that time is working on your side even when the results don’t show it.

07/08/22, 20:12 - Kudakwashe EWYL22E0465: From Gilbert Eugene Peters secrets and straits l have learnt that nothing comes on a silver plate,but you have to sweat for it.As a young gifted boy he deduced that Enterpreneurship is not a straight road,it meanders and at times situations distracts your objection to an extend of you losing hope.However you have to strive hard until you get it finally.The hurdles and resistances you encounter are there to stand as the test of the time and you have to overcome them.When an idea comes to your mind not many would see it the way you do but you have to believe it yourself and strive to implement it.There is a saying which reads 'If you think hiring professionals is expensive then try hiring armateurs\".From Gilbert Eugene Peters secrets it sounds quite true that the best bussiness decision you can ever make is hiring the right people and the worst bussiness mistake you can ever make is partnering with wrong people.Friends may sometimes distracts you from your good idea ,so at times you would rather go it alone.So know who to associate and partner with in life.

12/08/22, 17:27 - Kudakwashe EWYL22E0465: Success comes easier to some than to others.It sounds very interesting and life is hinged to that pespective.
12/08/22, 17:34 - Kudakwashe EWYL22E0465: Few things may happen by chance but that chance may come when you are dead,so one should make hay while sun shines.In reality we shoud not live by chance for it could never come and if you live by chance you will live in fear and anxiety.So one shoul live by intent and capability so that you would be in control of what can happen in life and if so you can have a stable life
12/08/22, 17:45 - Kudakwashe EWYL22E0465: A committed person has no failure in life for a failure in life gives one to learn more from that and do improve and altimately succeed.This committment creates an organised mindset hence your emotions,energies and body and as well creats a belief that nothing is impossible .With this you become a creator in many ways.
12/08/22, 17:53 - Kudakwashe EWYL22E0465: To become succeesful constantly gets inspired with whatever you do for the little you contribute haas a great dimension of this world.So really you should be concious to your contribiot so that you get inspired.
