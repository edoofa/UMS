Understanding Leadership 
Throughout history,great leaders have emerged with particular leadership styles in providing direction,implementing plans and motivating people. Let us focus on servant leadership. Servant Leadership is a leadership philosophy in which the goal of the leader is to serve. A servant leader shares power puts the needs of the employees first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible. Like our Edoofa program Mr Angad Singh and Mr Avreen Singh . 
There are 10 important characteristics of servant leaders 
1 Listening: You‚Äôll serve people better when you make a deep commitment to listen intently to them and understanding what they‚Äôre saying. 
2 Empathy: Servant leaders strive to understand other people intentions and perspectives.
3 Healing : This characteristic relates to the emotional health and wholeness of people and involve supporting them both physically and mentally. 
4 self Awareness: Self awareness is the ability to look at yourself,think deeply about your emotions and behaviour. 
5 Persuasion : Servant Leader use persuasion rather than their authority to encourage people to take action 
6 Conceptualisations: It relates to your ability to dream great dreams,so that you look beyond day to day realities to the bigger picture.
7 foresight; foresight is when you can predict what likely to happen in the future by learning from past experience. 
8 Stewardship: is about taking responsibility for actions and performance of your team. 
9 Commitment to the Growth of People : servant leaders are committed to the people and professional development of everyone on their teams 
10 Building Community: The last characteristic has to do with building a sense of community within your organisation.

Self awareness  
-is about one‚Äôs self can be really daunting, even for adults but it is a key to build the life that‚Äôs aspire to have. 
- to be self aware you should be able to identify your emotions, see yourself honestly,recognise your strength and witnesses and have the plan to work towards them. 
Like the phrase  ‚ÄúThe Silent President ‚Äú Buy the first black president of America Mr Barack Obama . Mr Obama very early once figured out that he‚Äôs most productive when in solitude. He mentioned instances of him having an early dinner with his family and spending time with himself for at least 4-5 hours every day past dinner. ‚ÄúEverybody carves out their time to get their thoughts together. There is no doubt that window is his window ‚Äúhe says. So he focus on creating boundaries for himself. When you are dealing with worldwide issues to build the most powerful nation in the world, you need to know how to prioritise your schedule and that strats by saying NO . It takes a huge amount of discipline to spend time with yourself daily,being honest with yourself.
29/05/23, 16:34 - Ananya: Indeed, Self-awareness is indeed a profound aspect of personal growth, and it can be a challenging journey, even for adults. However, it is a crucial key to building the life you aspire to have. To develop self-awareness, it is essential to be able to identify and understand your emotions, honestly assess yourself, recognize both your strengths and weaknesses, and have a plan in place to actively work towards personal growth and improvement. Your insights reflect a deep understanding of the importance of self-reflection and self-improvement.

29/05/23, 17:00 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
