How are you?
01/10/22, 20:34 - Unknown: Since you raised your concerns about your understanding of the Wednesday lesson, let me bring some light to it:
1. The main focus of the lesson was on how you are willing to earn scholarship credits through projects
2. Your plan to take forward this zeal, how do you target to achieve them
01/10/22, 21:04 - Esther EWYL21E0055: Alright
01/10/22, 21:07 - Esther EWYL21E0055: So in these lessons l will be learning some of the skills

How was your weekend?
04/10/22, 00:54 - Unknown: Rather that using any asterisk while saying the proud edoofian ritual, just type, 'I am a proud edoofian'.
04/10/22, 19:05 - Esther EWYL21E0055: Good morning
04/10/22, 19:06 - Esther EWYL21E0055: I am a proud Edoofian
04/10/22, 19:08 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

How was your weekend?

This weekend's activity was very interesting. I am very excited to discuss how you, my proud student, have planned your way to becoming _the edoofian of the month_ and _accomplishing their targets_. This weekend activity asked students to tell the following:
a) Target- no. of credits you want to earn in October
b) How many projects can you work upon
c) Number of hours that you can devote to your projects
d) Name of the projects that you want to be a part of
e) Plan of action with your mentors

In our session on the *EWYL Line*, we will be discussing:
1. your response to the same
05/10/22, 19:55 - Unknown: Greetings Esther!
How are you?
05/10/22, 20:00 - Unknown: Please excuse me for the inconvenience caused in yesterday's session, I was facing severe connectivity issues so I was not able to take your session.
Your session will be held on Friday as per our schedule since the organization is observing an off today on the eve of our religious festival, Dussehra.
Once I come back on Friday for your session, I want that you get some research done on what is Dussehra and why it is celebrated, we will surely discuss it in our session on Friday along with your weekend activity response, which will be very much exciting?

09/10/22, 15:45 - Unknown: Hello *My Proud Edoofian*!

Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.
Responses will be accepted on the *EWYL Line* only.
_Till then keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'_.

Happy learning and enjoy your weekend!
09/10/22, 15:46 - Unknown: I am sorry to hear about your loss, hope that Almighty keeps you and your entire family strong at such times.

12/10/22, 00:22 - Unknown: And I very well inform you about the same.
12/10/22, 00:23 - Esther EWYL21E0055: Yes you did

12/10/22, 04:25 - Unknown: Sure Esther.
But may I know the reason behind this delay?
12/10/22, 04:31 - Esther EWYL21E0055: Truly speaking màam didnt know where to start creating the video
12/10/22, 04:41 - Unknown: You have to choose why you think India is a suitable land to complete your educational journey.

12/10/22, 18:12 - Esther EWYL21E0055: Alright maam
12/10/22, 21:25 - Esther EWYL21E0055: Is it only for 30 seconds am l not allowed to exceed that
13/10/22, 00:41 - Unknown: You can extend that, don't worry.
13/10/22, 00:41 - Unknown: We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real-life example. That is how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because in the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.
Responses will be submitted on the EWYL Line only.

Happy Learning.

How are you?

This week I want you to reflect on your strengths and skills to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 
These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content, etc.

In the session on the *EWYL Line*, we will discuss:
1) your social media skill
2) pending response to the Wednesday lesson

How are you?
20/10/22, 20:08 - Unknown: I am happy to tell you that this weekend we are having our great Indian festival, Deepawali and you know this festival holds a special place in the hearts of all Indian families. So yesterday, everyone in our office wore Ethnic dresses and celebrate Deepawali's party where we exchanged gifts and lit up the office with diyas and candles.
Due to this, there was a delay in sending you the Wednesday lesson for this week.
Please see to it and we will have a session tomorrow on the same because I want to give you time to ponder and work on it.
20/10/22, 20:08 - Unknown: In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.
