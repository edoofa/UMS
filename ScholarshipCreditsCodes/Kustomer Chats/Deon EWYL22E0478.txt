03/10/22, 20:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
How was your weekend?

This weekend's activity was very interesting. I am very excited to discuss how you, my proud student, have planned your way to becoming _the edoofian of the month_ and _accomplishing their targets_. This weekend activity asked students to tell the following:
a) Target- no. of credits you want to earn in October
b) How many projects can you work upon
c) Number of hours that you can devote to your projects
d) Name of the projects that you want to be a part of
e) Plan of action with your mentors

In our session on the *EWYL Line*, we will be discussing:
1. your response to the same
03/10/22, 20:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me share the messages after that.
03/10/22, 20:16 - Saloni Rastogi: That you can send to the school head.
03/10/22, 20:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education   All. 

Edoofa is a social for-profit organization that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!
03/10/22, 20:18 - Saloni Rastogi: Sir,\/Mam, Do you know that ABC School (I will be providing you with the name of this school) which is in our province is a proud partner of Edoofa?
03/10/22, 20:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Over the past 2 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his\/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as a company wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. With the quality of education provided to the student completing high school, edoofa would want to transform your school’s every student into a person who’s so strong in the knowledge that he\/she becomes better than her peers. Coupled with the Earn While you Learn program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he\/she has got more opportunities to chase him\/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development\/growth.
03/10/22, 20:19 - Saloni Rastogi: By Sharing the above information, We have completed the Introduction part. Now, It is time to explain with examples How Edoofa is revolutionizing the Education System on the African Continent. Examples create clarity. This is why they are used in all contexts as a tool to provide further understanding. When it comes to your conversation, examples play a significant role in your ability to effectively communicate the elements that you want the School Head to understand.
03/10/22, 20:20 - Saloni Rastogi: Sir\/ Mam, I would like to share some examples regarding How Edoofa is revolutionizing the Education System in the African Continent.

Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *90 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

Their associate partner, *Mr. Shorwi Kawadza*is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of *Hartzell High School*. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with them for the past *Four Years* from which more than _80 students_ have enrolled and arrived in India already.
03/10/22, 20:20 - Saloni Rastogi: The Child of the DEO, Manicaland Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 


_United College of Education_, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and _Respected Sir Adam Luthuli_ has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 


Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, _Headmaster of Chibuwe High_, the son of Ms. Christina Rockson, _The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School_, South Africa, and the child of Mrs. Aleta Makomeke, _DEO at Masvingo province_ are Edoofians and they have many more success stories from _St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High_, etc.
03/10/22, 20:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Proud Edoofian, Now that we have shown the data of how Edoofa is benefiting the African Continent, Now it is the perfect time for us to show how Edoofa helps a particular school.
03/10/22, 20:22 - Saloni Rastogi: Schools that have partnered with us have seen higher rates of admission through shaping careers and facilitating higher education decision-making for students looking to study abroad in India through the famed Edoofa Scholarship Program which leads to life transformation events for deserving African students.


Along with this, schools can be benefitted in the following way:

06/10/22, 20:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
How are you doing?

As students, we constantly learn and expose ourselves to situations that help us learn anything and everything, but we must remember that each of us has the same number of hours in a day. Hence we must treat it important that we treat our Time as the currency of life. *Time Management* is essentially Priority Management.

In our session today on the *EWYL Line*, we will discuss:
1. How managing time is necessary

This what you shared with me earlier.
08/10/22, 04:33 - Saloni Rastogi: I am happy to hear you out on this Deon. It is very necessary that I teach my students how to MANAGE TIME.
One who can do that is a HERO, and one who fails, life gives ZERO attention to them.
Let me share something with you regarding the same.
08/10/22, 05:13 - Deon EWYL22E0478: From our lesson l understood that for me to be a successful individual I should set my goals correctly, prioritize my time, set up a time limit, take breaks between tasks, organize myself, remove the not so useful tasks and plan ahead

In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. Those unfamiliar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.
Responses will be accepted on the *EWYL Line* only.
_Till then keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'_.

Happy learning and enjoy your weekend!
