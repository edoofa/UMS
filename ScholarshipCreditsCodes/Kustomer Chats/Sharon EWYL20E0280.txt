28/10/22, 23:09 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Proud Edoofian! Are you ready for your session?
28/10/22, 23:25 - Sharon EWYL20E0280: Yes
28/10/22, 23:25 - Aditi Kapoor: Glad to hear from you Sharon! How are you feeling today?
28/10/22, 23:26 - Sharon EWYL20E0280: Am doing good, how are you sir
28/10/22, 23:27 - Aditi Kapoor: I am doing good as well, thank you for asking.
28/10/22, 23:29 - Aditi Kapoor: So Sharon! Can you please brief me about the 3 types of projects we work on, here at EWYL, and also your experience working on them?
28/10/22, 23:40 - Sharon EWYL20E0280: Oky
28/10/22, 23:45 - Sharon EWYL20E0280: Project 1 its corporate alliances where i am looking  for companies on the internet, share about  Edoofa to them and schedule meeting  between  companies' CEO and director of Edoofa
28/10/22, 23:47 - Aditi Kapoor: Great! Please continue.
28/10/22, 23:50 - Sharon EWYL20E0280: Project 2 its community building  where l am too  reach out to my former mates, relatives, friends and youths and share about Edoofa to  them, persuade them to apply for  Edoofa Scholarship Program
28/10/22, 23:53 - Aditi Kapoor: Great! And the last one?
28/10/22, 23:55 - Sharon EWYL20E0280: Project 3 its African School education reform mission whereby i am to reach out to schools in my region and share about Edoofa to the school Heads\/Principal starting with my former school. I should set up meetings between them and Edoofa director  and share the details
28/10/22, 23:55 - Aditi Kapoor: Although! I would want you to correct a bit here Sharon! We do not want to persuade people to join us, it si not about persuasion, but about motivation and building trust! Because in the end, our goal should be to help other students attain their dream of higher education or foreign education so that they can work towards building a better future for themselves as well as the community.
28/10/22, 23:56 - Sharon EWYL20E0280: Ok i get it
28/10/22, 23:57 - Aditi Kapoor: I am really glad to know your crystal clear understanding of the projects Sharon! May I know, which projects have you previously worked on, and which one did you enjoy the most?
28/10/22, 23:59 - Sharon EWYL20E0280: I worked on all three of them and i liked community building  the most but its not easy to do it
29/10/22, 00:05 - Aditi Kapoor: I understand that Sharon! But if you think about it, anything that gives us an edge over others and makes us better at our jobs is never going to come easy! That is what the hustle is about, right?

I want you to start working on these projects again! The School and Company Connect ones! I would suggest you take one hour off your schedule and search companies and schools, gather info, and try connecting with them.

Moreover, I want you to not take community building, just as a project, but as our duty and responsibility to give back to the community! Which I guess is our end goal. Consider this as the first step of serving your community and society, by guiding them on a path to better education, and then a better life.
29/10/22, 00:06 - Sharon EWYL20E0280: Ok
29/10/22, 00:09 - Aditi Kapoor: Great! Do you have any questions or queries for me, or anything I can help you with?

30/10/22, 03:19 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian.
I hope you are doing well.

\"A goal is not always meant to be reached; it often serves simply as something to aim at.\" –Bruce Lee

The above quote more or less means True success is all about working towards meaningful goals and dreams.

And this was somewhat the idea we learned and discussed in our Wednesday Lesson as well, the mindset of a winner and the habits that lead to it.

In this week's activity, you shall be putting this to use in your own working zone, by creating a list of targets\/goals, that you shall aim to achieve in a week. For a suggestion, you can start by setting up a number of Schools you would try connecting to in a week, or the number of companies you shall reach out to, or the number of fellow community mates you would tell about edoofa.

This list, you shall share this with your mentors, and they would also keep a note of it. At the end of the week, you shall discuss with them, whether or not were you able to achieve the target, and what kind of mindset change did this activity lead you to.

I hope you all will try to push your limits and aim at the sky always. This activity should be a part of habit building, which would make you a better and more organized individual and professional.

Happy Learning, and Blessed Weekend.

02/11/22, 23:23 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We all have come across the quote, \"Quitters Never Win, and Winners Never Quit\", and we also must have experienced this in our lives, directly or indirectly.

If last week's lesson, taught you the mindset of a winner, this week's lesson is going to teach you the true nature of a winner. Someone, who never gives up, or quits on the dream they see and really want to fulfill, no matter what. Moving through scorching heat, drenching rains, and heavy snow, they reach their destination and complete their journey. In this lesson, you will also learn, what happens when an entire community inherits this trait and keeps working on it. How recognition is earned and respect is gained through time, patience, and endless efforts.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

“My job is not to be easy on people. My job is to make them better.”- Steve Jobs

And till now, our founder Mr. Angad has always been a guiding light for everyone at Edoofa. And has made sure we all turn out to be future leaders in our fields, no matter how hard it seems, we should keep moving with single harmony toward our goals and motives. But, leadership can not only be taught, as it is not a literary subject, but a practical life experience that is to be taken up and practiced and bettered with each passing day.

Hence, after the very encouraging Wednesday lesson on how good leadership and patience can change the entire ideology and perception of a community to grow back from the ashes. Today's Activity is going to give you a first-hand experience to fit yourselves in a small part of the leadership shoes. I want you to create a newsletter of your own. Similar to the ones you have enjoyed reading every Sunday from the founder's office.

Your Newsletter should consider the following things:  Quotes that have been motivating you for some time now, or your three favorite quotes which motivate you to be better every day.
and,
2. One story of your idol, that can be any person, who according to you has contributed to making the community and world a better place for people to live. The story should also consist of a part stating the reason why they are your idol.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own capabilities while performing this activity.

The best newsletters of the week shall be shared with all the fellow edoofians next week.

Have a wonderful weekend ahead.
05/11/22, 22:11 - Aditi Kapoor: The deadline for the submission of this newsletter is 12 pm Zimbabwe Time Monday.

understood the mining business. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe’s success story is a remarkable one showing how curiosity, doggedness, perseverance, and the knack to exploit great opportunities as they come, can determine how successful or not, any individual could
become.  And this was all about our WEDNESDAY WISDOM.

15/07/22, 02:47 - Unknown: I read your response Sharon and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a way. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. With can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.

18/07/22, 21:08 - Unknown: Hello my proud EDOOFIAN!
I hope you are doing well.
SWOT analysis might sound something complex but I am sure that while going through our weekend activity, you might have gone through what a SWOT means thoroughly and gained much knowledge on the same. The weekend activity asked us to draw a SWOT analysis of any company.
I want to share your response with me here Sharon.
19/07/22, 00:36 - Sharon EWYL20E0280: One of the fasted growing sector in Zimbabwe is farming.

 Zimbabwe’s commercial farming sector is traditionally a source of exports and foreign exchange. Additionally, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) assists Zimbabwe’s farmers to adopt conservation agriculture techniques.
Furthermore, the institute helps in increasing yield through a sustainable method of farming. Hence, you can consider a business in the agriculture and farming sector in Zimbabwe as fast growing industry. 

The SWOT analysis helps to provide direction for the farm business and serves as a basis for the farm’s business plans. It can indicate Strengths and Opportunities that will help the farm to achieve its goals, or indicate an obstacle that must be overcome or minimized to achieve success (Weaknesses or Threats). The objective is to help the farm business to plan strategies that take advantage of the strengths, counter the threats, and improve the weaknesses. Once all of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to the farming operation have been listed, the information should be combined and strategies developed.

Agricultural strengths include 
easy traceability, continuous availability of raw material (trout),market already exists and it is growing and there is a slow increasing demand. 

Where there are strengths there are also weaknesses, hence agricultural weaknesses inlcude unpredictable production output due to climatic influence.There is competition from marine fish,lnsufficient communication between farmers, associations and policy makers.Missing coherent policies (both at national and Community level) is the other weakness. 

In every problem, there's a solution but in the agricultural business the solution tends to be the opportunities. Development of on-farm activities (angling, eco-tourism ),multi-species production (pond farming) and Local markets are the opportunities available. 

Lastly th
19/07/22, 04:21 - Unknown: Greetings Sharon!
How did your day go?
19/07/22, 04:22 - Unknown: I am so amazed to see your response, Sharon. Horticulture is Zimbabwe's fifth-largest agricultural export earner, contributing 6.5% to the agricultural GDP. Production of horticultural crops is mainly conducted close to major urban centers and along roads connected to urban settlements both at large and small scale.
With your response, I realized how can the farming industry can use its strength to its fullest to lower the risks from its threats.
19/07/22, 04:32 - Unknown: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader. 
Also Sharon, along with the SWOT analysis of a company, I would appreciate it if you also share a SWOT analysis of yourself. I want to see how much more you have learned beyond this activity.

How are you doing?
21/07/22, 21:01 - Unknown: Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our *WEDNESDAY Wisdom* was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects

22/07/22, 17:46 - Sharon EWYL20E0280: This is a very interesting story,it has so much learning, teaching. 
L learnt quite a lot.
L learnt that failure is not an option regardless of the circumstances laid in front of you.
There's always a way out of failure to success that accept your responsibility, learn about your mistakes and do something about it.
22/07/22, 17:47 - Sharon EWYL20E0280: Truly everyone can always find blame in something but that only invites another failure indeed
23/07/22, 04:01 - Unknown: I read your response Sharon and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.

25/07/22, 02:28 - Sharon EWYL20E0280: One’s mindset is defined as the perception of achieving goals in both the professional and personal lives.Growth mindset is defined as someone who believes that they can learn and improve their basic abilities through effort and failures.

Successful people who possess growth mindset interpret failures and challenges as opportunities to grow and cultivate their existing qualities and talents. They strive for self-improvement

The growth mindset  stimulates one’s drive, willingness, and overall foundation of belief to achieve bigger and better outcomes and that's how successful are here called successful. 

For me to be a successful somebody l need certain things .l need to start with simple traits like changing my bad habits and focus on the process, not the results. Sometimes, the key to success is not giving up on a problem but overcoming it.

self-awareness and self-compassion are key features that help shape my growth mindset.They help one understand and balance their weaknesses, nurture their desire to grow, and eventually empower them to become happier in life and that's exactly what l need. 
For me to have a growth mindset l need to practice and put a lot of effort.
25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

26/07/22, 16:26 - Unknown: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

Yesterday I had an amazing day. I went to the airport to receive all my proud Edoofians and I had tears in my eyes seeing their happiness and enthusiasm. I want you to look at it and share your thoughts with me.
26/07/22, 17:53 - Sharon EWYL20E0280: Woooooow....this is really beautiful.
26/07/22, 17:54 - Sharon EWYL20E0280: Keep up the good work.
26/07/22, 18:46 - Unknown: This in reality was like a dream come true for me.
26/07/22, 18:47 - Unknown: Have a look at these too, beautiful pictures and happy faces.
26/07/22, 18:48 - Unknown: Along with this, I read your understanding of the activity Sharon and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it’s not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you’re looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don’t do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.
26/07/22, 22:35 - Sharon EWYL20E0280: Beautiful indeed.

It may be better to think about time management as a combination of working productively and prioritizing your time.

Our *Wednesday Wisdom* was all about Time Management and understanding the priority matrix to organize our tasks. 
I am really excited to hear your understanding and working on the same.
Please share it with me here.
In today's session we will talk about:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. progress on community building projects.
29/07/22, 07:03 - Sharon EWYL20E0280: L had said 2

How's your day going?
29/07/22, 20:58 - Unknown: Your response to the Wednesday wisdom has made me realize our childhood quote  is Money'.
Through Wednesday Wisdom, my main aim was to educate my Edoofians about TIME MANAGEMENT and HOW IT CAN BE ACHIEVED.
You know are very well aware of what Time management means, let me tell you about what Time Management includes:

#Effective Planning
# Setting goals and objectives
# Setting deadlines
# Delegation of responsibilities
# Prioritizing activities as per their importance
# Spending the right time on the right activity

The benefits of Time Management are:
- Time Management makes an individual punctual and disciplined.
- One becomes more organized as a result of effective Time Management.
- Individuals who stick to a time plan are the ones who realize their goals and objectives within the shortest possible period. 
- Research says that individuals who accomplish tasks on time are less prone to stress and anxiety. 

How can we achieve it:
# Set a goal for yourself.
# Priority matrix (like we talked about in the Wednesday lesson)
# Organize your study space
# Do a SWOT Analysis of yourself.

I am sure you will note all these things and imply in your day-to-day life and do share with me what changes you have felt.
