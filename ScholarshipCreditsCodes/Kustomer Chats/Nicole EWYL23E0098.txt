25/11/23, 17:12 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL
25/11/23, 17:27 - Nicole EWYL23E0098: Ok maam thank you
29/11/23, 17:39 - Nicole EWYL23E0098: Good afternoon maam
29/11/23, 17:40 - Nicole EWYL23E0098: I believe that competition is when you fight towards your goals
29/11/23, 17:48 - Nicole EWYL23E0098: Competition means that fighting against other students to win the first prize usually. 

It has helped me influence my approach to challenges and goals in life by the thought of having a mentor in my mind. My sister was kind of my mentor at the same time my role model which means that I would keep on reading and working hard so that l could  aim higher than her and therefore it was a spirit of competition in me

In life l have seen competition helping me in sports, l was an athlete and competition would help me to win gold medals and certificates.
29/11/23, 19:59 - Jasmine Kaur: Good, We will discuss this in our session.
Till then take care

01/12/23, 13:26 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes Yes, Let me go through it

Remember, healthy competition is a powerful tool for self-discovery and accomplishment. Keep leveraging it to reach new heights in all aspects of your life. Good Jon Nicole
01/12/23, 13:37 - Jasmine Kaur: How many schools have you visited so far?

01/12/23, 13:45 - Nicole EWYL23E0098: Noo,, am moving to other schools
01/12/23, 13:53 - Jasmine Kaur: Nicole, I think there is a need for better clarity.
In the context of Project 3, the African Schools Education Reform mission, your specific role involves visiting schools to collect information and providing a brief overview of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

It's crucial to emphasize that merely filling out the application form doesn't imply the school's agreement to connect with Edoofa.
01/12/23, 14:12 - Jasmine Kaur: Now it is time to wrap up the session.

Kindly go through the entire conversation that we have had till now.

02/12/23, 11:58 - Nicole EWYL23E0098: Am a proud Edofian 👏👏
02/12/23, 20:21 - Jasmine Kaur: _*Hello, my Proud Edoofian*_!

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

Best Regards
TEAM EWYL!
