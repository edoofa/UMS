13/08/22, 02:01 - Unknown: Good Sandra, I believe that finding your inspiration is one of the most crucial part of the process after hard work as it aims to enable you to have examples in life that you can learn form, get inspiration and motivation from, to work towards your own goals and become a success.
13/08/22, 02:01 - Unknown: However, we have to first skip fixating on failure and become confident about our own success.

16/08/22, 15:15 - Sandra EWYL21E0160: My wish is to be self motivated and inspired to stop fixing my eyes on the failures of the past but see myself as a victor and a successful entrepreneur , above all I want to learn to be self dependent.

18/07/22, 20:10 - Unknown: Yes i have read your read the response Sandra, you have written it very well.  However, by a swot analysis people mean a list of  strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea.
18/07/22, 20:10 - Unknown: That is the way to present it better to people and even during your job.
18/07/22, 20:38 - Sandra EWYL21E0160: Sorry sir but thank you for corrections
18/07/22, 20:59 - Unknown: Yes It is alright Sandra!
18/07/22, 20:59 - Unknown: As seen above, SWOT is an acronym of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. However, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym:

Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by
18/07/22, 21:04 - Sandra EWYL21E0160: Noted sir?
18/07/22, 21:17 - Unknown: Now, What Are the Biggest SWOT Analysis Mistakes?
18/07/22, 21:21 - Sandra EWYL21E0160: They are not always accurate
18/07/22, 23:10 - Unknown: You know why SWOT Analysis is important? It can help you to challenge risky assumptions and to uncover dangerous blindspots about your organization's performance. If you use it carefully and collaboratively, it can deliver new insights on where your business currently is, and help you to develop exactly the right strategy for any situation.

For example, you may be well aware of some of your organization's strengths, but until you record them alongside weaknesses and threats you might not realize how unreliable those strengths actually are.
18/07/22, 23:10 - Unknown: Equally, you likely have reasonable concerns about some of your business weaknesses but, by going through the analysis systematically, you could find an opportunity, previously overlooked, that could more than compensate.
19/07/22, 00:33 - Sandra EWYL21E0160: Thank you sir?
