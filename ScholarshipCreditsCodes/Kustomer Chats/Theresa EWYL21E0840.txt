14/12/22, 00:14 - Unknown: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Line. Here we practice a 'mantra' where you should always start and end the day by saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' to boost your energy!

14/12/22, 00:41 - Theresa EWYL21E0840: I'm proud to be an Edoofian
14/12/22, 00:42 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

17/12/22, 20:15 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift nor an expensive one. More often then not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them. I have also seen some of us pen down our emotions into a beautiful piece of poetry for them. The act of gifting is a beautiful act, one where the giver also receives something special — the receiver’s happiness. When we spend a lot of effort in finding that perfect gift to surprise our loved ones, we can actually see the delight in the receiver’s eyes.

We discussed Secret Santa on Wednesday; as part of your Saturday assignment, I would like you to make a submission of 250 words outlining Whose Secret Santa you would like to be this Christmas and what gift you would like to give them and why?

Be as candid as honest as you can, and don't hold back! I will be looking forward to your response.

Happy learning!

Hope you are doing well.

Christmas is less than a week away, and we are all ready to relive the warmth of the holiday love. Spend time with them, eat delicious cuisine, and cultivate your relationships. Everybody in the world anticipates this time of year. Some of our students who are now studying in India recently connected with Ms. Davi, and they talked about how they celebrated Christmas back home.⛪️?☃️

I am eager to learn how you want to ring in the new year and enjoy Christmas this year❄️????
Please share with me your favourite Christmas time memories, any associated images, and any traditions you follow. This will undoubtedly be a very interesting discussion.

Wish you a joyous time ahead??❄️
22/12/22, 00:11 - Unknown: A very good afternoon Theresa!
22/12/22, 00:33 - Unknown: I am caught up with a very important meeting with the Team today so we couldn't have a session today, however, do go through the Lesson and share with me your favorite memories and traditions.
22/12/22, 15:38 - Theresa EWYL21E0840: The sight of mango tree flowers being in bloom makes people giddy with excitement because everyone knows that arriving together with the precious fruit is Christmas the biggest holiday of all. Christmas in Zimbabwe is a special and exciting season despite because it starts from the 1st of December. Billboards, TV ads and newspapers all start showcasing Christmas wishes. For the movie fans , the Christmas movie marathon begins. At our home Christmas is usually celebrated in the rural areas. We used to go there because that was where my paternal grandmother stayed but now she is no more but people still celebrate Christmas there. My favourite Christmas memory was when my grandmother was still alive. The whole family ie all my aunts, uncles and cousins would be there. Because my grandmother would be happy she would slaughter a pig 2 to 3 days before Christmas and the men of the family will sort it. When we came from Harare, we would bring a lot of groceries and other things with us and my gran would provide the meat. On Christmas morning, the church service would be first and this was usually done in the early morning. After the service people would go back home and the daughters-in-law in would do the cooking. The men of the family will be in charge of braaing the meat. The Christmas meal is known to be very large and filling. Eating with family while laughing and reminiscing events of the year is always the best thing. However for the youth's this was not all. After eating lunch, the young at heart would go to the shopping centre and have all sorts of fun. Those from the city will be catching up with their friends from the village. This will also be a fashion show in disguise as people will be wearing new clothes from the city. The elderly, especially men would be at house beer parties enjoying themselves. My favourite event of the day would be when my uncles came back home drunk late in the evening. He would be saying all sorts of funny things and most im

23/12/22, 17:24 - Unknown: A very good morning Theresa.
23/12/22, 17:24 - Unknown: Greetings Proud Edoofians,

We are firm believers that we need to help break the silence, raise awareness and change negative social norms surrounding menstrual hygiene in the world, so that women and girls feel empowered to manage their periods safely, hygienically, with confidence, and without embarrassment. To spread awareness about this fact steps needed to be taken.

To that, we welcome you to take the initiative to put forth the first step. It is about the Sirona Project that was discussed yesterday in the meeting. You are going to be using the platform Youtube. It is a very big platform that if used correctly makes news spread like wildfire. We have taken a combined initiative to spread awareness about women’s hygiene so we will start with Youtube. The likes, shares, and duration of a video watched contribute to the factor which is needed to spread such awareness.

“ https:\/\/youtu.be\/oYXzCiHkWIs “

Here is a small video encouraging each viewer to stop period shaming. A core integral structure related to menstrual hygiene. Thereby, as part of your activity, inclusion of your attention throughout the 30-second video is necessary to wander watching you’re encouraged to share it with a minimum of 10 friends and family. At the same time, you are needed to implore them to watch the video fully such as you. Hence, the use of platforms for sharing such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram is compulsory. Also, you are required to take a screenshot of your activities and contribution to this project and send it to your respective mentors.

I wish you all good health and I am enthusiastic to see the due diligence of your contribution to this assignment.
23/12/22, 17:25 - Unknown: Here I have shared with you the first project task of the Sirona Project.
23/12/22, 23:25 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofians, 

Since you are the part of a very important project that is  highlighting how critical it is to raise awareness about women's hygiene. By watching the YouTube videos and sharing them with at least 10 of your friends and family, you would be assisting us in this. This will encourage the use of social media apps like Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp

https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oMTFaan7M9c

The link above will help you comprehend the significance of menstruation hygiene by showing how women no longer have to rely on uncomfortable sanitary pads and can now use Sirona menstrual cups for more convenient, rash-free options. Please provide your mentors a screenshot of your contributions to your activities after you have completed them.

We're here to help you show how committed and capable you are by making contributions to the project.
23/12/22, 23:25 - Unknown: Deadline for above two task is Sunday!

12/01/23, 01:15 - Unknown: I was feeling unwell the past few days but I am much better today and since today is Wednesday, I will be sharing with you the Wednesday Lesson now



Hello My proud Edoofian, 

Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals towards achieving this goal. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

I would appreciate you sharing your learnings from today’s lesson. 

Happy learning!

22/10/22, 18:03 - Unknown: Hello, My Proud Edoofian.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.

This lesson is going to be a true example of the phrase, \"Humility is a virtue\", which in today's time is recognized by many, but followed by a few.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

10/11/22, 17:50 - Unknown: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian,

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.
