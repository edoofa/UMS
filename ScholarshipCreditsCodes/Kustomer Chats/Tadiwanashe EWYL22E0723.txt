24/12/22, 04:37 - Aditi Kapoor: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

The feedback we have received from some of you on this week’s Wednesday lesson is really amazing. While some of you heard this term for the first time, others were excited to learn about the glimpse of the internal growth strategies of businesses. A North Star metric is a singular, measurable goal that businesses use to guide their decision-making and track their progress toward success. As a student, you can also benefit from setting a North Star metric for yourself. This could be a goal that aligns with your personal and academic aspirations and guides your decision-making in pursuing them.
As part of this week’s Saturday Activity, you are required to share your written submission on : 
What is a North Star Metric, and how does it help businesses stay focused on their goals? 
As a student, what could be a good North Star Metric for you to guide your academic and personal growth?
There is no word limit, so feel free to express your understanding in detail. The second answer requires some mental work, so sit with yourself, introspect, and share your honest answer with your mentor. 
Let this activity play an important role in your personal goal setting. We will connect soon in our upcoming session. 
Till then, happy learning and happy growing!","transform":"

13/03/23, 19:59 - Aditi Kapoor: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”
