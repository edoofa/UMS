I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.

Giving a gift to our loved ones is a beautiful act, where you spend your heart and mind to give the other person something special. This need not always be a physical gift or an expensive one. More often than not it is simply the effort taken to spend time on them.

In this session on the *EWYL Line*, we will talk about who would you want to be your secret Santa and why?
Please excuse me for yesterday, I was with Ms. Deepali for an important meeting.
20/12/22, 22:04 - Aditi Kapoor: Along with this, since I have students who are going to school and many Indian students are also occupied with their classes and exams, I wanted to give all my students some flexibility so that they have their sessions with me and I am there to address all their concerns.
So, your batch is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from 11:30 AM-02:30 PM.

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday. 

1) Your sessions will be held on the EWYL Line.
2) In a session, we discuss your:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.
4) The _purpose of EWYL Group_ is for *tracking your progress and important notifications, not for response submissions.*
5) Every day you have to come on the EWYL Line and follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'.?️

23/12/22, 23:58 - Evidence EWYL22E0440: From our Wednesday lesson of this week, I learnt a lot of things done on Christmas in African countries.
*Zimbabwe*
Usually Christmas in Zimbabwe starts with a church service in the morning. People dress in their special clothes. They decorate houses nicely for Christmas and people eat good food.
*Zambia*
Again in Zambia they start with church services and religious activities. People wear special clothes. They share gifts and have special dinners.
*South Africa*
Some visit country side to enjoy summer sun. Those who live in cities and towns organize to have braai on their gardens and verandas. They usually favor South African babarque. 
*Kenya*
People wear special clothes. They eat their special meals. They gather in numbers and family members sing and dance around the fire.
23/12/22, 23:58 - Evidence EWYL22E0440: Yes I have created a LinkedIn account
24/12/22, 21:17 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings _my Proud Edoofian_!

The holiday season is upon us and it’s time to light up the Christmas trees and indulge ourselves in the festivities. I assume due to the Christmas and New year seasons everyone is in a buoyant mood?

 Well, then I implore you to avail this time to spend with your family and friends. We are announcing holidays from today, 24th December 2022 to till 2nd January 2023. You are required to report on 3rd January 2023. ? 
Go out with friends to parties, eat with no concern, go to a church or set up Christmas at your home. Have a Christmas and New Year of your desire. Then come back with much more energy as your EWYL team has planned a very fruitful year ahead of you.

Many more projects, more skills to master, more exposure to new companies, more knowledge, and more surprises. :gift-box: 

 Are you excited? Well, let the passion in you burn as we are waiting for you to come back stronger. Let’s make a new resolution to new ventures with discoveries that are waiting to happen.

How are you doing?

Problem-solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem-solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals toward achieving this goal.

So can you please share what are your views on:
1) Wednesday lesson
2) progress on the projects
12/01/23, 20:53 - Aditi Kapoor: I have not received any update from you on the lesson and activity. May I know how are you planning to do?

5 Problem solving strategies from Charlie Munger.

1. Simplify.
It is usually best to simplify problems by deciding big 'no-brainer' questions first.

2.  Numerical Fluency.
Galelio's conclusion that scientific reality is often revealed only by math. Galelio's attitude also works well in messy practical life.
Without numerical Fluency in the part of life most of us inhabit, you are like a one legged man in an Ass kicking contest 

3. Invert 
Inverting the problem won't always solve it, but it will help you avoid trouble call it the avoiding stupidity filter.

4. Study the Basics
The basics are something that keeps coming up.

5. Lollapalooza effects.
Big effects will only come from large combinations of factors.

From Charlie, we learn that 
\" Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Systematically you get ahead but not necessarily in fast spurts. Nevertheless, you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts. Say it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day if you live loving enough most people get what they deserve.\"

When I was at work, my working partner used to smoke cigarettes. I was not comfortable with the air pollution made from the cigarette smoke. I asked myself how I can solve this problem so that I can save his health and avoid air pollution.
I downloaded some pictures of affected lungs on google. I showed him how smoking. Now working with this guy is enjoyable. I applied Lollapalooza effects from Munger.

How was your weekend?

 The ability to solve problems is a basic life skill and is essential to our day-to-day lives, at home, at school, and at work. We solve problems every day without really thinking about how we solve them. 
We talked about a situation and its probable ending.

In our session today:
1) how would you continue the situation as stated in the Weekend activity?
2) progress on the projects
16/01/23, 21:26 - Aditi Kapoor: Also, I want to remind you of three important things that often skips from our mind.
1) the daily ritual needs to be followed *only on the EWYL Line.*
2) responses to the weekend activity and Wednesday lesson won't be accepted if they are shared on the EWY Group, they need to be shared *only on the EWYL Line.*
3) any forms that you receive for the community building project, share them on the *EWYL Group.*
16/01/23, 21:26 - Aditi Kapoor: Moreover, we have a revised form for the community building project.
Please use this form only from tomorrow onwards, otherwise, they won't be counseled.

18/01/23, 21:24 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Evidence!
How are you?
18/01/23, 21:24 - Aditi Kapoor: This is superb Evidence, outstanding results!
18/01/23, 21:25 - Aditi Kapoor: I would like to congratulate you for clearing all your A-Level subjects and getting these good grades, surely your hard work paid off. 

I'm sure the family must also be very proud of your efforts and the results. 

I would encourage you to share these results in your admission group as well so that your admissions officer can connect with you to discuss the next step in your admission process. 

Please be patient and I would like to share that the only mode of communication should be sending your result slips on your admissions group, texting your Admission officer personally might delay your conversation.

Hope you are doing well.

While listening is an important skill, the art of asking questions is equally, if not more, important when it comes to learning more about your work tasks, unlocking hidden opportunities, delivering better results, and mitigating unforeseen risks. 
We have five guidelines to keep or to start asking good questions.

We discuss the following things:
1) what did you learn about it
2) progress on projects

20/01/23, 16:07 - Evidence EWYL22E0440: Greetings Ms Saloni, kindly forgive me I missed my session yesterday as I was at work.


From the newsletter I learnt that during my 20s, for me to be successful in life I should start doing this:
Spending time with people who are not in their 20s
Getting rid of friends who are not going anywhere in life because you are a direct reflection of the people around you.at the same time you don't need to be mean.
Keep on reading so that you will gain wisdom left years ago
Find a mentor, everyone in their 20s. It Should never cause you to make short sighted decision
