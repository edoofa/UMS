30/01/23, 22:43 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up.

02/02/23, 03:46 - Zvikomborero EWYL22E0062: I remember my first ever national exam was really scary because I got sick during that period . However through the support I got from my family ,friends and teachers i managed to get 4 units . Secondary school also had its own hurdles since schools got closed because of the pandemic Covid 19 . Through tutoring and constant studying in the lock down  I produces 4A's , 5B's  and 2C's in  my  O level. For my A level i got an opportunity to learn at boarding school with a strong reading culture . It was a good experience both mentally and socially , teaching me how to be able to live independently. For my A levels I got 11 points and a pass in communication  skills.                                                                                           I would like to think  that i am a social butterfly and really good at communicating with different kinds of people  . I am a very soft hearted person and I love doing volunteer work     and spreading hope to other people and i learnt all of this in a club called Ray of Hope . I also have a passion for cooking      and singing .                                                                                                                                                              Being a successful  Chattered Accountant   is a goal  that I am very passionate about  and I hope I can further my dream to  the best extent of my capabilities . I also hope to continue with charity and volunteer work so that I can help other people achieve their goals, and also be able to inspire the upcoming generation and my peers  .

Corporate alliance will help prepare me for the professional industry helping us to gain knowledge business wise before we start working it also help us with creating strong professional connection with different companies .I think that Community building is about helping to improve the community and give other students the same chance i got. African school education reform mission project is about helping improve African education  through connecting them to Edoofa and sharing world class technology and technologies available in I india . All of th above also help sharpening our communication skills.

13/02/23, 18:33 - Unknown: One morning, an elderly man was walking along the beach when he noticed a young boy picking something off the sand and throwing it into the sea.

As he got closer, the man realized the child was throwing stranded starfishes that had washed up on the shore back into the breaking waves.

Approaching the boy, the man asked what he was doing.

“The starfish will die if they’re still on the shore when the sun rises,” he replied.

Perplexed, the old man said, “But that’s pointless! There are countless miles of beach and thousands of starfish. It doesn’t matter how many you return to the water, you can’t make a difference.”

Unfazed, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish, and tossed it into the sea.

“It matters to this one,” he said.","transform":"

Thanks for asking
13/02/23, 22:47 - Unknown: Now, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
13/02/23, 22:47 - Zvikomborero EWYL22E0062: Ok Sir
13/02/23, 22:55 - Zvikomborero EWYL22E0062: I'm done  Sir
13/02/23, 22:59 - Unknown: Okay, so very quickly, Can you summarise whatever you learnt in the audio for me? 
Just so we’re on the same page about it.
13/02/23, 23:13 - Zvikomborero EWYL22E0062: Ok So i learnt that what i will be doing is developing the skills necessary for what i want to do at an early stage  so i will need to identify companies  the company in my country that suits the category and also start from mt social cirles, family and community informing them about Edoofa and how  it is helping me achieve my goals by  learning the necessary skills  and that i should create a linkedin profile and communicate with different companies and various company managers about Edoofa and set up meetings with them and Edoofa
13/02/23, 23:14 - Zvikomborero EWYL22E0062: This does not only help me but it also helps me to create an impact in my economy

14/02/23, 00:44 - Zvikomborero EWYL22E0062: So from the document i understood the necessary steps to use when searching for companies a i understood that i have to understand the nurture of the company  and that it should be student centric , recreatiinal or  content centric i should also check for  scale of the company  , financial stability and the founders background it also stated the platforms that can be used to do what i mentioned above and how to use them for example LinkedIn is one of the platforms
14/02/23, 01:26 - Unknown: I am sure that you must have noticed that this document wants to help us make sure that we look for the right type of companies and for us to do that we must keep a few factors into consideration which are 
1. the nature of the company 
2. Scale of the company 
3. Financial stability of the company 
4. Background of the founder of the company 

I would like you to explain in detail these above-mentioned factors.
