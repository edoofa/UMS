04/11/22, 00:20 - Unknown: I am doing very well edoofian
04/11/22, 00:20 - Unknown: *I BELIEVE IN YOU*,
I hope that you are familiar with the Indian education system.The modern curriculum comprises a holistic learning approach and doesn't just limit itself to core subjects. Universities now tend to focus more on acquiring skills in technology, communication, critical thinking and problem solving. 

There is also enough emphasis on cultural studies and society. These aspects help you understand the problems that many communities face and they get an idea as to how they can use their knowledge for the betterment of the same.
There is also an equal emphasis on extracurricular activities to help build your personality and improve your innate strengths
Now, I have a small task for you all. I want you all to write a review about what your reviews are regarding edoofa and Indian education. Make sure you make me proud and share a screenshot here today itself. I have attached a review manual manual which explains how to write a *GOOGLE REVIEW and FACEBOOK REVIEW*.

NOTE  have to share 2 screenshots each [ one facebook review and one google review ]
20/11/22, 15:59 - Nigel EWYL22E0310: Good morning.
20/11/22, 19:12 - Unknown: Good day edoofian ,
Hope everything is well at your end!



I would like to share a brief message about the importance of planning in our lives and as an organization as well!


Planning is definitely significant as it directs us where to go, it furnishes direction and decreases the danger of risk by making predictions. The significant advantages of planning are provided below:
Planning provides directions: Planning assures that the objectives are certainly asserted so that they serve as a model for determining what action should be taken and in which direction. If objects are well established, employees are informed of what the company has to do and what they need do to accomplish those purposes.
Planning decreases the chances of risk: Planning is an activity which permits a manager to look forward and predict changes. By determining in prior the tasks to be completed, planning notes the way to deal with changes and unpredictable effects.
Planning decreases overlapping and wasteful activities: Planning works as the foundation of organising the activities and purposes of distinct branches, departments, and people. It assists in avoiding chaos and confusion. Since planning guarantees precision in understanding and action, work is conducted on easily without delays.

21/11/22, 21:07 - Unknown: Hello my proud edoofian, hope you had a great weekend!
Also, I wanted to communicate one thing with all my students
To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer and your EWYL Mentor.
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages. Let us get a better understanding of the three stages!
21/11/22, 21:09 - Nigel EWYL22E0310: Ok go on
22/11/22, 00:33 - Unknown: Your *counselor* is your first point of contact. Your counselor has been guiding you during your onboarding process where you learnt about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same.
        After that, you are contacted by your *Admissions Officer* {Miss Vilsha\/Mr. Milan}.I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now you must be aware that all your admissions related queries like: your VISA process, Registration fees, AAL etc. would be addressed\/handled by the Admissions Team.
Note: Your EWYL mentor\/counselor will not be addressing your admission queries
22/11/22, 00:58 - Nigel EWYL22E0310: Ok l understand that.
