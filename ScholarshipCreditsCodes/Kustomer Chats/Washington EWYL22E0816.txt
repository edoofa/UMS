I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
28/01/23, 00:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.

- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter

Please read through it and share with me a short summary of what you have learnt from it.
31/01/23, 20:29 - Washington EWYL22E0816: The Document gives us the Guide for searching companies. In the document we are also given some websites to use while searching for these combanies. These companies should be student-Centric or could be recreational. Also the scale of the company should not be too small or too big (between 50-200 employees). The companies must be financially sound. The most suitable companies are those with founders with good back grounds. Google, linkedin and crunchbase are some of the platforms that can be used. We are also given steps to follow along with keeping the given factors into consideration. Every edoofian should follow all the steps given inorder to come up with the project.
01/02/23, 00:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's connect tomorrow for the updates.

I will be sharing the Wednesday wisdom with you tomorrow!

02/02/23, 18:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Coming to your concern you shared yesterday.
Yes, you can get such companies.
Simply write on Google, 'Small-scale technological equipment companies in Zimbabwe\/Zambia\/Nigeria\/African Countries'
After this, you will get multiple results and then look out for any company that you think can be a perfect fit to be partnered with us, just surf for that company on Google and LinkedIn and make sure you get all the things noted and information gathered.
02/02/23, 18:53 - Saloni Rastogi: *Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:

Linkedin ID\/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
02/02/23, 18:56 - Washington EWYL22E0816: These companies should be from Africa or World Wide?
02/02/23, 20:45 - Saloni Rastogi: 1. Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies.
2. The company can be African or Indian. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The target audience of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media\/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should not belong to these particular sectors:

02/02/23, 21:06 - Washington EWYL22E0816: From the Wednesday Wisdom I received Yesterday I understand that there are many reasons for conneting with people. There are also advantages that are gained by students through the use of Linkedin. Some of the benefits include having opportunities to find groups, looking for employers to ask more about the industry, many businesses are advertised on the linkedin platform and so on. Also adhering to lessons and engaging in Saturday activities will aid in professional development and this helps be better equiped for future path.
