14/10/23, 14:17 - Unknown: Hello, OmegaðŸ’«
I hope you had a productive week and enjoyed our lesson on Wednesday.

As part of our ongoing commitment to personal growth and self-improvement, I'd like you to take a moment to reflect on the key takeaways from the lesson. Identify one specific goal you want to achieve based on our discussions. Be sure to make it SMART. Lastly, identify one significant distraction that you are willing to remove or reduce to bolster your focus and productivity.

Let's reconvene next week to discuss our progress, share our experiences, and support each other in our personal development journeys. I look forward to hearing from you and working together to achieve our goals.

Best regards,
TEAM EWYL

I hope you are doing well.

Kindly excuse me for the delay in reply, my working hours were over by the time you texted. 
Yes, I am aware about your examinations getting started and I wish you all the very best for the same. 

Since I wantyou to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could put our sessions on hold you focus on your exams.
18/10/23, 14:10 - Unknown: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:

I parent of , *<NAME>*, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME>  would like to inform you that *Student* won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because of exams that start from _ to __ (date) and she/he will reach out to my mentor, *Ms. Sharda* as soon as the exams get over.

Send it to - Sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and sharda.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
18/10/23, 14:10 - Unknown: I wanted to let you know that today's Wednesday lesson is going to be a special one. We'll be delving into a captivating story that revolves around the themes of skill, hard work, and determination.

The moral of this story is a powerful one, and it's a lesson that we can carry with us throughout our lives: "Sometimes the truest treasures lay not in the allure of gold but in the craftsmanship and effort one invests in their work." This story will remind us of the value of dedication and the importance of striving for excellence in everything we do.

So, come prepared to listen, learn, and be inspired by this tale of determination and the rewards it can bring. We'll discuss the story, its characters, and the valuable lesson it imparts.

See you in our upcoming session, and let's explore the world of skill, hard work, and the true treasures that lie within our reach.

Best regards,
Team EWYL!
