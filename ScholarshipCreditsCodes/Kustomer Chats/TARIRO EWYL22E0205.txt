13/07/22, 16:27 - Jasmine Kaur: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

On Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
Sounds interesting, right?
16/07/22, 18:25 - Jasmine Kaur: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,

Happy learning Edoofian!
20/07/22, 03:39 - TARIRO EWYL22E0205: This Wednesday wisdom lesson was very beneficial to me as l was able to learn that hard work pays and also follow your dreams regardless 


My father owns a shop in Avondale and he is the one who motivated me to be who lam today 
I got exposed to the business world at such a young age because l would normally go to his work place every Saturday when lam free and also now l go there after my lessons and the marketing manager there (Junior) she teaches me on how to make quotations using Quickbooks and ever since then l have been obsessed with doing business because it is something that l like whole heatedly

21/07/22, 16:20 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my proud hope you are doing well,. We are back with another Wednesday wisdom. I am sure you will agree to the fact that Attitude plays a major role in our day-to-day life. It is also a waste of time if the proper attitude and effective abilities are not developed. In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we discuss a crucial character quality that everyone should work on and make sure they have mastered the right attitude. Once you have read the full lesson, We will be having the discussion concerning the same in our next session. Write down if you have any questions or key observations from the lesson. 

Happy learning!
21/07/22, 16:21 - Jasmine Kaur: I am very well, thanks for asking.
25/07/22, 03:15 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

29/07/22, 16:09 - TARIRO EWYL22E0205: This documantation was very useful because we easily judge people for these they did not do maybe they where at the wrong time and place but we end up blaming them just like how that sailor blamed the sea for his ship wreck when it was actually the bad winds that caused the wreck 

So the moral of the strory: don't let others demotivate you if they blame you for what you did not do therefore try to tell them your side of story and let nature take it's course
29/07/22, 18:50 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings my proud edoofian,
I hope you are having a productive day.
29/07/22, 18:50 - Jasmine Kaur: I will help you cover everything, do not worry.
Also, how were your exams?
29/07/22, 18:51 - Jasmine Kaur: We will learn about time management firstly.
29/07/22, 19:16 - TARIRO EWYL22E0205: The exams were a bit challenging
29/07/22, 19:16 - TARIRO EWYL22E0205: Ok lam ready

29/07/22, 22:10 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay
29/07/22, 22:11 - Jasmine Kaur: Many successful people have different approaches that got them to where they are today. But the one thing they have in common is that they know how to juggle high-level projects and make sure they spend the bulk of their time on the tasks that are most conducive to their success.
29/07/22, 22:43 - TARIRO EWYL22E0205: Yessunderstoood ma'am
29/07/22, 23:16 - Jasmine Kaur: In my opinion time management is on you,
Time management is about being about to designate time to complete everything that you need to do, and assigning the 24 hours you have every day to the right task. If you can effectively pair up your time and the things on your to-do list, you will be able to operate at the foundational level of success. How you spend your day is up to you, whether you’re working on a project or you’re watching television all day, you’re responsible for designating your time wisely.
