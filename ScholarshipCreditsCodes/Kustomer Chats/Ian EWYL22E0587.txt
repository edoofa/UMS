Welcome to the EWYL Line :fireworks:
06/01/23, 01:32 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the very best, and please have this with you that I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction. 
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
06/01/23, 01:32 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects that we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and put effort to make it a _learning and earning experience_.
06/01/23, 01:33 - Saloni Rastogi: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.

How are you?
06/01/23, 21:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' for today.
06/01/23, 21:09 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
06/01/23, 21:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, please choose a project for the month of January that you will be focusing on.

How are you?
18/01/23, 17:51 - Saloni Rastogi: I am sharing with you last Wednesday's lesson and related weekend activity with you.
Please let me know in case you face any challenges.
18/01/23, 17:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My proud Edoofian, 

Problem-solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem-solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals toward achieving this goal. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem-solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

I would appreciate you sharing your learnings from today’s lesson. 

Happy learning!
18/01/23, 17:53 - Saloni Rastogi: This is the Wednesday lesson.
18/01/23, 17:54 - Saloni Rastogi: Hope you and everyone in your family is also doing good!

 The ability to solve problems is a basic life skill and is essential to our day-to-day lives, at home, at school, and at work. We solve problems every day without really thinking about how we solve them. For example: it’s raining and you need to go to the store. What do you do? There are lots of possible solutions. Take your umbrella and walk. If you don't want to get wet, you can drive, or take the bus. There is no right way to solve this problem and different people will solve it differently. However in our Wednesday wisdom we learnt about some Problem solving strategies. As part of your Saturday activity, I want you to share with us a problem that you encountered very recently and how did you Solve It. Did you use any strategy that was similar to what Munger has talked about?

Looking forward to your responses!
18/01/23, 17:54 - Saloni Rastogi: This is the weekend activity.

Hope you are well.

Please excuse me for the delay caused in the discussion for the lesson, I was occupied in an internal meeting with the team and then we had our lunch quickly. But the meeting requires some input from my end too and it is still to be continued so I won't be available to take the sessions today. But nothing to worry about, we will continue tomorrow from 09:30 AM-12:00 PM⚡
Till then, share your updates in the format I am sharing with you so that when I will reach out to you tomorrow for updates, there will be a quick summary.
