It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Hope you’re doing well. We know most of you have your exams going on since we got a lot of emails to continue after the exams. While we appreciate that students like you are taking on the responsibility to be accountable for your unavailability, we need to ensure that the emails shared have to be in the right format. 
Email writing is a skill that each professional must possess. An email should be written with an intent to share information formally with your colleagues\/seniors\/mentors etc. 
In today’s activity, we want you to write an email sharing your exam schedule and your date of rejoining the EWYL sessions. 
Also attach your exam schedule\/date sheet as a part of the email.

For the one’s who are yet to start with their exams or don’t have them ongoing, write an email addressing your mentor about what has been their contribution in shaping your career so far and one thing that you want to learn from them. Please mention specific information.

Please feel free to discuss if you have any queries with your mentors. 
You have to email it to : deepali@edoofa.com

“My job is not to be easy on people. My job is to make them better.”- Steve Jobs

And till now, our founder Mr. Angad has always been a guiding light for everyone at Edoofa. And has made sure we all turn out to be future leaders in our fields, no matter how hard it seems, we should keep moving with single harmony toward our goals and motives. But, leadership can not only be taught, as it is not a literary subject, but a practical life experience that is to be taken up and practiced and bettered with each passing day.

Hence, after the very encouraging Wednesday lesson on how good leadership and patience can change the entire ideology and perception of a community to grow back from the ashes. Today's Activity is going to give you a first-hand experience to fit yourselves in a small part of the leadership shoes. I want you to create a newsletter of your own. Similar to the ones you have enjoyed reading every Sunday from the founder's office.

Your Newsletter should consider the following things:  Quotes that have been motivating you for some time now, or your three favorite quotes which motivate you to be better every day.
and,
2. One story of your idol, that can be any person, who according to you has contributed to making the community and world a better place for people to live. The story should also consist of a part stating the reason why they are your idol.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own capabilities while performing this activity.

The best newsletters of the week shall be shared with all the fellow edoofians next week.

Have a wonderful weekend ahead.

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.
