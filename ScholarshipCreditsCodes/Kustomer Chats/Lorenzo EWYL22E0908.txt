02/12/23, 16:43 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL
02/12/23, 20:20 - Aditi Kapoor: _*Hello, my Proud Edoofian*_!

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

Share your winter wonderland dreams!Let us know how you plan to make the most of this magical time of the year!
04/12/23, 15:30 - Lorenzo EWYL22E0908: The spirit of competition refers to a competitive attitude or mindset, which can be characterized by a desire to win, outdo others, or be the best. It can also be seen as a drive to excel or succeed in a given task or activity. This spirit can be beneficial in certain situations, such as sports or academic competitions, where it can motivate individuals to strive for excellence. However, it can also be unhealthy when it leads to feelings of jealousy, insecurity, or a lack of sportsmanship. A healthy approach to competition involves striving for personal improvement rather than focusing solely on winning.
04/12/23, 15:36 - Aditi Kapoor: Happy Monday! ðŸŒ¸
