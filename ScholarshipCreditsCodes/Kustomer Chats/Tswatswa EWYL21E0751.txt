27/10/22, 19:10 - Unknown: Hello, My Dear Proud Edoofian.

We all know that \"History is Written by Winners\", but not everybody knows the discipline, dedication, sacrifices, time, and efforts put behind it.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the kind of mindset a winner possesses, and about the person who carved his way from the bottom to the top, and even beyond. The story of a basketball player turning into a lethal black mamba on the court, the habits he formed, and the mindset he forged, to turn into a winner, is inspirational and the most practical way to better oneself every single day. You will learn a lot of different things from this lesson, about the attitude, instinct, and character of a true all-round winner.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.
Deadline for Submission: Friday 9 PM
Happy Learning.

11/01/23, 21:33 - Unknown: \"Sell me this pen.\" That might just be the best sales one-liner in history.

Over the last 10 years, I've seen many sales leaders use this question as part of their interview process to whittle out the \"can-dos\" from the \"can-nots.\" 

It's a favorite amongst sales professionals, from used car salespeople to Wall Street wolves. And for good reason — it's an exciting, accessible way to test a salesperson's fundamentals. How someone responds to those four words can tell you a lot about how — and how well — a candidate is going to perform in his\/her job. 

Let's try to respond to this prominent question as part of your Saturday submission. Your response must be shared in at least 150 words. 

I'm anticipating a highly original and creative response from your end.
11/01/23, 21:38 - Tswatswa EWYL21E0751: Okay sir
11/01/23, 22:02 - Unknown: I hope to connect with you regularly for our session from now on

12/01/23, 06:43 - Unknown: Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals towards achieving this goal. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

12/07/22, 23:07 - Unknown: Well, the answer lies in the way you keep up the conversation. 
Let us suppose if I am reaching out to you for the very first time, do I share everything about the EWYL projects and introduce myself in a blunt manner, or do I first introduce myself, ask you about your availability and then keep the conversation interactive while explaining the projects?

Patrice Motsepe  worked so hard to insure that his future is bright , though he became a lawyer he stopped at nothing until his dream of mining business came into reality . This story of Motsepe encourages youths like me to work very hard because we can change the world if we put aside our laziness and have perseverance . Now Motsepe is one of the richest African men because of his hard work , also one thing that  l liked from this is that Patrice waited patiently for his time to enjoy the profits . Honestly I'm really honored to have known much about our African entrepreneurs whom we will always remember because of their hard  work ,  l hope l will also do the same in my life .

That is why our head coach, Ms. Davi, tries that through every lesson you are able to get one step closer towards gaining these traits and making your career sucessful.

17/07/22, 17:21 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Date of Update: 11 July 2022
Work Done on Project 1: l have sent emails and Inmails to company authorities and some are not responding to the messages so l am planning of doing the physical interactions with them .
Work Done on Project 2: under the African Schools Reform project l have gathered all the headmaster's contacts from Makoni District . I went to Makoni District Ministry of Primary and Secondary education and l was given the contact details of several high school headmasters .l have been sending some messages to the headmasters and some are replying but the majority does not give any response .
Work Done on Project 3: under this project l am waiting for A level students to write their final examinations because many of them are saying they can't embark on a scholarship program right now because it can slow down their progress .
Challenges that you are facing: the biggest challenge l am facing is that the school authorities together with the decision makers of local organizations are not replying to my messages  .
18/07/22, 19:18 - Unknown: Great!

As August Intake is right at our doorsteps, So due to this many of our Edoofians will be arriving here in India to kick start their dream journey.?

I feel that it is my duty to make sure that the university has prepared well for their onboarding process.

This is why I would be visiting the universities Today in order to do a personal check up.
Since, This process would take up lots of time that is why we won't be able to connect Today.
However, I am sure that in my absence, You will make sure that you follow the below given things:

1. Make sure to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual at 9 AM Tomorrow.
2. Do submit the Wednesday Lesson before the deadline.

25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
