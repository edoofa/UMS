06/05/23, 12:20 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: It's lovely how Zimbabweans still managed to celebrate independence day far away from home with the help of all the other Indians there

12/05/23, 15:33 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: But how does one broaden a student community
12/05/23, 15:39 - Unknown: Hi, are you ready for your session?
12/05/23, 15:40 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: Yes I am Mr. Maurice
12/05/23, 15:46 - Unknown: Great!
To answer your question, I would like to know if you are still familiar with the community building project?
12/05/23, 15:52 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: Is it the one where I tell my friends and family  about Edoofa and getting them to connect with you.....as well as heads from various schools?
12/05/23, 15:56 - Unknown: Yes the one with the school is the Project 3, however I would like you to start working on a project today
12/05/23, 15:59 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: The one in which I spread the word?
12/05/23, 16:00 - Unknown: That is the community building project! I want you to address the projects by the project names so that you don't forget it too!
12/05/23, 16:01 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: Noted.
12/05/23, 16:06 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: Well thing is I started working on the community project some few months ago but the challenge is the majority already know about edoofa....some are already going to school and my social circle is so so small so I can't reach out to more people
12/05/23, 16:07 - Unknown: Well Rutendo I appreciate your efforts and if you think this project can be challenging, there are 2 more projects you can work on
12/05/23, 16:08 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: So should I start working on those projects now?
12/05/23, 16:14 - Unknown: Yes definitely but we have to plan it properly so can you tell me which one you want to start now?
12/05/23, 16:15 - Unknown: It can be the corporate alliance or the african school reform project
12/05/23, 16:23 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: I would love to work on the corporate alliance project first please.
12/05/23, 16:28 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: Is it possible to work on both projects at the same time though?
12/05/23, 16:42 - Unknown: Alright! let us go through it once again
12/05/23, 16:42 - Unknown: Today we're going to talk about how to find student-centric SMEs in Africa using Google and LinkedIn. Are you familiar with these tools?
12/05/23, 16:51 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: Yes I am....
May I ask what SMEs are?
12/05/23, 17:30 - Unknown: SMEs stands for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. These are businesses that typically have fewer employees, less revenue, and a smaller market share than larger corporations. The exact definition of an SME can vary depending on the country or region, but generally, it refers to businesses that have fewer than 250 employees and annual revenue of less than a certain amount.
12/05/23, 17:39 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: Okay I'm following
12/05/23, 17:44 - Unknown: we'll go through it step by step. Let's start with Google. When you're searching for student-centric SMEs in Africa, what keywords do you think you should use?
12/05/23, 17:49 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: Small scale online businesses in Africa
12/05/23, 17:53 - Unknown: That's a good start. You could also try "student-centered SMEs in Africa" or "African startups focused on education". Once you have a list of relevant startups, the next step is to find the company officials on LinkedIn. Have you used LinkedIn before?
12/05/23, 17:55 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: At one time Mr. Anadi told me to install it .....so I was supposed to fill in my profile and I asked him what I should write ....then he told me to forget about it as we were focusing on the first project ...so I eventually deleted it
12/05/23, 17:56 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: So I don't really know how it works
12/05/23, 18:13 - Unknown: We will learn how to use it properly now, so can you install the app once again?
12/05/23, 18:20 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: Sure ...
12/05/23, 18:40 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: I have successfully installed the application
18/05/23, 15:45 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: I am a proud Edoofian
18/05/23, 15:45 - Unknown: `- That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!`

`- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.``- How do you intend to broaden this student community? 

In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.
18/05/23, 15:48 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: The last time we had a session you had instructed me to install the LinkedIn app
18/05/23, 16:24 - Unknown: Hi Rutendo! Yes I asked you to install and make a profile there so can you tell me if you have made the profile now?
18/05/23, 16:25 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: I'm not sure what I should include on my profile....care to assistü§≤üèº?
18/05/23, 16:35 - Unknown: Yes please share what you have made till now!!!
30/05/23, 16:17 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: I am a proud Edoofian
30/05/23, 16:17 - Unknown: Who is Africa's longest serving leader?
a. Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya
b. Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea
c. Nelson Mandela of South Africa
d. Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe
30/05/23, 16:26 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: The answer would be B
10/06/23, 15:30 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: I am proud Edoofian

This weekend we go back to the basics of EWYL with our 3 important keys! 
 Link: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtPOMh0pgPs/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA== 

Share in the comments if you have known this before and why is it important!!
10/06/23, 15:48 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: I'm having a little bit of network challenges.... the video is failing to load on time.
10/06/23, 15:49 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: I'll keep trying
10/06/23, 16:06 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week‚Äôs Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better‚Äîtogether. It‚Äôs why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger‚Äîas successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!
10/06/23, 16:08 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: I am a proud Edoofian and I have to say that without Edoofa education abroad isn't affordable especially to us Africans hence Edoofa plays a major role in my higher and tertiary education.

12/06/23, 17:01 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: Yes I have ....I'm still trying to open it
12/06/23, 17:02 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: Mr Maurice it's the same reelüëÄü§≤üèº
12/06/23, 17:14 - Unknown: Yes dear, please ignore if you have done it, have you done the Saturday Activity?
13/06/23, 15:42 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703: Networking is very important in our day to day lives. It helps in many fields such as marketing, advertising and publicity. The same goes for the student community at Edoofa. Major initiatives have been taken to contact various school heads to spread the word out here. I have personally made an effort to tell my friends about how lucky I am to be a part of the Edoofa community. A lot of Zimbabweans might think it's a scam  because opportunities like these are not open most of the times. The Edoofa team has put an effort by creating testimonial videos for everyone and uploading them on social media platforms like Instagram. But again, due to our rusty economy , a few can only afford to access the internet. Another better way would be reaching out to national television broadcasting companies and make a scheduled interview alongside with the minister of education so that people would really really believe that it's not a scam. Some have heard the word but they choose let the opportunity pass but the sad truth is most of the times we let life changing opportunities pass because of what we hear.
