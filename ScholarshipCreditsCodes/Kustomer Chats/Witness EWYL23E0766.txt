12/12/23, 16:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me share with you how our star performer for last week-Loice did complete her targets.​
​She shared three schools and you know she got to know about them through Google.​
​She simply searched on Google like 'School nearby'/'School in Harare'/'School in Manicaland' and so on. She was able to yield results. ​
​So even without physically visiting them, she got to know about them through Google, got their contact details, and after that got in touch with them Via WhatsApp.

13/12/23, 16:29 - Saloni Rastogi: *Happy Wednesday*🌻

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
Team EWYL

18/12/23, 18:34 - Saloni Rastogi: att
18/12/23, 19:53 - Witness EWYL23E0766: Thanks alot
19/12/23, 15:50 - Saloni Rastogi: Good afternoon Witness,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
19/12/23, 16:14 - Witness EWYL23E0766: Yes we may
19/12/23, 16:14 - Witness EWYL23E0766: I'm fine and you
19/12/23, 16:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Since you did not follow the daily ritual on Saturday you have not received the Saturday activity.
19/12/23, 16:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to is the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
19/12/23, 16:17 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
19/12/23, 16:23 - Witness EWYL23E0766: Okay fine
19/12/23, 16:25 - Saloni Rastogi: So can you share the updates on the projects that we discussed so far?
19/12/23, 16:29 - Witness EWYL23E0766: Have sent to two of my friends
19/12/23, 16:29 - Witness EWYL23E0766: With the headteachers of schools they're having doubts about the program
19/12/23, 16:29 - Witness EWYL23E0766: Since you don't have a physical address here in Malawi
19/12/23, 16:29 - Witness EWYL23E0766: Convincing them has been impossible
19/12/23, 16:29 - Witness EWYL23E0766: Will try other schools this week
19/12/23, 16:39 - Saloni Rastogi: There are two ways to work on the African School Reform project:
19/12/23, 16:39 - Saloni Rastogi: A. *Connecting with school virtually*-
▪️ In this you would have to find the contacts of the schools through your peers, friends, neighbors, cousins, school teachers, and school heads.
▪️Then introduce yourself to them professionally and state the purpose of connecting with them along with their available time.
▪️ Then share information about Edoofa that I will be providing you in order to help them understand the Program deeply and with more clarity.
▪️ Then share the school form with them, and if they are interested in connecting with us, then our aim should be to get the form filled.
19/12/23, 16:41 - Saloni Rastogi: B. *Visiting schools physically*

▪️ Now by this, as it clearly says, you have to visit schools nearby and inform them about Edoofa.
▪️ Visiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
▪️ With this, you will surely gain a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, overcome the fear of presenting yourself and your family Edoofa, spontaneously in front of anyone at any point.
19/12/23, 16:41 - Saloni Rastogi: Also, let me share some media with you on the EWYL Group that can definitely help you to convince them
