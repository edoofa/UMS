How are you?

I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
23/05/23, 19:19 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
23/05/23, 19:20 - Saloni Rastogi: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *02:00-03:30 PM.*

03/07/23, 14:04 - Tanatswanashe EWYL23E0099: I am good
03/07/23, 14:05 - Saloni Rastogi: I am writing to inform you about an unfortunate development regarding your participation in the challenge and grant document discussion.

I have noticed that you did not attend the session held on Thursday Or Friday as well as the final call for grant document discussion, despite prior notification and reminders. Your active participation in these sessions was crucial for finalizing the grant documentation and ensuring the smooth progress of the challenge.

Regrettably, due to your absence from these sessions, we have no choice but to cancel your participation in the challenge. Non-attendance has resulted in a significant setback for the team, as we require the input and collaboration of all participants to successfully execute the challenge.

We have more than 100 students participating and we want it to be fair to the Active students.
03/07/23, 14:05 - Saloni Rastogi: As a mentor, I don't want you to lose on opportunities so I hope you will be attentive in the coming sessions so that we can keep you in the coming up challenge.
03/07/23, 14:08 - Tanatswanashe EWYL23E0099: But you had said we are starting on Monday ma’am which session did l miss?

We hope you are doing well, its time for us to put on our learners hat. Today’s Wednesday lesson will be on the invaluable trait of consistency.
