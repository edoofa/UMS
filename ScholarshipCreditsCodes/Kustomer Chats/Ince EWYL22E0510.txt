13/10/22, 07:50 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

The inner sense of captaincy is a vital component of leadership that gives individuals the confidence and determination to make a positive impact. It involves having a deep understanding of oneself, embracing weaknesses, and having a positive growth-oriented mindset. Developing an inner sense of captaincy can help individuals navigate challenges, inspire and motivate others, and tap into their full potential as leaders. In today’s Wednesday wisdom, we will explore the importance of this aspect of leadership. 

We will discuss your key learnings in our today’s session!
