13/10/22, 00:02 - Tanaka EWYL22E0460: 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am  Tanaka Mukahanana and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is 22E0460
13/10/22, 00:03 - Tanaka EWYL22E0460: I am a proud EDOOFIAN'
13/10/22, 00:04 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
13/10/22, 00:06 - Tanaka EWYL22E0460: Not to be rude but ... Why do I have to say it daily though
13/10/22, 00:19 - Unknown: Greetings Tanaka!
How are you?
13/10/22, 00:21 - Tanaka EWYL22E0460: I'm doing great!
13/10/22, 00:21 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
13/10/22, 00:22 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
13/10/22, 00:58 - Tanaka EWYL22E0460: Alright... Understood
14/10/22, 18:17 - Unknown: Greetings Tanaka!
How are you?
14/10/22, 18:17 - Tanaka EWYL22E0460: I'm great how are you
14/10/22, 18:18 - Unknown: I see you have typed 2 and 3, which reflects unclarity as to who an edoofian is and what it denotes.
14/10/22, 18:18 - Tanaka EWYL22E0460: 1

14/10/22, 18:19 - Unknown: I am doing lovely, thanks for asking.
14/10/22, 18:19 - Tanaka EWYL22E0460: Okay thank you will definitely do so
14/10/22, 18:20 - Unknown: That would be amazing, I would be happy to see you consistently following the daily ritual and in case you have any doubt about the same, you can surely reach out to me.
14/10/22, 18:21 - Unknown: We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In the session on the EWYL Line, we will:
1) discuss on the Wednesday lesson
2) video to be shared as a part of the weekend activity
14/10/22, 18:22 - Unknown: Along with this, I have an amazing opportunity for you, but I will share with you only when you will share with me what you have learned from the Wednesday lesson and the video that was to be sent for the weekend activity.
I have this opportunity reserved just for you, exclusively for my bright students.
14/10/22, 18:23 - Tanaka EWYL22E0460: No video was sent to me last week ... I don't remember receiving a video
14/10/22, 18:27 - Unknown: Tanaka, sorry for the error. I have another student named Tanaka and the lesson was sent to her twice, I will send you again.
Please don't worry and I would want that you go through the lesson and let me know what you have understood from it.
14/10/22, 18:28 - Unknown: Will that be okay?
I am very interested to see how well you understand them.
This would be your first lesson right!!
14/10/22, 18:29 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real-life example. That is how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because in the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.
14/10/22, 18:39 - Tanaka EWYL22E0460: Sure it's okay 
Don't worry bout it
