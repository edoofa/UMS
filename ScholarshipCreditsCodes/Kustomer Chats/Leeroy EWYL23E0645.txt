22/10/23, 19:10 - Leeroy EWYL23E0645: 1. They are three projects which are 
Corporate alliances, Community building, and African Schools Education reform mission

2. Project 1
I as an edoofian reach out to companies which deal in student based products and services. I then identify the decision makers in these organisations and reach out to them through linkedln. I can also reach this people through our own connections if it is possible. As soon as the professional accepts our request on linkedln, I then send a specific message and then wait for the response. Once the professional accepts a call with the seniors in team edoofa i arrange a call that suits both the stakeholders. After the call I make a report on a Google sheet and then share it with awelsedoofa.com

3. Project 2

I reach out to youths I can in my local and offer them an opportunity to be part of edoofa's educational ecosystem. I reach out to African youths. Firstly I create a list of youths who I want to reach too. The team esoofa will help me create a strategy to reach out to my list of youths

4. Project 3

We as edoofians reach out to schools in our local region and speak to the decision makers to collaborate with edoofa. I make a list of higher secondary schools with my school on top. The team edoofa will identify the decision makers in these schools and reach out to them and connect to the decision makers. 

Lastly in every project successfully completed I get scholarship credits.
