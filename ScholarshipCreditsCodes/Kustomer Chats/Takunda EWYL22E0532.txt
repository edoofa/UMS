02/01/23, 17:29 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up.

04/01/23, 23:02 - Unknown: *Wednesday Lesson | 4 Jan*

Persuasion is the art of convincing others to agree with the view you have or go through with your actions. Many people know about it, but not everyone is able to use it to its full capacity. In regular businesses, persuasion is very important as it can boost your sales and gain trust. However, people still haven’t fully realized the value persuasion has in a professional career yet. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will give you a chance to learn about this skill and help you to ingrain the same in you. 

_I would like to write in brief about how you will be using these skills for the EWYL projects_ 
And, As discussed earlier, I would be requiring you to share your response 5 mins prior to our next session.

Happy learning.

Sorry the power has been out for more than 24 hours now that is since yesterday morning at 1:30am Zimbabwe time.
10/01/23, 22:47 - Takunda EWYL22E0532: It's not yet back on but I managed to charge my phone.

Let us start then
10/01/23, 23:06 - Unknown: Edoofian, Due to a technical error, I was not able to share the Saturday Activity with you. Therefore, I am sharing it below:
I hope that you are aware that the deadline to share the response is 5 mins prior to our session timings but since the activity got delayed therefore, You can share it with me by Tomorrow.
10/01/23, 23:06 - Unknown: \"Sell me this pen.\" That might just be the best sales one-liner in history.

Over the last 10 years, I've seen many sales leaders use this question as part of their interview process to whittle out the \"can-dos\" from the \"can-nots.\" 

It's a favorite amongst sales professionals, from used car salespeople to Wall Street wolves. And for good reason — it's an exciting, accessible way to test a salesperson's fundamentals. How someone responds to those four words can tell you a lot about how — and how well — a candidate is going to perform in his\/her job. 

Let's try to respond to this prominent question as part of your Saturday submission. Your response must be shared in at least 150 words. 

I'm anticipating a highly original and creative response from your end.
10/01/23, 23:19 - Takunda EWYL22E0532: The first thing that comes in my when I hear that is how much value does the buyer see in my pen. So I first assess the value of my pen. After that I will then offer the buyer a one week trial and I will come back to check if the buyer likes it or not. I will also be calculating the risk if the person loses the pen which the buyer will have to pay for if he\/she does. If the pen meets the buyer's expectations I will sell it to him as per the value of the pen and if it does not meet the buyer's expectations, I will have more pens to offer.
10/01/23, 23:24 - Unknown: Great work!
An effective sales strategy is a crucial part of business growth. Having a clearly defined strategy enables you to plan for the future, assess problems and manage different approaches across the organisation.
11/01/23, 18:48 - Unknown: Greetings, Takunda
How are you?

Edoofian, For The past 7 days, We have missed both our sessions.
You have not submitted the Wednesday Lesson from last week.
Also, You have not performed the Proud Edoofian Ritual regularly.

These are the 3 core principles on which our EWYL Program stands.
When a student misses out on all three, This means that either the student is facing some severe challenges or the student has lost interest in the goals that he\/she wanted to establish when we started the EWYL Program.

May I know what happened to you?

12/01/23, 06:30 - Unknown: Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. Some models of problem solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals towards achieving this goal. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

For example you can it very important to use the multidisciplinary approach when solving problems. That is the when you have a problem to solve you should also look into other basic knowledge in solving such a problem from different sources. Therefore you can combine all those sources to come to a conclusion on how to solve your problem.

12/01/23, 18:26 - Takunda EWYL22E0532: This Email is quite motivational. I mean she worked really hard and earned so much credits.

From this I feel very motivated.
