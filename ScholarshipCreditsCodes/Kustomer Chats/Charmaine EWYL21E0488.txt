20/08/22, 04:10 - Charmaine EWYL21E0488: personal brand it’s a way for people to know what you’re all about,  your goals andyour mission in the professional world.  branding yourself is an important consideration within a professionalcontex hasmade it essential for any professional. Your personal brand is critical because it is a representation of you that others are presentedwith when they look for you online, as well as the image that you choose to project in face-to-face interactions. Whether we are aware of it or not, all of our activities online – on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitteror other social media platforms – form an online personal profile that is searchable. Andtoday, employers and recruiters are using the internet to conduct employment backgroundsearches, and to gauge an idea of the character and interests of their potential employees.Interestingly, 57% of employers are less likely to interview a candidate they can’t find online.So actively creating a personal brand for yourself allows you to have a say in how you marketyourself and gives you control in crafting an accurate picture of your identity, rather than ithappening purely by default. While social networking sites are predominately about engaging in a social environment, it’swise to view them as platforms on which you can easily start building a personal brand.  Your personal brand needs to be constructed so that it is easily articulated in an onlineenvironment, as well as clearly communicated verbally and through behaviours and actions.

Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!

I hope you all are doing well.

We have got a piece of very exciting news for you!
I, your proud mentor, and EWYL Coaches have been planning on providing you with a few subject-specific skills, apart from the vocational & industry-relevant skills which are being provided right now, that would help to strengthen your foundation and use it in a better way to excel in the future.

However, to create a curriculum that fits the knowledge of every individual, we need your help in sharing the information regarding your A-Level subjects. 
Hence, I request you to please share your A-Level Subjects with me below so that, we can gather the data and start working on building new and better learning content for your sessions to ensure overall growth.
28/10/22, 18:38 - Charmaine EWYL21E0488: I'm proudly Edoofian
28/10/22, 18:39 - Charmaine EWYL21E0488: Pure mathematics economics and business studies
28/10/22, 18:56 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello, My Dear Proud Edoofian.

We all know that \"History is Written by Winners\", but not everybody knows the discipline, dedication, sacrifices, time, and efforts put behind it.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the kind of mindset a winner possesses, and about the person who carved his way from the bottom to the top, and even beyond. The story of a basketball player turning into a lethal black mamba on the court, the habits he formed, and the mindset he forged, to turn into a winner, is inspirational and the most practical way to better oneself every single day. You will learn a lot of different things from this lesson, about the attitude, instinct, and character of a true all-round winner.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

03/11/22, 19:56 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We all have come across the quote, \"Quitters Never Win, and Winners Never Quit\", and we also must have experienced this in our lives, directly or indirectly.

If last week's lesson, taught you the mindset of a winner, this week's lesson is going to teach you the true nature of a winner. Someone, who never gives up, or quits on the dream they see and really want to fulfill, no matter what. Moving through scorching heat, drenching rains, and heavy snow, they reach their destination and complete their journey. In this lesson, you will also learn, what happens when an entire community inherits this trait and keeps working on it. How recognition is earned and respect is gained through time, patience, and endless efforts.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it.

Happy Learning.

10/11/22, 17:50 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian,

“When I discover who I am, I'll be free.” ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.

10/11/22, 23:47 - Charmaine EWYL21E0488: Yes
11/11/22, 00:07 - Aditi Kapoor: Please summarise therm for me

11/11/22, 02:13 - Charmaine EWYL21E0488: The third one is to link with school talking to the principals of the schools introducing about edoofa and sharing information about the scholarship. Arrange meetings for edoofa with the principal
11/11/22, 02:59 - Charmaine EWYL21E0488: *Flexible* 
 I am someone who can quickly adapt to changes. 

 *Self-motivated* 
I am someone who is disciplined without the presence of a supervisor. I do not need supervision or reminders to complete my responsibilities.


 *Success-oriented* 
I am focused on the overall objective. I complete my duties with the desired goal in mind and I gives a purpose toward my  daily responsibilities.




 *Trustworthy* 
 I am someone who is honest and  accountable. 

 *Problem-solver* 
 I am someone who is good at evaluating a situation and providing solutions.
11/11/22, 04:10 - Charmaine EWYL21E0488: To  be  self-aware  you  should  be  able  to  identify  yourself  with emotions,  see  yourself  honestly,  recognize  your  strengths  and weaknesses,  and  have  the  plan  to  work  towards  them




Poor planning and unwillingness to adapt are traits that keep us from doing sessions and projects sometimes and to achieve we need to improve on this and  be good planner and time management.
