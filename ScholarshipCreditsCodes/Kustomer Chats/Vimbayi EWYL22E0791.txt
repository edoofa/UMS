18/05/23, 17:16 - Ananya: Kindly share your Wednesday lesson understanding with me here!
18/05/23, 17:17 - Vimbayi EWYL22E0791: Okay ma'am
18/05/23, 17:31 - Vimbayi EWYL22E0791: It is talking about a servant leader whereby his goal is to serve the people rather than being served himself. Mr Angad Singh and Mr Avreen Singh the founders of the Edoofa Program are passionate about changing people's lives and despite the adversities they are strong leaders, despite of many challenges faced like the Covid 19 as good leaders , people's salaries are paid on time and they make sure their workers are taken care of.There are characteristics quoted by Larry C Spears which includes ; listening, a good leader must be a good listener; emphaty , is being able to understand people's thoughts and perspectives ; healing , which talks about making sure people have got the support and knowledge needed; self awareness, one should be able to control their emotions to be a good servant leader; persuasion, a good servant leader must be able to encourage people to take action ; conceptualization, to be a good leader one has to dream big and work hard ; foresight, meaning a good leader must foresee the future and prepare ; stewardship, a good leader must take action on roles played in an organisation; commitment to the growth of people, one must be committed to personal and professional development of everyone and last buh not least there is building community, it is the sense of building a community with my organisation to be a good leader.

I learnt a lot from Mr Angad Singh and Mr Avreen Singh in their journey and leadership style.
18/05/23, 19:16 - Ananya: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the Wednesday lesson. It is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.

29/05/23, 15:32 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.

Moreover, I derived great pleasure from viewing the captivating video and photos shared by a few of my students. The entire team is filled with joy and excitement.
