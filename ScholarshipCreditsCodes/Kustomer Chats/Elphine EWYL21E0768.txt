1.Critical thinking and problem solving
One need to develop a skill at seeing problems from different angles and formulating solutions.The ability to think and act quickly is an indispensable tool for the future

2.Agility and adaptability
If we look back we can see a lot of changes in the workplace and the world .One needs to be comfortable with the idea of change and be willing to adapt to the changes around him or her

3.initiative and entrepreneurship
A student need to be able to take initiative and contribute to the world

4.Effective oral and written communication
With practice,you should be able to improve your gesture,speed, volume and eye contact when addressing people

5.Accessing and analyzing information
Internet provides an incredible research tool that can be your friend or enemy.Accessing information is easy but accessing good information tends to be more complicated

6.Curiosity and imagination lead to creativity
12/07/22, 22:38 - Unknown: Elphine, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.
This way you will always be recognized by the Academics Board for new projects.
12/07/22, 22:39 - Unknown: Elphine, I am sure that you must have seen my messages on the EWYL Group?
12/07/22, 23:10 - Elphine EWYL21E0768: Yes sir
12/07/22, 23:36 - Unknown: Please tell me what challenges are you facing, Elphine?
Because this is the second time, I am giving you this reminder.
13/07/22, 17:10 - Elphine EWYL21E0768: Good morning sir I am a Proud Edoofian
13/07/22, 17:12 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

15/07/22, 18:28 - Elphine EWYL21E0768: _Lessons behind Patrice Motsepe's story_ 


Your past cannot define your future ,Patrice was born in Soweto from a poor background but despite that he managed to study hard and become a successful lawyer.Nomatter where you come from in terms of economic stability there is no limit to the heights you can archive
Education plays a very important role in our society but to be able to lead,one needs to personally learn and imbibe good leadership skills.
Though things may be doing well in your life,you need to remember that there are people around you who are not as lucky as you are so you need to give out a helping hand
You have to ensure that you develop good character that will highly define you in the society,this will guide you to more elevated heights.
Quiting is never an option if you really want success,view an problem as a challenge and make it an opportunity to hit even greater heights and always remember whatever doesn't kill you will only make you stronger.
When you compete with yourself for a good course you make wise decisions that promote good character
Life is all about having visions,it is the only way to achieve the best and live a successful life.Visions give you purpose and also help you to keep focused.

◼️Keep an eye on the Saturday Activity that will be shared in your batch group
◼️Also, If you haven't submitted the Wednesday Lesson yet, Please make sure that you submit it as soon as possible.

As August Intake is right at our doorsteps, So due to this many of our Edoofians will be arriving here in India to kick start their dream journey.?

I feel that it is my duty to make sure that the university has prepared well for their onboarding process.

This is why I would be visiting the universities Today in order to do a personal check up.
Since, This process would take up lots of time that is why we won't be able to connect Today.
However, I am sure that in my absence, You will make sure that you follow the below given things:

1. Make sure to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual at 9 AM Tomorrow.
2. Do submit the Wednesday Lesson before the deadline.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time.
