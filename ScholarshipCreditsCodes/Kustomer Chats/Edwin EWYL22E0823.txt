07/02/23, 21:54 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian.

09/02/23, 23:33 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello, let me share the Wednesday lesson for this week.

Let us start our day with a quote: “Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.”

The inner sense of captaincy is a vital component of leadership that gives individuals the confidence and determination to make a positive impact. It involves having a deep understanding of oneself, embracing weaknesses, and having a positive growth-oriented mindset. Developing an inner sense of captaincy can help individuals navigate challenges, inspire and motivate others, and tap into their full potential as leaders. In today’s Wednesday wisdom, we will explore the importance of this aspect of leadership. 

We will discuss your key learnings in our today’s session!
09/02/23, 23:49 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: Very informative
10/02/23, 16:50 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings my proud edoofian,
I hope you are doing well!

Let us start our day with a quote: What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.” — Henry David Thoreau
10/02/23, 17:03 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: Really inspiring ?
10/02/23, 17:06 - Jasmine Kaur: Have you gone through the Wednesday lesson?
10/02/23, 17:10 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: Yes.......I did my research on big companies like apple, google and amazon which use the app
10/02/23, 19:23 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, what did you learn about captaincy and leadership?
10/02/23, 21:06 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: That a leader shouldn't command or force things on to the people his leading bi instead should work with his people and guide them
10/02/23, 23:23 - Jasmine Kaur: First of all, I would like to congratulate you on being selected for the Social Media Project. I have been observing your active participation and interest in the EWYL program so I have chosen you to take part in a special project where you will learn how social media can benefit a company or an organization from the amount of customer engagement on their platforms, as well as positive reviews. 

From this project, you will learn how to be familiar with social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube, understand how Edoofa’s social media is built, network and build a connection with other students around the world, and much more!

The scholarship credits that you can earn from this project are a total of $20, which you will get when you complete each and every task every day successfully. In the worst-case scenario, if you are not able to complete the task given to you before the deadline due to a genuine reason, you will only be given the credits for the tasks you have accomplished, so make sure not to miss out on any task to attain the maximum credits from this project.

Duration of project: 1 month

Please let me know if you are available for a month or not?
Do you have a stable internet connection?
Also, do you have social media handles [Instagram + Facebook] ?
11/02/23, 00:06 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: I am free for a month.
I do have stable Internet connection.
And I have an Instagram account but not a facebook account

11/02/23, 20:37 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my proud edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Its time for your Saturday Activity, This activity will allows you to reflect on your leadership abilities, share your experiences with your mentor, and receive feedback from them, which can help you grow as a leader.

1. You are required to think about a situation where you had to take the lead, such as organizing a school event, starting a new club, or resolving a conflict among friends.
2. Write a short reflection on the experience, focusing on the following points:
* What was the situation and what were the challenges you faced?
* How did you demonstrate the inner sense of captaincy in this situation?
* What were the results of your actions and how did you feel about your leadership?

You are required to share your responses by Monday over the EYWL Line.

How was your weekend?
Let us gear up to work on your Saturday task!
13/02/23, 20:27 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: It was all right thanks
13/02/23, 20:35 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: It was during the inter District Junior Engineers Technicians and scientists fair. We, as a school, had little to no participants and the leaders were uninterested in the fair. So me and 2 friends of mine took it upon ourselves to collect and convince people to join the club. We gathered the individuals according to their skills and interests from all grades in the school. And by the end of it we had over 57 participants, which was more than enough to fit all categories of the competition. That activity gave me a clearer sense of passion of what I want to do with my life and what I am capable to do if I just put my mind in the position to do it.
13/02/23, 22:13 - Jasmine Kaur: Great, I appreciate your efforts

03/03/23, 21:14 - Jasmine Kaur: Good afternoon, Edwin! Remember that success is not final, failure is not fatal, it's the courage to continue that count.
03/03/23, 21:15 - Jasmine Kaur: Did you understand what this quote is trying to convey?
03/03/23, 21:15 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: I will always remember that
03/03/23, 21:16 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes Edwin
03/03/23, 21:17 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: Yes I did........its that no matter how many times you fail, even after success, its important to keep goings.
03/03/23, 21:18 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes you are so on point.
03/03/23, 21:18 - Jasmine Kaur: You know this is a famous quote by Winston Churchill, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
03/03/23, 21:20 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: I didn't know that but I guess I do now.
03/03/23, 21:21 - Jasmine Kaur: Well I am glad you have learned one new thing today.
03/03/23, 21:22 - Jasmine Kaur: So Edwin in today's session, I want you to tell a few things. This will be more like an introduction to what we will do this month.
03/03/23, 21:22 - Jasmine Kaur: Are you ready for it
03/03/23, 21:23 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: I am
03/03/23, 21:25 - Jasmine Kaur: So, as your mentor, it is my utmost priority to ensure your academic and personal growth. Therefore, I have formulated an exclusive plan for you to achieve a milestone of earning at least $100 in the month of March.
03/03/23, 21:27 - Jasmine Kaur: To achieve this goal, we will be working on both Project 2, the Community Building project, and Project 3, the African School Reform mission project, throughout this month. Our target for this month will be to submit 20 Community Building forms and 10 School forms.
03/03/23, 21:29 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: All right I understand
03/03/23, 21:32 - Jasmine Kaur: Well that's great Edwin. From now onwards, each form submitted should have a sequence number written on the top to enable us to monitor and track your progress effectively.
03/03/23, 21:37 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: No problem
But I kind of had some trouble the first time I tried this project.
03/03/23, 21:37 - Jasmine Kaur: Are you following Edwin?
03/03/23, 21:38 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: I am.
03/03/23, 21:38 - Jasmine Kaur: Which one? Could you please elaborate
03/03/23, 21:42 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: On the Africa School Reform mission project heads of the schools continuously mentioned that they were to busy to see me.
03/03/23, 21:43 - Jasmine Kaur: Well that's a tough one. Tell me one thing.
03/03/23, 21:43 - Jasmine Kaur: How were you contacting the headmasters?
03/03/23, 21:48 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: I would go to the school and would be directed to the school secretary. There I would ask for a time for which I could see the head concerning the Edoofa program. Most of the time they say that they would get back to me on the appropriate time to see the head and they would take down my information. They wouldn't respond and when I go back to the school they would tell me that they didn't find time for me.
03/03/23, 21:51 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: And for the community building project, most if not all of the people I know already have their own program by now so the only people that would be willing to join the Edoofa program are in their final year (in boarding school )
03/03/23, 21:59 - Jasmine Kaur: Well that's some serious issues. Let's do one thing. We will try working on these projects for this month. I will be helping you on your every step, From approaching the correct schools to scripts that you will be using and etc.
03/03/23, 22:01 - Jasmine Kaur: If it worked then well and good but if not then we will switch. It's always good to try. On our end, we can just give our 100%.Right?
03/03/23, 22:02 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: Right

03/03/23, 22:07 - Jasmine Kaur: Great
03/03/23, 22:11 - Jasmine Kaur: In addition,* we will be meeting twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays, from 11:30 am-1:30 pm for project discussions*. On Wednesdays, you will receive your lesson, and on Saturdays, you will be given an activity. It is imperative that you actively participate in both lessons and activities to enhance your performance in the projects and your overall personal growth.

03/03/23, 22:16 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: No problem
03/03/23, 22:17 - Jasmine Kaur: It is your responsibility to message me five minutes before our session to mark your attendance.* Additionally, you are required to come to the EWYL Line every day, irrespective of your session schedule, and write \"I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN.\" This daily affirmation will help manifest your goals in the universe and propel you towards success
03/03/23, 22:22 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: No problem......I will do that.
03/03/23, 22:24 - Jasmine Kaur: If you have any queries, feel free to address them, and I will provide you with the necessary clarification
03/03/23, 22:27 - Edwin EWYL22E0823: I will thanks
03/03/23, 22:30 - Jasmine Kaur: Now it was a good introductory session for March. Now, it's time to wrap up, but before that I want you to make a list of 10 schools that are near your place. Take today's time and try to submit the list by the end of today. 
I will tell you which schools are already connected to us so that your hard work doesn't go in vain. My motive will be that you approach only those schools that are not connected with us. 
Start working on THE LIST 
Also, try to be on time for the sessions, otherwise, I won't be able to give you my time. I hope you understand. 
Have a great day ahead. ☘️

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”
