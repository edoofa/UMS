20/07/22, 01:52 - Unknown: Let me first help you understand what SWOT Analysis is, Karen.

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment.This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organisations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
20/07/22, 18:35 - Karen EWYL22E0155: Ok  thank you
20/07/22, 21:53 - Unknown: Karen, As seen above, SWOT is an acronym of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. However, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym:

1 Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
2 Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
3 Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
4 Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by
21/07/22, 17:32 - Unknown: Hello Karen how are you doing?
21/07/22, 22:47 - Karen EWYL22E0155: It has strengths since it has many companies that carter many employees,it also seen in everycountry helping it in profit making.It has its weaknesses since many  people are going there and it makes the company   to be flooded.

Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!
