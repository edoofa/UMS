14/07/22, 18:07 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian!
14/07/22, 18:14 - Nyasha EWYL22E0092: I am so grateful to be part and parcel to this Wednesday Wisdom lessons.

Yesterday's Wisdom was based on the story of Patrice Motsepe.
His life is very inspirational and l enjoyed every part of it.

Just to mention few pointers l liked most, Patrice Motsepe was always willing to learn and acquire knowledge from people with better wisdom and better understanding than his, ( this was mentioned when understood and showed interest in mining business through his father's customers.)
Patrice Motsepe was multi-skilled. Despite having a great job, holding two Bachelor's degrees in Arts and Law, he did not loose interest in mining business. He kept his hopes and likes alive. He became a core founder of Future Mining Co and a subsidiary of AngloGold. In 1997, he founded the African Rainbow Mining and was the first black person to own a mining operation.

Patrice Motsepe's life has motivated and inspired me to break the ice and cut a dash. The future is not determinated by your family background but where you want to be. It is not about who have accomplished what you want to be first but believing you are the one.  Patrice Motsepe took advantage of every opportunity given and invested in future, live his dream, work hard, aim high, strive hard, acquire knowledge and skills... finally success then follow.

I am impressed Mentor and has been motivated to make History. I can, l am and l will. The sky is the limit.
I am a proud Edoofian
14/07/22, 18:15 - Nyasha EWYL22E0092: I am good
