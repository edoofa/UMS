02/06/23, 13:58 - Tecla EWYL22E0095: Greetings Ms Jasmine
02/06/23, 14:02 - Tecla EWYL22E0095: My name is Tecla Mushangidze . I am here to resume my EWYLdiscussion . My EWYL Group is Tecla EWYL22E0095.
05/06/23, 12:57 - Tecla EWYL22E0095: I.m a proud Edoofian
05/06/23, 12:57 - Jasmine Kaur:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, Let me share a small story with you!
 Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came. 
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.
The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell: 

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. 
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above  
05/06/23, 12:59 - Tecla EWYL22E0095: It's a very inspiring story , thank you for sharing it with me

17/06/23, 23:10 - Jasmine Kaur: ðŸ“¢ Hello, students! It's time for our exciting Saturday activity! ðŸŽ‰ This week, we dived into the captivating world of entrepreneurship, exploring the remarkable stories of four inspirational entrepreneurs. I'm confident that you have thoroughly researched and read about each of them in detail.

Now, I invite you to reflect on the entrepreneurs we discussed and share your favorite among them. In 200 words, I encourage you to highlight two similarities and two dissimilarities between yourself and your chosen entrepreneur.

As you analyze these similarities and differences, consider various aspects such as their journey, mindset, values, and achievements. Remember, this activity is an opportunity for self-reflection and to identify areas where you can draw inspiration or learn from these exceptional individuals.

By examining the similarities, you may discover shared traits, passions, or aspirations, creating a sense of connection and motivation. Exploring the differences can help you recognize unique qualities and perspectives, encouraging you to embrace your own individuality and strengths.

So, take your time, think deeply, and express your thoughts in a well-crafted 200-word response. Feel free to share your insights, and let the inspiration from these entrepreneurs propel you towards your own entrepreneurial dreams.

Wishing you a thought-provoking and fulfilling Saturday activity! Enjoy the process of discovering more about yourself and the entrepreneurs who have left a lasting impact on the world.

18/06/23, 00:44 - Tecla EWYL22E0095: Have a good day ahead
20/06/23, 14:07 - Tecla EWYL22E0095: Good morning Ms Jasmine
20/06/23, 14:07 - Tecla EWYL22E0095: I think there is a misunderstanding.  We did not talk about entrepreneurs in our sessions
20/06/23, 15:23 - Tecla EWYL22E0095: It's time for our session
20/06/23, 15:44 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Afternoon dearðŸŒŸ
I hope you had a restful and rejuvenating weekend and you are in great spirits. Are you ready to make this week a productive and successful one?
20/06/23, 15:44 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay Tecla, we will come to that
20/06/23, 15:47 - Tecla EWYL22E0095: Good afternoon Ms Jasmine
20/06/23, 15:47 - Tecla EWYL22E0095: How is your day going
20/06/23, 15:49 - Jasmine Kaur: I am having a blessed day so far. Thank you for asking
Now, let us begin our session. I trust that you have completed your Saturday Activity, and I am eager to review it. Please share your Saturday Activity with me, as we delve into a productive discussion.
20/06/23, 15:50 - Tecla EWYL22E0095: That is the activity i was talking about , we never discussed about entrepreneurs before
20/06/23, 15:57 - Jasmine Kaur: Tecla, dear it was the choice. You were supposed to look for entrepreneurs based in Africa.
20/06/23, 16:01 - Tecla EWYL22E0095: Oooh , I thought i was supposed to write about the entrepreneurs who we had discussed as said on the activity
20/06/23, 16:14 - Jasmine Kaur: Well, That is a clear case of confusion. Don't worry. Take today's time and submit the activity by the end of today.
20/06/23, 16:14 - Jasmine Kaur: Now, , I would like you to take this opportunity to share your progress on the project and set achievable targets for this week. It is important to establish realistic goals that you can confidently work towards and ultimately achieve.
20/06/23, 16:15 - Tecla EWYL22E0095: Okay
20/06/23, 16:28 - Jasmine Kaur: Please go ahead
20/06/23, 18:35 - Tecla EWYL22E0095: Okay
22/06/23, 15:27 - Tecla EWYL22E0095: My  inspirational entrepreneur is Strive Masiyiwa . He is a London- based Zimbabwean billionaire , founder and executive  chairman of Econet wireless and Cassava technologies . He  is the most successful entrepreneur in Africa . 

 I will  beginning with the similarities between me and
Strive Masiyiwa. He mentioned that  " it is not  enough to lock yourself in your office  and to say " I'm going to do well ," and that's it . You have to be part of finding solutions around you . I can further add on my own quote which says that ," we keep a clock in our homes to tell us what time it is , but unknowingly it's a reminder  that it's time to make a difference out there and you can't do it whilst portraying the same routine everyday,  so take a stand and grab every opportunity that comes your way ." 

The dissimilarities are that  he has already undertaken the opportunity and became successful and that I am still in the process to become successful , I have already taken a step towards my success by joining the Edoofa program . 

I have learnt from him that success is a ladder . You can't anticipate success without taking the first step and you can't wake up successful , you have to earn it by climbing up and not looking back !

28/06/23, 16:06 - Tecla EWYL22E0095: How are you doing today
28/06/23, 16:10 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello My Proud Edoofian,
I am very well. Thankyou for asking

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

28/06/23, 16:11 - Jasmine Kaur: Lesson
28/06/23, 17:02 - Tecla EWYL22E0095: This is a very inspirational story. I truly appreciate you sharing it with me . I have also discovered that most people to be specific usually considers themselves to be an average student and usually lives within that limitation of being average and they don't have that hope to thrive to greater heights . I have learnt that it only takes courage and motivation to change yourself to try and exceed the optimal level we claim we can only achieve , just like how Alex got his motivation . However it was very thoughtful of him to share his way of success to the rest of his school , as said that success by uniting  brings most joy than success by greed .
