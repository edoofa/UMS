28/12/23, 16:30 - Faith EWYL23E0740: The surprise 

The sun was so hot and every one hopefully looked in the sky for rains to cool the hot air .It was on the twenty fourth of December .My family and l were planning to prepare a for the Christmas festive which was to start on early that evening.


We worked tirelessly on the preparation for the festive little did we know there was something  heart warming planned for us . As a family we were planning to spend the holiday at a park nearby the town . As a teenage I didn't really wish to spend the whole festive with the family.l needed some time with my peers, but unfortunately I couldn't disobey my parents.


In the Afternoon that day we were done with the preparation for Christmas  . My dad came home early that evening .I was very excited because he rarely does that ,but to my surprise he was drenched with sweat . His face was very dull.I could not understand the look on his face but it definitely reflected that something was wrong .My mother took him inside and they had a little talk in their bedroom. I tried to eves drop but I could not hear anything.

When they opened the door, my mom 's face showed depression .With immediate effect she started packing our clothes.  I asked her what was going on but she kept silent .The only words she told me was " go and bath we are leaving " .



l was really shocked by this .The only thing I could do was to obey her . After we finished everything we went to the airport to catch a flight .I didn't know where we were going but we were definitely going abroad . We got into the plane and we departed . I Then slowly drifted into a sleep.


"Faith woke up " I heard my mom shouting . Then I opened my eyes we were in South Africa I could not believe my eyes . I had never been there before. We went to my favorite uncle 's house .I was very surprised to see that he lived in a beautiful,big house like that .I settled my self on the sofa ."Oh really so you lied that he was admitted in the hospital yesterday ,so that we could spend Christmas here" I had my mom laughing with my aunt . My mom came and told me we were going to spend Christmas and new year at my uncle's place.

I was really happy because I was to spend the holiday with my niece Tanya and my nephew Tara .These were my age mates .

We prepared for the festives together .lt was a wonderful holiday .We visited many places of interest together .I was very happy. I received a lot of gifts from friends I had made that day. We also spent a great new year there.

04/01/24, 15:46 - Ananya: As we kick off our session, here's a quote to fuel our motivation: 'The only way to do great work is to love what you do.' - Steve Jobs.
Let's approach our tasks with passion and commitment, aiming for excellence in everything we undertake today! üöÄ

04/01/24, 15:52 - Ananya: So,to begin our session, may I ask if you had a chance to read your Wednesday lesson?
04/01/24, 15:53 - Faith EWYL23E0740: Yes I did
04/01/24, 15:55 - Ananya: Great! Kindly share your understaning with me then!
04/01/24, 16:04 - Faith EWYL23E0740: I have understood that participating actively in students events, seminar and workshops is a valuable investment in personal and professional growth.these experience gives opportunities for enhancing skills.
04/01/24, 16:11 - Ananya: Absolutely, I wholeheartedly agree. Active participation in student activities not only provides valuable opportunities for networking but also plays a crucial role in skill-building.
04/01/24, 16:22 - Faith EWYL23E0740: I have also learnt that peer networking fosters a sense of community. Moreso, engaging in seminars and workshops provide opportunity to improve public speaking skills .Moreover,taking in an active role in planning and organizing student events develops leadership and organisation skills
04/01/24, 16:30 - Ananya: Great, Faith! So, for today, we will be discussing our third project! I will share a few crucial resources and tricks with you!
04/01/24, 16:31 - Ananya: There are two ways to work on the African School Reform project:


A. *Connecting with school virtually*-
‚ñ™Ô∏è In this you would have to find the contacts of the schools through your peers, friends, neighbors, cousins, school teachers, and school heads.
‚ñ™Ô∏èThen introduce yourself to them professionally and state the purpose of connecting with them along with their available time.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share information about Edoofa that I will be providing you in order to help them understand the Program deeply and with more clarity.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Then share the school form with them, and if they are interested in connecting with us, then our aim should be to get the form filled.
04/01/24, 16:31 - Faith EWYL23E0740: Ok
04/01/24, 16:31 - Ananya: B. *Visiting schools physically*

‚ñ™Ô∏è Now by this, as it clearly says, you have to visit schools nearby and inform them about Edoofa.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Visiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏è With this, you will surely gain a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, overcome the fear of presenting yourself and your family Edoofa, spontaneously in front of anyone at any point.
04/01/24, 16:33 - Faith EWYL23E0740: Following
04/01/24, 16:36 - Ananya: This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success
‚ñ™Ô∏èVisiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
‚ñ™Ô∏èWith this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear of presenting himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.
04/01/24, 16:42 - Faith EWYL23E0740: Thank you for the motivation.i am looking forward to try my best in this as well
04/01/24, 16:51 - Ananya: Now that we are concluding our session I want to highlight that by our next session, I will craft a personalized monthly plan for each of you, providing insight and guidance for your project work. You will have the opportunity to work towards covering a set portion of your education fees each month. This is a practice I implement annually with my students, and the positive impact has been remarkable.
As we navigate through the first week, I've assessed your fees, and based on my calculations, connecting with four students this week to submit their forms under your community-building project will help compensate for the time lost. So all the best for your new set target!
04/01/24, 16:54 - Faith EWYL23E0740: Noted with thanks
11/01/24, 15:30 - Faith EWYL23E0740: I am a proud edoofian

11/01/24, 18:52 - Ananya: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you today! I was not feeling well since morning however I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.
Not only this, but we also welcomed various industrial leaders, and it went super well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

15/01/24, 15:39 - Ananya: Good morning, Faith!

How are you doing today? I'm excited to share that we have beautifully decorated the walls of our office gallery! The space now reflects creativity and inspiration. I am so excited to add our photo here as well!üöÄü§ùüèΩ

15/01/24, 15:44 - Ananya: For today, I have planned something special! Do you know about a resume or a CV?
15/01/24, 15:46 - Faith EWYL23E0740: Yes but I have never did one before
15/01/24, 15:51 - Ananya: You know, a resume is like a super important paper for students. It shows all the cool things you've done in school and outside. When you want to get into a good school or get a job, you give them your resume so they can see how awesome you are. It's like your personal advertisement that says, 'Hey, I'm really good at these things, and I can do great stuff for you!' So, having a good resume helps you stand out and get cool opportunities.
15/01/24, 15:53 - Faith EWYL23E0740: Ok I understand.so does this resume have a format on how to write it
15/01/24, 15:54 - Ananya: Well, yesterday I was updating my little brother's resume and took help from this video. I thought to share this with you as well, as he is suggesting some really good things!
https://youtu.be/QnUI3sLZ4hc?si=HTbUElM6TNHZaPlN
15/01/24, 16:01 - Faith EWYL23E0740: Interesting
15/01/24, 16:04 - Ananya: Alright! Now, please watch this video and create a resume by our next session. As of now, let us now discuss your EWYL project. Now moving ahead I want to discuss something significant with you. You know, seeing over 400 students in this event has motivated me to work for my students even harder. I want you to be here in India and pay your fee all by yourself. For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed with a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?
15/01/24, 16:08 - Faith EWYL23E0740: Ok I understand
15/01/24, 16:08 - Faith EWYL23E0740: No I haven't taken any feedback

26/10/23, 13:39 - Ananya: Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Dedicated Line. I wish you all the best and I am here to support you throughout your academic journey. 

I want you to go through these points quickly.

I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.
It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.
Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.

18/11/23, 16:17 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
