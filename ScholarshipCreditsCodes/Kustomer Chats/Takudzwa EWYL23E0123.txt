How are you?
18/08/23, 13:08 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
18/08/23, 13:08 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù
18/08/23, 13:08 - Saloni Rastogi: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
18/08/23, 13:09 - Saloni Rastogi: Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *12:00-01:30 PM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
18/08/23, 13:09 - Saloni Rastogi: Are you ready for it?
18/08/23, 14:16 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0123: I am a proud EDOOFIAN

Get ready to embark on a journey of creativity as for today's Saturday Activity you have the opportunity to craft a short story based on one of the following three values:

1. Perseverance:
Write about a character who faces obstacles and perseveres to achieve success. Show their journey as they conquer adversity and emerge stronger.

2. Diversity and Inclusion:
Feature characters from different backgrounds, initially in conflict due to their differences. Show how their relationships evolve as they learn to value and celebrate each other's perspectives.

3. Gratitude:
Follow a character who learns to appreciate life's beauty and express gratitude for the people and experiences that enrich their life. Explore their growth as they foster appreciation and inspire others.

Choose a value that resonates with you. Your words can evoke emotions and leave a lasting impression. We eagerly await your creative stories that reflect the values shaping our lives.

Happy writing!

28/08/23, 13:38 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0123: My network was very poor
28/08/23, 14:02 - Saloni Rastogi: Takudzwa, you did not receive the weekend activity since you had not followed the daily ritual on Friday.
28/08/23, 14:03 - Saloni Rastogi: Did you try connecting with your parents' device during that time?
28/08/23, 14:07 - Takudzwa EWYL23E0123: Yes i tried but I didn't see anything

31/08/23, 13:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Takudzwa!
I trust you're doing well. 

It came to my attention that you missed out on yesterday's Wednesday lesson, which is a crucial part of our daily routine. To ensure you don't miss out on valuable content in the future, please remember to participate in our daily ritual of affirming, 'I am a proud edoofian' each morning.
I'm thrilled to share this week's lesson with you, and I guarantee it will captivate your heart. Please dive into it with enthusiasm and thoroughness. Your commitment to these rituals ensures you won't miss out on the progress we're making.
31/08/23, 13:16 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

So for this week's Wednesday lesson,  I have an exciting topic to delve into: Hidden Talent.
We'll dive into the captivating story of Samuel, a character whose seemingly ordinary life takes a fascinating turn when his secret talent comes to light. Through his story, we'll discover the power of talents that lie beneath the surface, waiting for the perfect moment to shine.
So, bring your curiosity and imagination as we delve into Samuel's tale and discuss the significance of hidden talents in our own lives. You might even find yourself reflecting on your own unique abilities that are yet to be revealed.

In our upcoming session I would like to know if you have a hidden talent that you're particularly good at or passionate about? It could be anything ‚Äì from artistic pursuits to something more unexpected.

Get ready to be inspired, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together!
31/08/23, 13:16 - Saloni Rastogi: .
31/08/23, 14:32 - Saloni Rastogi: I would like to end the session by saying that:

Hidden talents are like sparkling gems waiting to be discovered in the depths of our souls. They are the beautiful secrets that each of us carries, often concealed by the noise of everyday life. What makes them truly magnificent is the element of surprise they bring when they finally emerge. These talents are the unexpected strokes of genius, the melodies of the heart, and the sparks of creativity that add unique colors to the canvas of our lives. Having a hidden talent is like possessing a precious treasure chest of abilities that can enrich our existence and connect us with our true selves. It's a reminder of the limitless potential that resides within each individual, waiting for the right moment to dazzle the world.

How are you?

The Saturday activity was on the reflection of a great personality and all these experiments with his life that took him one step ahead of thousands of others.
But I see since you did not follow the daily ritual on Saturday, you have not received the activity. Let me share it with you now, along with the Wednesday lesson pdf too.
11/09/23, 13:18 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings, Proud Edoofians,

I trust you are in good spirits.

I trust this message finds you thriving. As we continue our academic journey, I encourage you to consider an opportunity that holds the potential to become a lucrative income source in the coming 3-4 years.

I firmly believe that among your assignments and projects, there lie gems with the power to generate income. Whether it's a distinctive skill, a project close to your heart, or an inventive concept, the time is ripe for us to embark on this exploration together. Your commitment and creativity may pave the way for a prosperous financial future.

During our Wednesday session, we learned about a wedding planner who leveraged his expertise to become a sales consultant. What's more, he now hosts his podcast, bolstering his income. I'm eager to hear your reflections on this subject.

Please do not hesitate to share any opportunities you believe you can pursue. We will delve deeper into your responses in our forthcoming discussions.

Here's to an exciting journey of discovery!

Warm regards,
TEAM EWYL!

Monday to Sunday, that is all seven days, you have to follow the daily ritual. Here are specific guidelines for each day:


*Tuesday* - We will have our session from 12:00-01:30 PM where we will discuss your Saturday activity task, and then we will discuss how we can accelerate our performance on projects.

09/12/23, 21:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Our journey as Edoofians is all about growth, dedication, and making a meaningful impact. üåç Let's get started and make every moment count! üöÄüåü
09/12/23, 21:53 - Saloni Rastogi: Happy Saturday!

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!
