07/10/22, 20:58 - Unknown: Greetings Lorraine!
How are you?
07/10/22, 21:00 - Unknown: As students, we constantly learn and expose ourselves to situations that help us learn anything and everything, but we must remember that each of us has the same number of hours in a day. Hence we must treat it important that we treat our Time as the currency of life. *Time Management* is essentially Priority Management.

In our session today on the *EWYL Line*, we will discuss:
1. How managing time is necessary
2. pending discussion on the weekend activity
07/10/22, 21:03 - Unknown: I am happy to hear you out on this Lorraine. It is very necessary that I teach my students how to MANAGE TIME even after school and work at home.
One who can do that is a HERO, and one who fails, life gives ZERO attention to them.
Let me share something with you regarding the same.
07/10/22, 21:50 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: Thank you Ma'am
07/10/22, 21:53 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: Managing time is important because you are able to perform your tasks and have track on the tasks that are pending

08/10/22, 18:30 - Unknown: The progress so far with the responses and following the proud edoofian ritual is not well.
Along with this, what I am concerned more about is our scholarship target for this month that you have set, how are we going to achieve that?
We need to plan that and work on it from today onwards.
I don't expect any late back attitude from you, I want to work very hard for you but it will only fructify when you will put equivalent and solid efforts into that.
-Tell me what project are you choosing
- how are you working on it
- per day target to achieve the same
08/10/22, 18:50 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: Morning ma'am I have been sending my responses and you haven't checked on them

09/10/22, 16:10 - Unknown: But did you think about the projects?
09/10/22, 16:10 - Unknown: Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. Those unfamiliar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video-creating apps.
We are intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.
Responses will be accepted on the *EWYL Line* only.
_Till then keep following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'_.

Happy learning and enjoy your weekend!

How are you?
12/10/22, 18:35 - Unknown: I saw the video again and I was thinking late at night that what was missing in your video. I felt that Lorraine the video could have been shot more professionally. Take an instance, where you have worn a shirt, have a decent background, stable camera; the video would have looked more appealing and outshining.
12/10/22, 18:52 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: Im fine and you Ma'am

13/10/22, 01:01 - Unknown: I am doing well, thanks for asking.
13/10/22, 01:01 - Unknown: We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real-life example. That is how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because in the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.
Responses will be submitted on the EWYL Line only.

I am having issues with the EWYL Line while downloading it.
12/07/22, 07:10 - Unknown: Please LORRAINE, I would appreciate if you would in a similar way submit your response for the Wednesday lesson as well.
12/07/22, 15:38 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: A student should have effective communication, to be able to take care of the tasks given,the student needs constantly communication from stakeholder meetings.Poor communication may lead to inefficiency and missed deadlines.Managing resources, engaging suppliers , dealing with team conflicts, leading a project means constantly being involved in negotiations.The student needs to be an effective negotiator with the ability to keep involved parties content.Time management is also a need because common project failure involve poor planning and good time management increase chances of delivering successful projects.The student needs to have strong leadership skills  ,by effectively coaching , guiding and motivating  co-workers you can move a project forward and deliver positive outcome.Risk management is essential as it involves identifying and planning for potential risks and is also critical for project management.Lastly a student should have critical thinking and problem solving.It is  particularly useful in the project management discipline.You must be able to use critical thinking skills to navigate through ambiguous projects.
12/07/22, 19:43 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: I already submitted my response
13/07/22, 01:00 - Unknown: Hello LORRAINE!
How's your day going?
13/07/22, 01:00 - Unknown: I am really glad to hear your understanding of the activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY* . They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost up, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.
13/07/22, 01:02 - Unknown: I am sorry Lorraine but I have not received any response from your side on the Wednesday lesson.
It's great if you have shared that, can you please resend it so that we can discuss that too?
13/07/22, 16:15 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: A student should have effective communication, to be able to take care of the tasks given,the student needs constantly communication from stakeholder meetings.Poor communication may lead to inefficiency and missed deadlines.Managing resources, engaging suppliers , dealing with team conflicts, leading a project means constantly being involved in negotiations.The student needs to be an effective negotiator with the ability to keep involved parties content.Time management is also a need because common project failure involve poor planning and good time management increase chances of delivering successful projects.The student needs to have strong leadership skills  ,by effectively coaching , guiding and motivating  co-workers you can move a project forward and deliver positive outcome.Risk management is essential as it involves identifying and planning for potential risks and is also critical for project management.Lastly a student should have critical thinking and problem solving.It is  particularly useful in the project management discipline.You must be able to use critical thinking skills to navigate through ambiguous projects.
13/07/22, 21:32 - Unknown: Hello Lorraine!
How's your day going?
13/07/22, 21:35 - Unknown: In this response Lorraine you have talked about the qualities and skills that a student is required to have in order to avail these projects and I am very sure that you know that this was a part of the weekend activity that was shared with you on 10\/07\/2022.
Lorraine, I have happily acknowledged your weekend activity response but I am asking you about your response on the WEDNESDAY WISDOM that was shared with you on 06\/07\/2022.
13/07/22, 21:37 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: Im fine and you ma'am?

13/07/22, 22:18 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: On the lesson I learnt that one need to have perseverance and hardwork to be successful potrayed by the Skooqs founder who did not quit but came up with another amazing idea in 5 days.
13/07/22, 23:10 - Unknown: I read your response and I must say that your opinions and views reflect clarity of idea. Not just this, your simplified understanding of our  young African entrepreneur,
*Oluwadamilola Soyombo* assures me that you have that zeal and passion to turn your dreams and ambitions into a _big successful reality_. 
The main idea behind this is to you realize that where there is a DESIRE to work hard, there is always a PATH that can take you to favorable outcomes. I know you are putting in all your efforts and I very well appreciate them, but I know you are capable to do much more than this, it is just about taking one more step ahead of others that will make you outshine in this crowd of millions of people.
This project also highlighted Edoofa's Training and Development partner Skooqs.

How are you doing today?
15/07/22, 20:24 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: Greetings Ma'am how are you
15/07/22, 20:24 - Unknown: From his dad’s small foray into entrepreneurship, Patrice Motsepe got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe’s success story is a remarkable one showing how curiosity, doggedness, perseverance, and the knack to exploit great opportunities as they come, can determine how successful or not, any individual could become. 
And this was all about our WEDNESDAY WISDOM.
Hope you have gone through it.
I am so excited to listen to your thoughts and views HERE.
15/07/22, 20:24 - Unknown: I am doing great Lorraine, thanks for asking.
15/07/22, 20:53 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: Yes I have ma'am, I have learnt that the level of determination, perseverance , focus and hardwork can determine success in life
15/07/22, 22:23 - Unknown: I read your response LORRAINE and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a WAY. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. We can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.
16/07/22, 00:58 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: Yes noted Thank you ma'am
16/07/22, 01:04 - Unknown: So Lorraine tell me, how many schools did you connect with to work on your School connect project (Project number 3)?
22/07/22, 22:54 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: The fast growing industry\/sector\/business in Zimbabwe is the Agriculture sector.Agriculture is the backbone of Zimbabwe’s economy as Zimbabweans remain largely a rural people who derive their livelihood from agriculture and other related rural economic activities. Agricultural activities provide employment and income for 60-70 percent of the population, supplies 60 percent of the raw materials required by the industrial sector and contributes 40 percent of total export earnings. Agriculture contributes approximately 17 percent to Zimbabwe’s GDP. As the main source of livelihood for the majority of the population, the performance of agriculture is a key determinant of rural livelihood resilience and poverty levels. 
 The General challenges facing smallholder farmers (SHF’s) include low and erratic rainfall, low and declining soil fertility, low investment, shortages of farm power - labour and draft animals, poor physical and institutional infrastructure, poverty and recurring food insecurity. Agricultural production is also vulnerable to periodic droughts. The peasant sector, which produces 70 per cent of staple foods (maize, millets, and groundnuts), is particularly vulnerable as it has access to less than 5 per cent of national irrigation facilities.
Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy and it provides vertical and horizontal linkages to other economic sectors. It is also a source of the much needed agro-based raw materials. The sector is also linked with other major sectors of the economy, as it provides the much needed agro based raw materials.

Foreigners are free to invest in the sector through contract farming arrangements. Opportunities include provision of financial and technical services, greenhouse production of vegetables and flowers, fruits production, livestock production, dairy farming tobacco farming, soya bean production and many others.
The sector is not limited to the above and includes investment opportunities in a th
22/07/22, 22:55 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: Greetings Ma'am this is my 16 July task, my apologies for the late response
22/07/22, 23:27 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Lorraine!
How's your day going?
22/07/22, 23:28 - Unknown: I read your response Lorraine and it made me so inquisitive to know more about agriculture in Zimbabwe look what I found  is overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture. Agriculture accounts for 18% of Zimbabwe's GDP as of 2015. Agriculture enabled people to produce surplus food. There are different crops that farmers grow and some of these include, maize, sorghum, rapoko, groundnuts, round-nuts, and beans.''
Your response reflects clarity in the way you have expressed and so thoughtfully you have penned down your thoughts.
22/07/22, 23:28 - Unknown: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.
22/07/22, 23:30 - Unknown: Along with this, let's move on with our session.
Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our WEDNESDAY Wisdom was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
23/07/22, 00:08 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: Noted ma'am
23/07/22, 02:41 - Unknown: Please share your response Lorraine, I am so excited to discuss with you.
23/07/22, 20:41 - Unknown: Good morning Lorraine!
How did your day go?
23/07/22, 20:41 - Unknown: Lorraine I would request you to please share a picture of the certificate that you received from the meet and greet.
23/07/22, 21:18 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: Morning ma'am how are you
24/07/22, 00:20 - Unknown: I am doing great, thanks for asking.
24/07/22, 00:20 - Unknown: Thank you for sharing.
24/07/22, 04:16 - Unknown: Lorraine please share your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
24/07/22, 06:30 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: From the Wednesday wisdom , I have learnt about the right attitude approach life  . One shouldn't blame anyone for their failure or mistakes instead they should  make other efforts and never get discouraged. Perseverance is a key to success, when things get tough one should not be quick to give up instead they must try again and success does not transpire overnight.
25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

25/07/22, 18:53 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

26/07/22, 17:44 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: A growth mindset of people successful  understand talents and abilities can develop through effort ,good teaching and persistence .The mindset believes that not everyone is the same but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.The growth mindset encourage superior leaning habits . It does not just encourage effort but successful strategies and learning habits.Growth mindsets lead to positive mental well-being and positive development.Those praised for their effort exhibit  more perseverance and overall happiness.The growth mindset improves workplace and career skills .Studies show that growth mindset have improved negotiation skills compared to fixed mindsets.As I have become part of the Edoofa community l strive to put more Effort in everything I do for desirable results. The tasks and projects will require more effort therefore I am aiming for the growth mindset.I also believe that with the higher education I am acquiring in India , I will be previledged to have good teachings and skills to later approach the world with successful strategies.

26/07/22, 21:21 - Unknown: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

Yesterday I had an amazing day. I went to the airport to receive all my proud Edoofians and I had tears in my eyes seeing their happiness and enthusiasm. I want you to look at it and share your thoughts with me here.
26/07/22, 21:33 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: Greetings , I am filled with joy upon seeing my mates finally arrive in India , it gives me more assurance that I will also get the Same experience
26/07/22, 21:34 - Unknown: I read your response to the Wednesday wisdom and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
26/07/22, 21:35 - Unknown: Along with this, I read your understanding of the weekend activity and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it’s not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you’re looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don’t do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.

31/07/22, 21:32 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. \r
﻿\r
So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!\r
﻿\r
Happy Weekend!\r

How's your day going?
03/08/22, 00:47 - Unknown: A timetable is a framework that lets individuals see specific activities lined up. In this framework, it shows the tie allotment among several tasks and courses. It ensures equal distribution of time among activities and subjects, creates a smooth workflow, prevents wasting of time and efforts, and aids in creating good habits.
The *weekend activity* asked you to draw a timetable for yourself and of course, have time for your scheduled sessions as well.
I am really excited to see your timetable on the EWYL Line and of course, we can discuss how we can manage our sessions accordingly.
In this session today, we will discuss:
1. your timetable (as a part of the weekend activity)
2. progress on community building projects
3. pending understanding wednesday lesson
03/08/22, 00:48 - Unknown: You can share your timetable in this format.
03/08/22, 00:49 - Unknown: Also I see you have not followed our daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian'.

04/08/22, 17:07 - Lorraine EWYL21E0873: In the Wednesday lesson, I have learned that time management is the ability to use your time  productively and efficiently.One must arrange a list of things to do in an order of importance.For one to efficiently manage time they must not delay to do work but as soon as possible they must get to their tasks.
