The deadline to make the submission is *Tuesday* *3 PM*. Please make sure that you submit your response before that because the *Academic Board* keeps a very strict check on these things.

Nicolene, May I know what did we discuss in our last session?
12/07/22, 22:31 - Nicolene EWYL20E0031: You were elaborating on what it means being a proud Edoofian
12/07/22, 22:33 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

19/07/22, 18:20 - Nicolene EWYL20E0031: One of the fast growing industries in South Africa is agriculture and agro-processing.

The agriculture sector contributes massively to the Gross Domestic Products of the country due to the ever growing population thats eventually leads to a hugh demand in food supplies meaning, the best agric industry to be involved in would be the food and beverage sector.

The sector always gives postive results in growth each quarter that ends. Inorder to be successful in this industry, one could look into selling of agricultural supplies such as agrochemicals or machinery.

The agro-processing sector relies on the positive outcomes of the agric industry that makes trades and exports lead to a growing successful industry, one could be involved in the coffe industry, sugar industry and vegetable oil industry.

To have a direction in serving a basis for the farm business plan, SWOT Analysis is the way forward,

Strength 
-Suitable geographical conditions
-Large domestic demands
-Huge natural resources

Weakness
- Lack of finance
-Complex export procedure
-Limited access to technology
-Insufficient veterinary and food safety

Opportunity
-More employment
-Utilisation of natural resources
-Value addition
-Increased marketing span

Threats
-Price fluctuations
-Bad trade practices
-Global competition

Overall if the above farm analysis is put into action, there is a great possibility of having  a  very successful business plan in agriculture and agro-processing industries

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
