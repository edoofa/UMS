07/10/23, 13:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!

How are you?
07/10/23, 13:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Before we begin, as you have come on the EWYL Line, you have already completed some basic formalities. Now, I would like to talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.
I kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let me know.
07/10/23, 14:03 - Mark EWYL23E0409: As per your recommendations whats the best way forward
07/10/23, 16:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Done, we have kept the program on hold. Thank you!
