18/05/23, 22:24 - Zolani EWYL22E1263: From the Wednesday wisdom lesson I grasped that leadership is not always traditional but there is the concept of servant leadership. This leadership is mainly about leading to serve. Thïs type of leadership is characterised by being considerate of the employees' needs and mainly focuses on developing them likewise. In the being a servant leadership there are a number of characteristics that should be adopted likely good listening skills, inténse commitment to the growth of the employees, being empathetic, stewardship, community building skills, conceptualisation, positive awareness, healing, persuasive abilities and clear constructive foresight.

29/05/23, 15:28 - Jasmine Kaur: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
29/05/23, 15:48 - Jasmine Kaur: Good Afternoon dear
How are you doing?
29/05/23, 20:24 - Zolani EWYL22E1263: Powerful
29/05/23, 20:24 - Zolani EWYL22E1263: I'm doing great ma'am how are you
30/05/23, 17:41 - Zolani EWYL22E1263: *COMMUNITY BUILDING*
02/06/23, 12:55 - Zolani EWYL22E1263: This week's wisdom earning is about associating with positive minded individuals. The whole concept revolves around the idea of positivity as the sole building block to success. Associating with individuals that emit positive energy gives inspiration, encouragement and a positive mindset. Positive minded people motivate us to grow as they believe in our potential and encourage us in every step towards success. Apart from motivating us they uplift our moods and foster a growth oriented mentality. The environment they offer is conducive for self awareness, growth and improvement. In conclusion associating with positive minded individuals is key to success.
02/06/23, 12:56 - Zolani EWYL22E1263: *I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN*
02/06/23, 12:56 - Jasmine Kaur:  Dear Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well.
 Our founders recently embarked on an incredible journey, where they met with our passionate Edoofians and witnessed the impact of our program firsthand.

Share your feelings and expressions in the comments!!
08/06/23, 16:28 - Zolani EWYL22E1263: Thank you very much
08/06/23, 16:29 - Jasmine Kaur: Good afternoon dear!
I hope this message finds you well and in high spirits. It's time for our session.

Let's make the most of this afternoon's session! Get ready to engage, ask questions, share your thoughts, and challenge yourselves to reach new heights. Remember, success is not measured solely by the outcome but by the effort, growth, and resilience you display along the way.
Let us start this session by going through your lesson. Were you able to complete the lesson?
08/06/23, 16:44 - Zolani EWYL22E1263: Yes I was
08/06/23, 16:51 - Jasmine Kaur: Well done, What did you learn from the lesson?
08/06/23, 16:59 - Zolani EWYL22E1263: Networking is crucial for existence. In building strong networks and professional relations, we become exposed and this is beneficial to us. I learnt also that adaptation and strategic pivoting helps us being proactive and therefore shaping our future into a better one
08/06/23, 17:04 - Jasmine Kaur: Please elaborate a bit Zolani and what part you liked the best.
08/06/23, 17:33 - Zolani EWYL22E1263: I grasped that the world is changing and there is need to adapt to these new environment. Certain aspects I mentioned earlier are therefore crucial for our existence. That is when we mentioned the idea of networking and building strong relations. As stated in the book; traditional career paths and job
security are becoming less reliable.. So in building new, strong and professional relations we expose ourselves to a business environment and this allows us to make a living and to shape our future for the better. In addition , having an entrepreneurial mindset is the best way to remain fit in a world where the survival is for the fittest. I also touched on the idea of strategic pivoting. Life has no given formula so adapting to different situations is what makes it bearable 

The part I liked the most was the idea of making connections. It is my belief that we are what because of our past connections. The future is uncertain but the connections we make will determine how it turns at the end.
08/06/23, 17:41 - Jasmine Kaur: Let me go through it.
08/06/23, 17:43 - Jasmine Kaur: It's wonderful to see how well you've understood the changing dynamics of the world and the importance of adapting to new environments. You've highlighted some crucial aspects, such as networking, building strong relations, and embracing an entrepreneurial mindset, which are indeed vital for our existence and shaping a better future.
08/06/23, 17:43 - Jasmine Kaur: Well done Zolani
08/06/23, 17:43 - Zolani EWYL22E1263: Okay ma'am
08/06/23, 17:43 - Zolani EWYL22E1263: Thank you
08/06/23, 17:43 - Jasmine Kaur: So, now I would like to take an update about your progress in the EWYL projects.
08/06/23, 17:43 - Zolani EWYL22E1263: Thank you
08/06/23, 17:45 - Zolani EWYL22E1263: I was still looking for the principal's contact details from Mpopoma High School... Then on the fresh forms I haven't received any yet
08/06/23, 18:37 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, What about Community Building?

This weekend we go back to the basics of EWYL with our 3 important keys! 
 Link: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtPOMh0pgPs/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA== 

Share in the comments if you have known this before and why is it important!!
10/06/23, 11:57 - Zolani EWYL22E1263: Absolutely
10/06/23, 16:00 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

SATURDAY ACTIVITY
Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week’s Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better—together. It’s why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger—as successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!
10/06/23, 17:23 - Zolani EWYL22E1263: Thank you.. Will do so
