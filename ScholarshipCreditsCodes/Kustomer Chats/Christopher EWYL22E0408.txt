04/10/22, 19:05 - Christopher EWYL22E0408: Good morning mentor
04/10/22, 19:06 - Unknown: Edoofian, this is to inform you that we will have a discussion around your projects tomorrow. Last week I gave you a task in which you had to submit 1 school , 1 company and 5 community building forms. I hope it is completed by now, hence I would need updates today.
04/10/22, 19:06 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Below is your weekend task!

I will take an update on Monday *10 AM*
Hello my dear Edoofians
Hope you are doing well. This week we learned about one of the most popular yet grounded people who used social media as a tool to become an educator and give back to the community and still become an entrepreneur.
This week I want you to reflect on what your strengths and skills are to become a social media community leader. Also, share any experience or instance where you were able to showcase these skills and strengths. 

These skills can range from creativity, video making, camera etiquette, designing, writing content etc.
Please share these skills and instances where you were able to showcase these skills on Monday
Till then 
Happy Learning!
