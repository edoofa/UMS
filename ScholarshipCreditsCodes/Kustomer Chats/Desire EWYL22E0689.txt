07/02/23, 18:51 - Jasmine Kaur: South Sudan, officially the Republic of South Sudan, is a landlocked country in East Africa. It is bordered by Ethiopia, Sudan, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda and Kenya. South Sudan is home to several national parks and game reserves, including Southern and Badingilo national parks, located in the south.

07/02/23, 18:53 - Desire EWYL22E0689: Wow, that's really enlightening. Thank you
07/02/23, 19:01 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attr

From the lesson i learnt that i should be consistent in all my actions to build strong relationships with everyone especially my mentor☺️
11/07/23, 15:53 - Desire EWYL22E0689: For project two, that is the Community building I've searched for students but it seems like most of them have already applied for programs to Universities in Zimbabwe, is it still ok if I talk to students who are to write for their senior secondary exam this year
11/07/23, 16:03 - Jasmine Kaur: Okay, Let us talk one by one. First of all, May I know that did you receive the Saturday Activity?
11/07/23, 16:06 - Desire EWYL22E0689: Do you mean the Wednesday Wisdom document?
11/07/23, 16:11 - Jasmine Kaur: No, I am talking about the Saturday Activity.
11/07/23, 16:11 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

Its time for our Saturday Activity, I want you to delve into the realm of inspiration and write a detailed essay about a person whom you know personally and who embodies the remarkable trait of consistency. This individual has consistently demonstrated their dedication, determination, and unwavering commitment, becoming a true source of inspiration for you.

In your essay, please explore the key aspects of their life, experiences, and actions that exemplify their consistent nature. Describe how their consistent approach has positively influenced and impacted not only their own life but also the lives of those around them. Reflect on specific instances or situations where their consistent behavior or mindset has motivated you to strive for excellence or overcome challenges in your own life.

Feel free to include personal anecdotes, observations, or conversations that highlight the impact this person's consistency has had on your growth and development. Additionally, analyze the qualities, values, or strategies that you believe contribute to their ability to maintain consistency over time.
I am excited to read your insightful essays and learn about the inspiring individuals who have demonstrated the power of consistency.
Best regards,

11/07/23, 16:53 - Desire EWYL22E0689: Yes, i did some dig up on students who have recently graduated from their senior secondary school for project 2, but it seems like most of them have already applied for programs to Universities in Zimbabwe. Is it ok if I talk to students who are to write for their senior secondary exam this year
11/07/23, 17:01 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, you can reach out to those students as well. I would like to tell you that right now admissions of 2023 and 2024 are open.
11/07/23, 17:22 - Desire EWYL22E0689: Ooh that's great, I'll tell my colleagues about that ma'am
11/07/23, 17:25 - Jasmine Kaur: Yes, Let me share some information with you that will help you out.
11/07/23, 17:25 - Jasmine Kaur: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.

11/07/23, 17:54 - Jasmine Kaur: Oh yes, I forgot. Let me do that.
11/07/23, 17:56 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe.
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

13/07/23, 00:13 - Desire EWYL22E0689: Consistency is a critical driver for success. Being consistent means dedicating yourself to goals and activities to achieve them. Growing up, my brother made sure he took an hour to two hours, twice a day studying and doing school work. He was really consistent with his actions from form 3 to form 6. I asked him one day what he wanted to do when he grows up and he said he want to be a software engineer. He was really consistent with his studying actions and this made him to perform wonders in his academics. When he passed his junior secondary school level, it was now like a challenge to me to break the record of results set by my brother. When he wrote his senior secondary school exam and got 13 points, I was really delighted but on the other hand i knew my brother had gave me a challenge. One day i realized one thing, my brother wasn't only working hard at school for himself but he was also leading by example to us, his fellow siblings. From that day i had to work up early studying with him. Most of my nearby friends ended up joining us in the afternoon at weekends when we were studying. As far as books are consened my mother always new that my brother always takes care of us.

18/07/23, 11:35 - Desire EWYL22E0689: Good morning ma'am, my business personality is an entrepreneur called Strive Masiyiwa.He is the founder and chairman of the global telecommunications group Econet Wireless. Initially, he briefly worked as a telecoms engineer for the state owned telephone company, he quit this job and set up his job with the equivalent of UDS$75.Econet Wireless was created in Zimbabwe by Strive Masiyiwa in 1993 and initially it was meant to be called Enhanced Communications Network but was later abbreviated Econet. Strive overcame protracted government opposition to launch mobile phone network Econet Wireless in Zimbabwe in 1998. From the past 20 years, Strive Masiyiwa has provided scholarships to over 250 000 young Africans through his family foundation. He has also supported more than 40 000 orphans with education initiatives and sponsored students at universities America, United Kingdom, China etc.

Strive Masiyiwa was really consistent and he understood that he had to look forward towards his goal no matter the business competition. Strive also believed that it doesn't matter how tough the goal was, if he persist and do a little every moment, he would be able to achieve it. More so, he knew that it does not matter what others are able to do or not able to do, goal achievement meant that he had to do his piece consistently. Inoder to win, he needs to put in work steadily even it is slow. He understood that doing what you need to do slowly and steadily day in and day out makes goal achievement effortless.He took time to do the right things at the right time. In conclusion, you can only find opportunities when you are looking for them.

21/07/23, 16:30 - Desire EWYL22E0689: I've read and understood the very interesting and motivating Wednesday Wisdom. I Also want to be a leader myself but for me to be a great and effective leader i have to lead by example. My actions should speak louder than words. I should be a role model by demonstrating the qualities I wish to see in others. Moreso i should build strong relationships with everyone fostering a sense of belonging and connection by actively listening, offering support and showing genuine interest in others. 

Effective communication is greatly a fundamental skill a great leader should possess. A good leader should express good communication skills through expressing ideas clearly and listening attentively to others. Taking initiatives is also influential for a good student leader. A good student leader should identify areas of improvement or initiatives that can benefit your community and take the initiative to address them. A significant part of being a good student leader is actively trying engaging in community services, identifying needs within my community and take initiatives to address them. Above all, leadership is a continuous learning and growing journey, seeking opportunities for self improvement and skill development through attending leadership workshops, conferences, leadership training programs, reading articles and books on leadership.
