08/11/23, 14:03 - Aditi Kapoor: So may I know your plan of action on how you would be moving forward with your projects?
08/11/23, 14:07 - Lushomo EWYL23E0681: I have managed to contact the Headmaster from the nearest school and contacted her already. Have scheduled a meeting so far. As for the other schools lam still making an effort to get their contacts. Unfortunately most contact details for head masters are personal contacts and private so they are hesitant to share. However the larger part of the efforts currently is to establish communications and share with them the edoofa program so that most graduating students may stand a chance to benefit from the program
08/11/23, 14:17 - Aditi Kapoor: That's excellent to hear that you've already taken the initiative to contact the Headmaster of the nearest school and have a meeting scheduled. Your dedication to expanding the reach of the Edoofa program is commendable. I understand that obtaining contact information for other schools' headmasters can be challenging, but your efforts in establishing communication and sharing the program's opportunities are essential in giving graduating students a chance to benefit from it. Keep up the good work, and I wish you success in your outreach efforts! If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to ask.
08/11/23, 14:19 - Lushomo EWYL23E0681: Thank you for the commendation. I will do my best and everything is clear for now
08/11/23, 14:23 - Aditi Kapoor: That's amazing!
08/11/23, 14:43 - Aditi Kapoor: Concluding our session, I want to express how delightful our conversation has been and now I am sharing this week's Wednesday lesson with you.
08/11/23, 14:43 - Aditi Kapoor: Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

16/11/23, 13:55 - Lushomo EWYL23E0681: Hello and good day to you too. Yes am ready
16/11/23, 13:57 - Aditi Kapoor: I am sharing this week's lesson go through it and share your understanding with me.
You missed it as you didn't follow your daily ritual, make sure you follow it everyday.
16/11/23, 13:57 - Aditi Kapoor: Wednesday wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

16/11/23, 14:30 - Aditi Kapoor: We didn't get to some key discussions; please participate actively in the sessions and also share your understanding of the Lesson with me before 3:00 PM today.
16/11/23, 14:38 - Lushomo EWYL23E0681: Mastering our circumstances has reminded me what Mahatma Ghandi once said "Be the change that you wish to see in the world". This brings out valuable lessons on how one can navigate through obstacles life presents and using them as stepping stones to shape our destiny in life.This can only be possible with the right mindset we adopt, the choices we make in life and surrounding ourselves with positive influences. Every small or big decision we make daily shape our destiny and determines who we will become. Focusing on improving oneself may sound selfish but it's the only way leading to being selfless and ultimately contributing to society. By mastering yourself, one can forge their own destiny. It is the ultimate test one would ever face in life. It represents the ultimate goal in your life. Alex as given in the article used transformative power of mastering his circumstances through education and ultimately contributed positively to his society thereby benefitting larger part of members of his society. Its the power of a mindset, the power of mastery which encompasses self awareness, self knowledge and self development

17/11/23, 17:32 - Aditi Kapoor: Your reflection on mastering circumstances aligns beautifully with Mahatma Gandhi's powerful quote, "Be the change that you wish to see in the world." It indeed encapsulates valuable lessons on navigating life's obstacles and using them as stepping stones to shape our destinies. The essence lies in adopting the right mindset, making conscious choices, and surrounding ourselves with positive influences.
17/11/23, 17:35 - Lushomo EWYL23E0681: Thats right
18/11/23, 14:47 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,

21/11/23, 20:13 - Lushomo EWYL23E0681: Personal experience involves certain challenges l faced which included low self-esteem and anxiety. Some of the poorest decisions l have ever made have been under the influence of these emotions, and my actions were driven by fear. Over the years l have l experienced moments were l felt separate from my own life as if a strnger was in charge of my choices. These experiences were certainly not the most empowering. It took me time and a lot effort to realise that l have power over what l listen and influences my mind. I realized that l have power over my mind and behaviour and lam the only one who can deceide whether theres a more positive approach to let these emotions consume me or whether to simply feel them and let them go. In short l have developed the power over the dialogue in my mind.
21/11/23, 20:17 - Lushomo EWYL23E0681: The dreams l hold as a student is to focus on trying to get a prestigious scholarship. From my dreams stem my goals which provide a framework for personal and professional growth as well as decision making.

Attaining my dream might require a range of steps to get, not forgetting the obstacles to be encountered along the way
