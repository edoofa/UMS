Excuse me for we could not connect yesterday for our session.

Monday was a national holiday in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.
It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant imp

04/10/23, 14:11 - Unknown: Hello Triphine,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning

I hope this message finds you well. Today's "Wednesday Wisdom" session will delve into the topic of peak performance and the significance of focus in achieving success. We've all heard experts advise us to concentrate, eliminate distractions, and commit to mastering one thing. This guidance is undoubtedly valuable, and the more I study successful individuals from various fields—be it artists, athletes, entrepreneurs, or scientists—the more I am convinced that focus plays a pivotal role in their accomplishments.

Together, we'll explore strategies and ideas that can help you navigate the complex landscape of choices and find your true calling.
Read the PDF very carefully and we will connect in our upcoming session.

Till Then
Happy Learning!

12/10/23, 13:42 - Triphine EWYL23E0502: Peak  performance  experts  emphasize  on the  importance  of concentration  and  the  removal  of  distractions along  with  the recommendation  to  dedicate  oneself  to  a  single  pursuit  in  order  to excel.  This  counsel  holds  true  and  gains  credence  as  one delve  deeper into  the  accomplishments 
  across  diverse  fields ,be it  artists,  athletes,  entrepreneurs,  or  scientists.  It  increasingly becomes  evident  that  focus  serves  as  a  fundamental  pillar  of  success.
12/10/23, 13:42 - Triphine EWYL23E0502: Make  a  Call  About  What  to  Focus  On Assuming  you’re  willing  to  try  things  and  experiment .pay more attention to it . this  means measuring  something. I f  you’re  an  entrepreneur,  track  your  marketing  and  promotion efforts. I f  you’re  trying  to  gain  muscle, track  your  workouts. I f  you’re  learning  an  instrument, track   your  practice  sessions. Even  when  you  do  measure  things,  however,  there  comes  a  point where  one  have  to  make  a  call  and  decide  what  to  focus on. decision  is  one  of  the  central  tensions of entrepreneurship.  Have  time  to  simplify  and  focus  on  one thing,  .  That’s  what  makes  success  so  hard. Entrepreneurship  isn’t  like  baking  a  cake.  There  is  no  recipe. There  is  no  guidebook. At  this  stage,  your  best  option  is  to  decide.  You  can’t  try everything.  At  some  point,  you  don’t  need  more  information,  you j ust  need  to  make  a  choice. When you have  reached  the  stage  where  figuring  out  what  to  focus  on becomes  a  real  possibility. Now one would have  experimented  with  enough  ideas  to  discover   options  that  seem  to  provide  better  than  average  results  for  you.
