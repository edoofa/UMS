27/07/22, 00:19 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

27/07/22, 20:59 - Unknown: Greetings Prince!
How's your day going?
27/07/22, 21:06 - Unknown: I see you have typed 2, which means that you are unclear about who a proud edoofian is and what it denotes. Let me add to your understanding.
27/07/22, 21:06 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
27/07/22, 21:07 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
27/07/22, 21:34 - Prince EWYL22E0256: Going well and yours
27/07/22, 21:34 - Prince EWYL22E0256: Understood
28/07/22, 02:50 - Unknown: I am also doing great, thanks for asking.
29/07/22, 01:50 - Prince EWYL22E0256: *\"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'*
29/07/22, 01:51 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation.

How's your day going?
29/07/22, 19:39 - Unknown: Time management is defined as using your time productively and efficiently—but what about when you are working as productively as possible, and you still can’t get everything done? It may be better to think about time management as a combination of working productively and prioritizing your time.

Our *Wednesday Wisdom* was all about Time Management and understanding the priority matrix to organize our tasks. 
I am really excited to hear your understanding and working on the same.
Please share it with me here.
In today's session we will talk about:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. progress on community building projects.

How's your day going?
03/08/22, 01:31 - Unknown: A timetable is a framework that lets individuals see specific activities lined up. In this framework, it shows the tie allotment among several tasks and courses. It ensures equal distribution of time among activities and subjects, creates a smooth workflow, prevents wasting of time and efforts, and aids in creating good habits.
The *weekend activity* asked you to draw a timetable for yourself and of course, have time for your scheduled sessions as well.
I am really excited to see your timetable on the EWYL Line and of course, we can discuss how we can manage our sessions accordingly.
In this session today, we will discuss:
1. your timetable (as a part of weekend activity)
2. progress on community building projects
3. pending response to Wednesday Wisdom
03/08/22, 01:31 - Unknown: You can share the timetable in the given format.
04/08/22, 05:20 - Unknown: I will surely discuss it with you in your next session.
04/08/22, 05:20 - Unknown: Hello my proud edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Today's Wednesday lesson is providing us with the details of how a 19year old started his journey of a successful business and today has a majority market share in Zimbabwe, handling brand portfolios worth over $870 million. After you have read the pdf carefully share your major takeaways and the inspiration you got from Gilbert Eugene Peters. 

Happy learning!

09/08/22, 21:18 - Unknown: Greetings Justine!
One can be called successful if they have achieved their desired goals. For some people, being successful means being rich. But being successful is even more than being rich. When you achieve what you want, it gives you immense pleasure, and that is incomparable with being rich. To be successful in any aspect of life, one needs to have strong dedication and work hard. 
Our WEEKEND ACTIVITY discussed the traits of a successful person.
So, in our session today on the EWYL Line, we will:
1. discuss your understanding of the weekend activity.
2. make weekly plans on achieving targets on three ongoing projects.
