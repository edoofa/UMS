30/01/23, 19:30 - Unknown: Hello Nodumo, Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Line. Here we practice a 'mantra' where you should always start and end the day by saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' to boost your energy!
30/01/23, 19:34 - Nodumo EWYL22E0761: Well I am a proud Edoofian sir and I will enjoy this practice
30/01/23, 19:36 - Unknown: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
01/02/23, 19:40 - Unknown: Hello my proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
There is a lot of misunderstanding around LinkedIn. While some regard it as a job board, others see it as a social media network similar to Facebook. Both hypotheses are somewhat true, but unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is more focused on professionals, and unlike other job sites, LinkedIn offers more functionality than just job search.
In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we'll discuss how students can use LinkedIn to develop powerful professional networks. To fully understand the LinkedIn networking guidelines, read the PDF carefully.

Happy Learning!
01/02/23, 19:43 - Nodumo EWYL22E0761: Okaya sir, i will read it carefully
02/02/23, 01:19 - Unknown: I hope the wednesday wisdom is fruitful for you and we shall be discussing about the same in the next session.

06/02/23, 21:33 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, Let me share a small story with you!                                                                                                                                                                                       Ready??                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
06/02/23, 21:36 - Nodumo EWYL22E0761: The story is very inspiring sir, I can see that  Andy's hardwork was inspirational to the other ants too
06/02/23, 22:02 - Unknown: Awesome!

06/02/23, 23:19 - Nodumo EWYL22E0761: I am ready to create  a connection with someone on LinkedIn and as soon as I do that i will share my experience sir, i wanted to ask if the person who i will connect with are there any particular requirements that he\/she must possess? Like can i just connect with anyone or must it be someone in a certain line of work?
