19/08/22, 20:33 - Unknown: Hello Edoofian, how are you doing today?

Did you read my above message? Please respond to the same so we can have a conversation.
19/08/22, 20:37 - Unknown: Please share your response for the wednesday wisdm with me.
20/08/22, 01:11 - Prince EWYL21E0930: The concept of personal branding has gained momentum over the past few years as the job\r
market becomes more and more competitive.\r
But what is the definition of a personal brand?\r
Essentially, it’s a way for people to know what you’re all about: your ethos, your goals and\r
your mission in the professional world. We all know high-profile individuals with a personal\r
brand.\r
Think: Oprah Winfrey, Steve Jobs and various public figures and politicians. They have all\r
established an identity in the public realm – their personal brand – that enables others to\r
understand the type of person they are.\r
But beyond the hype, branding yourself is an important consideration within a professional\r
context. The pervasiveness of the internet and the flourishing of social networking sites has\r
made it essential for any professional with a presence on the internet and networking sites to\r
mould and manage their personal brand.\r
Why is building your personal brand important?\r
Your personal brand is critical because it is a representation of you that others are presented\r
with when they look for you online, as well as the image that you choose to project in face-to-\r
face interactions.\r
Whether we are aware of it or not, all of our activities online – on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter\r
or other social media platforms – form an online personal profile that is searchable. And\r
today, employers and recruiters are using the internet to conduct employment background\r
searches, and to gauge an idea of the character and interests of their potential employees.\r
Interestingly, 57% of employers are less likely to interview a candidate they can’t find online.\r
So actively creating a personal brand for yourself allows you to have a say in how you market\r
yourself and gives you control in crafting an accurate picture of your identity, rather than it\r
happening purely by default.\r
While social networking sites are predominate
20/08/22, 01:17 - Prince EWYL21E0930: it’s a way for people to know what you’re all about: your ethos, your goals and\r

20/08/22, 01:43 - Unknown: Amazing to read your response and work around personal branding. Your personal brand is  is a representation of you that others are presented with when they look for you online, as well as the image that you choose to project in face to face interactions.
20/08/22, 01:49 - Unknown: All of our activities online be it on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter or other social media platforms, form an online personal profile that is searchable. And today, *employers and recruiters* are using the internet to conduct employment background searches, and to gauge an idea of the character and interests of their potential employees. So you see, having an acclaimed personal brand is critical in helping you find bigger and better opportunities?
20/08/22, 01:56 - Prince EWYL21E0930: Yeah sure sir
20/08/22, 02:03 - Unknown: Now Prince, the best way to go about it is via following the steps that Ms Davi shared:

1. Figure out what you’re passionate about
2. Grow your social footprint: Via various social media and blogs
3. Make a plan for yourself: Both for your career and your branding
4. Tell a story: About your struggle, how your gained skills, what helped you and how you can help others
20/08/22, 02:04 - Prince EWYL21E0930: Okay sir

15/07/22, 20:48 - Unknown: WHat are your learnings from it?
16/07/22, 17:23 - Prince EWYL21E0930: I go through it and I have learned that to be successful you have to believing in your self and have passion, also you have to work hard
16/07/22, 21:50 - Unknown: Good work Prince, lets discuss it in our session on Monday. Please also send the Proud Edoofian message tomorrow. Let's not miss out the momentum even on Sunday.??
16/07/22, 22:15 - Prince EWYL21E0930: Okay great sir
20/07/22, 20:57 - Prince EWYL21E0930: How are you sir
20/07/22, 20:58 - Prince EWYL21E0930: Iam a proud Edoofian
20/07/22, 21:00 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!
