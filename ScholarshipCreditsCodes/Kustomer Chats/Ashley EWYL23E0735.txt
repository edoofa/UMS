If you could visit any famous landmark or natural wonder in the world, where would you go and why?
15/01/24, 23:04 - Ashley EWYL23E0735: I would go to France in Paris specifically to see the Eiffel tower
15/01/24, 23:05 - Ashley EWYL23E0735: The reason why I would go there is that it is nicknamed the city of love and it is a magnificent tower
15/01/24, 23:08 - Jasmine Kaur: That's a wonderful choice! Paris, with its romantic ambiance, and the iconic Eiffel Tower indeed make for an enchanting destination. The cultural richness, art, and history in the city add another layer of charm. Have you thought about any specific activities or places you would like to explore in Paris, aside from the Eiffel Tower?
15/01/24, 23:09 - Ashley EWYL23E0735: Not really but I would want to kno more about their culture and try their delicious famous food
