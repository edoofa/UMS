18/05/23, 13:57 - Margreth EWYL22E1157: Not yet ,mentor I think this project would be completed if I am in India because they don't take me serious ,here in Zimbabwe there are so many people who tick people about the schoolarhip on studying abroad so it will be difficult for them to trust me while they see that am in Zimbabwe

24/05/23, 18:12 - Tenzin: Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian!
Hope are doing well.

‚ÄúWhen I discover who I am, I'll be free.‚Äù ~ Ralph Ellison.

In the last week's lesson, we learned about the nature of a winner. This week's lesson would hence focus on how self-awareness helps in the true creation of a leader. Knowledge about the world is readily available and can be found in books, the internet, or other sources. But, to learn about one's own self is a true art only few can master, and it has been a fact that the ones who mastered their own personality traits and made themselves more aware. Rewrote history every time.
You will also learn about one such person, who spent most of their time with their own thoughts and became one of the most successful leaders globally.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn more about your own self and find your self-introspection switch.

Happy Learning.

29/05/23, 13:01 - Tenzin: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.

29/05/23, 13:35 - Margreth EWYL22E1157: Honesty I feel like I have a lot to do and my focus is needed hearing other students winning credit cards makes me want to be more seriously and after hearing other students sharing their journey to study India and their success in projects with the help of their mentors ,I feel like one day it will be me sharing the same story and most of them they were saying "I just want to extend my sincere gratitude to my mentor Mr Ritvik " in my mind I was just saying next time it will be me in the spote ,it was an amazing event I get to know that know hard work goes unnoticed
29/05/23, 13:38 - Tenzin: I am glad to hear that.
