I am a proud Edoofian
13/07/22, 20:33 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

15/07/22, 00:44 - Margret EWYL22E0176: I was inspired by his zeal to learn and improve his skills from his father's business
15/07/22, 00:46 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes Margret!
15/07/22, 00:46 - Aditi Kapoor: Amazing work on the Lesson task. I saw that Patrice had the wisdom to recognize and grab the opportunities that time brought for him and that is what set him apart from others and made him who he is.

Do you agree on this Margret?
15/07/22, 01:15 - Margret EWYL22E0176: Completely,I agree
15/07/22, 01:16 - Aditi Kapoor: Now recognizing and grabbing the opportunities that come at hand is crucial. Do you believe you do that as well?
15/07/22, 01:17 - Margret EWYL22E0176: I do believe
15/07/22, 01:58 - Aditi Kapoor: So, do you believe you are able to utilize the opportunity that the EWYL program creates for you? Are you able to fully leverage your opportunity to self fund your higher education?
15/07/22, 02:13 - Margret EWYL22E0176: Yes sir I really believe so
15/07/22, 03:11 - Aditi Kapoor: So Margret, this is time to make significant progress on the community building project and other EWYL projects to bring in schools and talk to company managers.

18/07/22, 07:56 - Margret EWYL22E0176: *Saturday Activity*
Day by day things change , some businesses grow,some are shattered but others bring joy to the owner.I would like to talk about the business or sector I see as fast growing in my my country.
Although we have many growing sectors like bookkeeping, computer business ,event planning to mention but a few,I see agriculture  as the fast growing business.
Zimbabwe's commercial farming sector is traditionally a source of exports and foreign exchange. Additionally ,the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi -Arid Tropics(ICRISAT) assists Zimbabwe's farmers to adopt conservation agriculture techniques.
Furthermore,the institute helps in increasing yield through a sustainable method of farming.
There are different types of agriculture which are:
Agronomy
Horticulture
Forestry
Animal Husbandry
Fishery science
Agricultural Engineering
Home Science.
These are the categories which agriculture can be grouped into. I believe that Agriculture is the fast growing sector because if done on a large scale it really pays off.
18/07/22, 20:37 - Margret EWYL22E0176: Good morning I am a proud Edoofian.
18/07/22, 20:38 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride.

18/07/22, 23:58 - Aditi Kapoor: I see margret. Which projects?
19/07/22, 00:01 - Margret EWYL22E0176: The Isaac projects sir
19/07/22, 00:02 - Aditi Kapoor: I see margret.
19/07/22, 00:02 - Aditi Kapoor: I understand this, however, make sure you are now working on the same and submit it. learning theory is also as crucial.
19/07/22, 02:54 - Margret EWYL22E0176: Ok sir
19/07/22, 20:45 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello Margret, how are you doing?
19/07/22, 20:46 - Aditi Kapoor: Let me first help you understand what SWOT Analysis is.

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment.This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organisations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
19/07/22, 21:27 - Margret EWYL22E0176: I understand sir.
19/07/22, 21:52 - Aditi Kapoor: Also Margert, As seen above, SWOT is an acronym of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. However, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym:

1 Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
2 Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
3 Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
4 Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by
19/07/22, 22:48 - Margret EWYL22E0176: I really wanted to know about that
19/07/22, 23:17 - Aditi Kapoor: Amazing Margret. You know why SWOT Analysis is important? It can help you to challenge risky assumptions and to uncover dangerous blindspots about your organization's performance. If you use it carefully and collaboratively, it can deliver new insights on where your business currently is, and help you to develop exactly the right strategy for any situation.
19/07/22, 23:17 - Aditi Kapoor: For example, you may be well aware of some of your organization's strengths, but until you record them alongside weaknesses and threats you might not realize how unreliable those strengths actually are.

Equally, you likely have reasonable concerns about some of your business weaknesses but, by going through the analysis systematically, you could find an opportunity, previously overlooked, that could more than compensate.
20/07/22, 00:38 - Margret EWYL22E0176: I understand now
20/07/22, 02:30 - Aditi Kapoor: Also Margret, here are some of the mistakes i believe people make with SWOT Analysis:
1 Making your lists too long. Ask yourself if your ideas are feasible as you go along.
2 Being vague. Be specific to provide more focus for later discussions.
3. Not seeing weaknesses. Be sure to ask customers and colleagues what they experience in real life.
4. Not thinking ahead. It's easy to come up with nice ideas without taking them through to their logical conclusion. Always consider their practical impact.
5 Being unrealistic. Don't plan in detail for opportunities that don't exist yet.
20/07/22, 03:10 - Margret EWYL22E0176: I hear you Sir
20/07/22, 03:10 - Margret EWYL22E0176: I hear you Sir
