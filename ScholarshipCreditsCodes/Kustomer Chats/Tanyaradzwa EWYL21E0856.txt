14/07/22, 01:39 - Saloni Rastogi: Sure Tanyaradzwa.
14/07/22, 01:40 - Saloni Rastogi: Here we have a dose of *Wednesday wisdom* on our most loved topic of Entrepreneurship. Yes, today’s lesson is going to talk about a sincere and passionate young female entrepreneur who has made her mark on the African Startup ecosystem. She is an award-winning UI\/UX Designer with seven years of experience working in the technology environment. We are talking about Oluwadamilola Soyombo, the founder of Skooqs. Today’s lesson will take us through the incident when Skooqs was born. I am sure a very valuable lesson is there for all of us to learn from. \u2028\u2028Also, I would like to highlight that Skooqs has partnered with Edoofa and will be working closely on providing our students with projects to work on and gain experience.  The first batch is already assigned the project. \u2028\u2028Go through the audio and pdf carefully and let me know if you have any concerns,
14/07/22, 01:41 - Saloni Rastogi: This is the Wednesday lesson.
14/07/22, 01:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Now I am sharing the weekend activity.
*weekend activity*
14/07/22, 01:42 - Saloni Rastogi: You must have learned how critical it is to take advantage of every opportunity. In our Wednesday Wisdom this week, we discussed a profitable business- Skooqs. Do you know that Skooqs was developed in just five days!! Thanks to Oluwadamilola Soyombo's (Founder of Skooqs), diligence and use of the opportunity. The use of the opportunity at the right time with the right skills is currently creating a significant impact on the African entrepreneurial ecosystem.  And well some of you, because of your consistency, diligence, willingness to show up for your sessions, and performance in your weekly activities have gotten this opportunity to work on a project with Skooqs. 

You are probably aware of the possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. This week, I want you to think of a few skills or practices that a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits. 
Please list the skills that are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring in a lot of learning.
14/07/22, 01:42 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know by when will you be able to complete this?
14/07/22, 01:45 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL21E0856: By Friday sir , I will be done
14/07/22, 01:55 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you complete the Wednesday lesson by tomorrow afternoon 12 PM and the weekend activity by 06:00 PM tomorrow?
14/07/22, 19:33 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL21E0856: About Oluwadamilola Soyombo and Skooqs , I learned that effort is the key to success. She graduated from university and earlier , she invested into business. Thus means our main issue of aquiring information and get educated , we have to apply it in real life and solve problems which are being faced by people , either nationally or community problems. 

This story reminds me some motivational says from Elon Musk . He said that as a human being , be a critical thinker and a problem solver. So that's the same thing with Oluwadamilola Soyombo's story , it taught me to be a problem solver and making effort on everything I do .
14/07/22, 19:34 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL21E0856: I am a proud Edoofian
14/07/22, 19:34 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL21E0856: Good morning sir
14/07/22, 19:36 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

15/07/22, 01:52 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL21E0856: *The skills that are required for someone to get projects that are challenging and will bring in a lot of learning.*

Effort - Doing everything with effort is the best key , especially for some projects which are challenging . Someone have to   do these projects impactly , follow instructions and build self confidence. 

Hardworking - Working hard on projects is the best. This lead to successfulness and earnig high scholarship credits .Doing things which cause fatigue it so challenging but what it  needs is hardworking . 

Time management : Someone needs to be time consciousness inorder to reduce pressure for him or her to be successful on everything he or she do , especially when doing challenging projects which leads to learning.

Seeking for some ideas: For someone to overcome some projects which are challenging  , he or she have to seek for some ideas and utilise the on reality. Trying is better than doing nothing at all. Someone have to try using some useful ideas he or she had been told.
15/07/22, 03:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Tanyaradzwa!
15/07/22, 03:18 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your Wednesday wisdom response and I must say that your opinions and views reflect clarity of idea. Not just this, your simplified understanding of our  young African entrepreneur,
*Oluwadamilola Soyombo* assures me that you have that zeal and passion to turn your dreams and ambitions into a _big successful reality_. 
The main idea behind this is to you realize that where there is a DESIRE to work hard, there is always a PATH that can take you to favorable outcomes. I know you are putting in all your efforts and I very well appreciate them, but I know you are capable to do much more than this, it is just about taking one more step ahead of others that will make you outshine in this crowd of millions of people.
This project also highlighted Edoofa's Training and Development partner Skooqs.
15/07/22, 03:20 - Saloni Rastogi: As to your weekend activity, I am really glad to hear your understanding of the activity. Your views reflect how deeply you have thought about the activity, analyzed the importance of projects, and then penned down your views. Also, I am so happy to receive a timely response from you *my proud edoofians*.
The main idea behind the activity was to realize how important these projects are.
Projects are a very crucial and irreplaceable part of this *EWYL JOURNEY* . They help us learn a bundle of skills such as  building, confidence boost, social media management, leadership orientation and so much more. These skills might sound very normal but when the time comes to actually apply them, very few kids are able to stand up and confidently come up. Along with upliftment, these skills also help us gain *SCHOLARSHIP CREDITS* that will help us reduce our fees, I know every student wants that. 
The project was a big shout-out to our ongoing PROJECT SKOOQS.
I want to say this only to you that I really want you to outshine other kids and be known in this crowd for your hard work, passion, and dedication to these projects. This activity was to make you understand which skills are important to grab these projects and how they can help us.
15/07/22, 03:22 - Saloni Rastogi: I have sent you this week's Wednesday lesson, hoping for a timely response.
15/07/22, 06:07 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL21E0856: Understood

How are you doing?
15/07/22, 20:26 - Saloni Rastogi: I am so glad to see your excitement and enthusiasm toward our daily ritual.
15/07/22, 20:26 - Saloni Rastogi: From his dad’s small foray into entrepreneurship, Patrice Motsepe got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe’s success story is a remarkable one showing how curiosity, doggedness, perseverance, and the knack to exploit great opportunities as they come, can determine how successful or not, any individual could become. 
And this was all about our WEDNESDAY WISDOM.
Hope you have gone through it.
I am so excited to listen to your thoughts and views HERE.
16/07/22, 01:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Please share your response to lesson Tanyaradzwa.
16/07/22, 02:46 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL21E0856: *That  better  managed  their  finances  and  operations. The  Establishment  of  The  African  Rainbow  Minerals  (ARM). After  saving  up  for  many  years,  in  1997  when  the  price  of  Gold  was  falling,  one  of  the  largest  mining  companies  in South  Africa,  AngloGold,  was  looking  to  sell  some  of  their  smaller,  older,  low-performing  mine  shafts,  so  they  could focus  on  their  larger  and  higher  performing  mines. With  this  golden  opportunity  staring  him  in  the  face,  Patrice  Motsepe  promptly  founded  the  African  Rainbow Minerals  (ARM)  and  proceeded  to  acquire  one  of  the  mine  shafts  that  were  up  for  sale  by  AngloGold. With  a  price  tag  set  at  $8.2  million,  Patrice  Motsepe  had  to  run  around  in  a  bid  to  source  the  money  before  the opportunity  was  gone.  He  ran  to  the  banks,  but  they  refused  him  a  loan  because  the  mine  was  up  for  sale  for  being unprofitable,  and  besides,  no  black  South  African  had  ever  owned  a  mining  operation  before.Now  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Anglo’s  gold  and  uranium  division  at  the  time,  Bobby  Godsell,  decided  to  help Patrice  Motsepe  out,  since  he  knew  about  his  previous  mining  contract  services  and  had  also  observed  his  zeal  to want  to  venture  into  the  mining  business. They  struck  a  good  deal,  and  Bobby  Godsell  handed  over  the  mining  shafts  to  Patrice  Motsepe,  who  would  pay  the $8.2  million  cost  over  a  period  of  years. With  the  price  of  Gold  still  falling,  Patrice  Motsepe  had  to  take  drastic  steps  to  ensure  the  mine  had  a  full turnaround.  To  do  this,  he  implemented  a  lot  of  lean  operations,  downsized  the  staff  at  the  Orkney  mine  to  5,000 from  7,500,  cut  the  management  staff  in  half,  and  worked  from  a  building  located  in  Orkney,  so  he  could  supervise its  operations  directly  since  it  w
16/07/22, 02:52 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL21E0856: This part inspred me , becuase it is highlighting that Patrice  Motsepe  became successful due to patience and being wiser enough. It taught me a lesson of being a wise man with best mindset. Though there are some obstacles and challenges he faced but what he was striving for was very important that is why he never give up . A big lesson I learned about the story of Patrice  Motsepe is effort , passion , patience and never giving up on something which is so challenging and it leads to successfulness.
16/07/22, 05:09 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your response Tanyaradzwa and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a WAY. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. We can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.
16/07/22, 14:55 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL21E0856: Truely speaking, I will try not to never give up on everything I do no matter how hard or tough it is . Also I need to build patience and  confidence on my own

How's your day going?
22/07/22, 23:18 - Saloni Rastogi: Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our *WEDNESDAY Wisdom* was all about and we will discuss the same on the EWYL Line only.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
3. pending response to the weekend activity

23/07/22, 21:16 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL21E0856: My understanding on the Wednesday activity:

For someone to be successful in life , he or she must not have to blame anyone else. But they have to learn from their mistakes and move forward in order to achive a common goal.  Lazeness on doing something is a loss they are building in their path way of life . Effort is only one must have to do to be a successful professional.
23/07/22, 23:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day Tanyaradzwa!
How's your day going?
24/07/22, 00:02 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your response to the weekend activity and I must say that I am very impressed.
The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.
24/07/22, 00:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Along with this, I read your response to the Wednesday wisdom and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like, not what others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
24/07/22, 00:04 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL21E0856: My day is going well ma'am, hope you are well too.

25/07/22, 03:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

27/07/22, 01:06 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL21E0856: My understanding:
A growth mindset of  successful people , is that one which is well informed. Always forcused on how to become a successful professional. Someone with a good mindset makes effort on everything he or she do inorder to succeed. Referring to the Wednesday activity, for someone to be successful in life , he or she must nit blame anyone else. But even if they face some challenges , they raise and move forward and also learn from their mistakes. 

Above all I wish to be a successful professional , then I have to follow instructions , effort , passion and patience. I have to make sure on everything I do , thereby avoiding mistakes. I also need to make my mindset grow by learning from my mistake , put effort on everything I do. I also need to have a good behavior or attitude. I also need to be friendly  to everyone.
27/07/22, 05:34 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me share some more pictures, these smiling faces mean the world to us Tanyaradzwa.
27/07/22, 05:35 - Saloni Rastogi: I read your understanding of the activity and I can just say that it reflects determination, dedication, and passion to move ahead in life and do wonders. 
All I can say is that where you see people succeeding in ways you want to emulate in your own life, know that it’s not by accident or luck that they got there. The truth is they learned how to think in ways that brought them that success.
Whether you’re looking to experience better results and\/or quality of life in your career, business, or any other area of your life, you can. You simply need to examine where you feel your mindset might lack clarity, structure, and direction. 
According to me, there are a few traits and qualities that all successful people should hold:

- Peak Performance, not Perfectionism
- Accountability
- Goal-Oriented with a Grounded Emotional Compass
- Entrepreneurial
- Emotionally Intelligent

Final Thoughts
One thing that connects all the above points is that successful people don’t do the normal or expected thing. And like I have said, ''Whether it’s one or all of these mindsets you identify as your missing links between where you are and where you want to be, the great news is now you know your benchmarks from which to spring forward.''.

28/07/22, 22:30 - Saloni Rastogi: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

Time management is defined as using your time productively and efficiently—but what about when you are working as productively as possible, and you still can’t get everything done? It may be better to think about time management as a combination of working productively and prioritizing your time.

Our *Wednesday Wisdom* was all about Time Management and understanding the priority matrix to organize our tasks. 
I am really excited to hear your understanding and working on the same.
Please share it with me here.
In today's session we will talk about:
1. your understanding of the Wednesday Wisdom
2. progress on community building projects.
29/07/22, 18:23 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL21E0856: I will tell you ma'am , if I need something.
