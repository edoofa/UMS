27/07/22, 23:51 - Panashe EWYL22E0468: Hello, it's Panashe Guze.
28/07/22, 16:54 - Jasmine Kaur: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 

Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times pere week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these att

28/07/22, 23:07 - Panashe EWYL22E0468: I am a proud Edofian.
28/07/22, 23:53 - Jasmine Kaur: Greetings my proud edoofian,
I hope you are rising and shining!
28/07/22, 23:53 - Jasmine Kaur: Today I wanted to discuss the recent message I shared with you. The message that we want to be our daily habit, our words of connecting and experiencing a sense of belonging, We all at team Edoofa are very thrilled as we personally are undertaking the same activity. May I know what have you understood from this message, what is the intention behind the same?
29/07/22, 00:07 - Panashe EWYL22E0468: A link that connects us all. A sense of belonging and shared love between Edoofa students.
Edoofians are goal oriented? hard workes, focused and aiming to use their skills to help countries. 
The exercise is for building confidence and having pride for being an Edoofian
29/07/22, 15:50 - Panashe EWYL22E0468: I am a proud Edoofian.
29/07/22, 15:52 - Jasmine Kaur: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

31/07/22, 06:27 - Jasmine Kaur: Sat Activity: 

Hello my Proud Edoofians, hope you are doing well. 

A well-constructed timetable establishes a natural rhythm and routine, which can be comforting students as well as their mentors. Having a plan as a learner is very important as it helps you maximize and prioritize on the things that are of urgency or importance. Most students do not have an organized study plan and if they do, they fail to follow the plan drawn. As the Wednesday Wisdom offered advice on how to use our time wisely. You must share your daily schedules with your mentors as part of your Saturday activity in the format that has been provided. You can check the image of a timetable and draw it on paper and show it to your mentors. Do not forget to provide the scheduled time for your EWYL programme.
Deadline  11 AM

Happy learning and growing.
