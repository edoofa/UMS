10/06/23, 14:11 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.

Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?

This week’s Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel better—together. It’s why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something bigger—as successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.

As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.

Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.
Till then Happy Learning!
12/06/23, 01:12 - Moline EWYL22E0664: I'm going to sacrifice my comfort thus living my country,my family and everything that I'm familiar with to go study in India where I'm going to meet people with the same goals as mine, I'm going to put my strength in these studies and image victorious at the end. Some wise man say hard work pays of hence I'm motivating my friends that they should support me in this decision I've decided to follow because if you want to be successful you should learn how to compromise in life that's things work out.Since I'll be in the edoofa program I will be meeting new people hence I'm going to look for people who are ambitious and supportive to help mold me up in help of edoofa.Personally I'm sure when you thrive and work hard in the community eventually you will find people who will be inspired by your work and would like to work with you especially when you do unique things,that's how I'm going build a stronger and better student community
