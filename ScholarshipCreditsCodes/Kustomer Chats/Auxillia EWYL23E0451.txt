19/10/23, 15:50 - Aditi Kapoor: Good day to you!
Hope you are well.
19/10/23, 15:51 - Aditi Kapoor: That's great!
19/10/23, 15:51 - Auxillia EWYL23E0451: I'm good and you ma'am .
19/10/23, 15:52 - Aditi Kapoor: I am well.
Thanks for asking.
19/10/23, 15:52 - Auxillia EWYL23E0451: Great
19/10/23, 15:52 - Aditi Kapoor: So let's start with your project's discussion.
19/10/23, 15:52 - Auxillia EWYL23E0451: Yes ma'am .
19/10/23, 15:53 - Aditi Kapoor: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
19/10/23, 15:53 - Aditi Kapoor: ..
19/10/23, 15:59 - Aditi Kapoor: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
19/10/23, 16:32 - Auxillia EWYL23E0451: So in this audio an Edoofian is someone who has a great sense of community building . In this way, an inclusive and supportive society is created, as well as working towards a single goal, therefore collective success .This community building project promotes an equal education system between Indians and those in Africa .In this process , it involves networking education which is social media education that allows students to identify opportunities for their 21st careers . So in this project we are required to reach to undergraduate student (using networking) Guidance is provided by our mentors on how to accomplish the task .



Sorry for late response ma'am  .
19/10/23, 16:33 - Aditi Kapoor: May I know the reason for late response Auxillia?
19/10/23, 16:33 - Aditi Kapoor: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

19/10/23, 16:34 - Auxillia EWYL23E0451: I was struggling to understand the audio ma'am . Off which my phone had switched my writing to another language twice .
19/10/23, 16:34 - Aditi Kapoor: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
19/10/23, 16:35 - Aditi Kapoor: I understand the issue, Auxillia.
19/10/23, 16:38 - Auxillia EWYL23E0451: I'm following ma'am.
19/10/23, 16:39 - Aditi Kapoor: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
19/10/23, 16:40 - Auxillia EWYL23E0451: Alright maam
19/10/23, 16:40 - Aditi Kapoor: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*

For eg: In your case, it will be-

*AUXILLIA/ADITI/19OCT23*
19/10/23, 16:40 - Auxillia EWYL23E0451: Alright ma'am .I will follow .
19/10/23, 16:43 - Aditi Kapoor: 
19/10/23, 16:43 - Auxillia EWYL23E0451: So can I do start to do that now .
19/10/23, 16:46 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, sure!
19/10/23, 16:47 - Aditi Kapoor: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
19/10/23, 16:47 - Aditi Kapoor: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
19/10/23, 16:47 - Aditi Kapoor: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
19/10/23, 16:51 - Auxillia EWYL23E0451: Im following ma'am .
19/10/23, 16:52 - Aditi Kapoor: Great!

19/10/23, 16:53 - Auxillia EWYL23E0451: Alright ma'am
19/10/23, 16:53 - Aditi Kapoor: ...
19/10/23, 16:54 - Auxillia EWYL23E0451: Alright ma'am
19/10/23, 16:55 - Aditi Kapoor: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,

1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
19/10/23, 16:56 - Aditi Kapoor: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.
19/10/23, 16:56 - Auxillia EWYL23E0451: Yes ma'am .
19/10/23, 16:56 - Aditi Kapoor: I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
19/10/23, 16:56 - Aditi Kapoor: ....
19/10/23, 17:00 - Auxillia EWYL23E0451: Alright ma'am .
19/10/23, 17:01 - Aditi Kapoor: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:


Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
19/10/23, 17:01 - Aditi Kapoor: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
19/10/23, 17:01 - Aditi Kapoor: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
19/10/23, 17:05 - Aditi Kapoor: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.
19/10/23, 17:05 - Auxillia EWYL23E0451: Alright ma'am . So now I can start doing the above task right ?
19/10/23, 17:53 - Aditi Kapoor: Yes, you may!
19/10/23, 18:04 - Auxillia EWYL23E0451: Ma'am sorry for disturbing , after one has signed the form , should I send it here on the line or the group I have just created or the other group we've been chatting in.
20/10/23, 12:56 - Auxillia EWYL23E0451: Good morning ma'am .I am a proud EDOOFIAN .
20/10/23, 12:56 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my dear Proud Edoofian !!
