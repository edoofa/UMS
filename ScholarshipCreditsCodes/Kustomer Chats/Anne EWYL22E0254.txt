Let us start our day with this beautiful quote  got to get up every morning with determination if you’re going to go to bed with satisfaction.” – George Lorimer
19/07/22, 00:01 - Anne EWYL22E0254: Agricultural sector is one of the most fast growing in Zimbabwe . Its contributes about 18% of Zimabwe's GDP. It caters  for more than 60 - 70 employees and providing income for 60-70% of the population. The agricultural sector in Zimbabwe involves 
1. Hotculture
2.crops such as maize and millet
3.fisheries
5. Forestry 
6.livestock 
Agriculture has had an impact on both social and economic aspects of peoples lives in Zimbabwe. It boots the country ' economy as it provides meet , raw sugar and tobacco for export just to mention a few through this the country attains foreign currency which it uses for the global market.Agriculture is also essential for agro tourism, job creation , source of raw materials for other industries , entrepreneurship and investment  opportunities, economic diversity and food security. But on the other hand agriculture has its drawbacks like all forms of pollution ie pesticides , fertlisers ,and other chemicals can poison water bodies bringing harm to marine ecosystem, humans , air and soil. If scale production increases they is a  risk of production of poor quality food . Agricultural sector especially on the crop production sector is unpredictable since they are climate changes all around .For livestock production, new strains of drug resitent diseases may bring harm to livestock and reduce productivity. In the next 4 or 5 or even 30 or more years the agricultural sector in zimabwe will continue to strengthen and grow . And if the negative implications of agriculture are controlled or monitored it is sure to expand and grow . Overally agriculture is the back bone of Zimbabwe's ecomony and underpins the economical , social and political running of the nation at large .New technological advancement and new discoveries will help the sector to continue grow and become more fruitfull.

Hello my Proud Edoofians, hope you are doing well. 

A well-constructed timetable establishes a natural rhythm and routine, which can be comforting students as well as their mentors. Having a plan as a learner is very important as it helps you maximize and prioritize on the things that are of urgency or importance. Most students do not have an organized study plan and if they do, they fail to follow the plan drawn. As the Wednesday Wisdom offered advice on how to use our time wisely. You must share your daily schedules with your mentors as part of your Saturday activity in the format that has been provided. You can check the image of a timetable and draw it on paper and show it to your mentors. Do not forget to provide the scheduled time for your EWYL programme.
Deadline  11 AM

Happy learning and growing.
