Will Artificial Intelligence revolutionize our world or render us obsolete?

 As we witness the remarkable progress in AI, we ponder its potential to transform our lives and simultaneously question if it will replace us
15/11/23, 16:58 - Ananya: Happy Wednesday! üåü
Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

17/11/23, 13:19 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0652: okay, understand
17/11/23, 13:24 - Ananya: So, Tanyaradzwa have you had a chance to read your wednesday lesson about facing challenges and uncertainties, especially the part about Alex turning adversity into triumph? I'd love to hear your thoughts on how his story resonates with the idea of viewing challenges as stepping stones for growth rather than roadblocks.
17/11/23, 13:30 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0652: It was indeed interesting,it was actually to talking about what us African kids usually face,the liking to study but lack of financial support
17/11/23, 13:31 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0652: so Alex faced his challenges and figured out a way to overcome them by attaining scholarships and all
17/11/23, 13:35 - Ananya: I completely agree; it's truly fascinating. The discussion about the challenges faced by African students, such as the strong desire to study but the lack of financial support, is unfortunately quite common. Alex's journey in overcoming these challenges by attaining scholarships is both inspiring and relatable.
17/11/23, 13:36 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0652: yes l agree
17/11/23, 13:39 - Ananya: Now, Tanyaradzwa as we were discussing in our previous session, were you able to find the contact information of other school heads?

17/11/23, 13:50 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0652: and Corpus Christ High
17/11/23, 14:03 - Ananya: Great, now tell me if you have shared your first message with them.
17/11/23, 16:35 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0652: l am sending it right away
18/11/23, 16:16 - Ananya: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one ‚Äì it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!

Don't miss out on discovering the life-changing opportunities edoofa can offer, Opening doors to a world of possibilities!
20/11/23, 17:45 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0652: So it was in 2021 when l had finished writing my A level and was waiting for my results,not sure whether l passed or not.So my dream ever since l was a kid was to make it in life,tue most thing l am scared of is failing in life because if l do so l have not only failed as an individual but that failure also affects other people in my chain which includes my family,my future family,friends and all of those people that may be dependent on me.

So when the results came out l was not very happy with them since they couldn't qualify me to do any course of my interest which outraged one other thing l never like where my parents came in to decide for me now to do things that were not of my interest,they all wanted me to persue engineering courses  and every single day l prayed to God to perve my way to lead me to the things of my interest.

2022 ended and l had given up on going to University and just do as they all want because the issue now was out of hand and age along side was catching up with me having no career for a man is defined by what he knows best,l had decided to just go along with what they wanted,l had given up on all my prayers but this year in 2023 just chilling around with my friends discussing such issues one of the guys told me about Edoofa and he even said he is going the same year .l went home looked Edoofa on the Google and every social platform just to confirm before l applied and its a testimony since my journey so far with Edoofa is going smoothly and well enough that l am even  going to India for my University and in the same field that l've always wanted(enterprenuership)
