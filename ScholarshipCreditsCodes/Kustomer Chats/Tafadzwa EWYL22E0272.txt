25/07/22, 03:17 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

11/08/22, 22:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
15/08/22, 21:33 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello our Proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well.

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off 



We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

May I know how are you planning to work on it?

27/12/22, 18:34 - Saloni Rastogi: Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.
27/12/22, 18:35 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0272: Noted mam,. I said it mam
27/12/22, 18:52 - Saloni Rastogi: You said you are interested in Community Building. Now, I would want that plan something on how to work on it.
D you have something in your mind?
27/12/22, 18:58 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0272: Ok mam, since the project is about identitying friends who are willing to apply for edoofa and to go an extra mile with edoofa. I was thinking of sharing my exposure to them on how edoofa is helping me and enlightening them about edoofa by creating a group in which l am going to share the above mentioned information.
27/12/22, 19:35 - Saloni Rastogi: Some of my students have formed a WhatsApp group where they:
First, keep sharing the link of the group in their family groups, class groups, and school groups, with the children who stay nearby, and, try to circulate all around.
Second, once new people get added to the group, they are told about Edoofa and it the perks of being associated with it.
Third, they share the community building form with them, and then the children fill out the form and share it with the group.

What do you think about this?
27/12/22, 19:39 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0272: That's a brilliant idea
27/12/22, 19:41 - Saloni Rastogi: You can start working on it by today and share with me the content that you will be telling everyone in the group.

27/12/22, 22:23 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0272: Ok mam
27/12/22, 22:24 - Saloni Rastogi: I said this because Community Building is a project for you, not for others. We need to tell them about Edoofa here, so we must start by putting the right impact by stating the right name.
27/12/22, 22:25 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0272: Ok l understand mam
27/12/22, 22:29 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0272: Mam am not understanding. The content that l am going to prepare must consist of what mam.

1) what is Edoofa
2) the process 
3) how study in India can be achievable
4) concept of scholarships
27/12/22, 22:37 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0272: Ok l understand mam

03/03/23, 21:39 - Saloni Rastogi: I completely agree with you on Wednesday lesson and I believe experiences make us feel alive: there are times when we live our lives and slowly let them pass us by. This can happen when you stick to the same routine day and night without doing anything new. Going through life in the same 'state' can be tedious, but an unforgettable experience will awaken your mind and soul.
