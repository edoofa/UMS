18/07/22, 20:43 - Sisasenkosi EWYL21E0425: I had a great weekend thanks.Hope you had a great one too
18/07/22, 21:57 - Unknown: I did Sisasenkosi.
18/07/22, 21:57 - Unknown: Let me now help you understand what SWOT Analysis is.

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique that helps to breakdown the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a certain idea, project or experiment. This technique is used as a tool during the decision-making process of many businesses or organisations to validate project ideas and ascertain whether the project in question is worth pursuing.
19/07/22, 01:37 - Sisasenkosi EWYL21E0425: Okay l get it now
19/07/22, 01:40 - Unknown: As seen above, SWOT is an acronym of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. However, it's important that we specify what is meant by each part of the acronym:

1 Strengths: a resource or capability that will help to achieve desired goals
2 Weaknesses: a barrier that will hinder the chance of achieving desired goals
3 Opportunities: something, usually external, that could provide you with a competitive advantage
4 Threats: potential obstacles that your project\/idea\/business could be affected by
19/07/22, 01:44 - Sisasenkosi EWYL21E0425: Okay lm following...
19/07/22, 02:48 - Unknown: You know why SWOT Analysis is important? It can help you to challenge risky assumptions and to uncover dangerous blindspots about your organization's performance. If you use it carefully and collaboratively, it can deliver new insights on where your business currently is, and help you to develop exactly the right strategy for any situation.
19/07/22, 02:48 - Unknown: For example Sisasenkosi, you may be well aware of some of your organization's strengths, but until you record them alongside weaknesses and threats you might not realize how unreliable those strengths actually are.

Equally, you likely have reasonable concerns about some of your business weaknesses but, by going through the analysis systematically, you could find an opportunity, previously overlooked, that could more than compensate.
19/07/22, 17:49 - Sisasenkosi EWYL21E0425: I am a proud edoofian
19/07/22, 17:50 - Sisasenkosi EWYL21E0425: Okay
19/07/22, 17:51 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

19/07/22, 19:49 - Sisasenkosi EWYL21E0425: Yes i did enjoy
19/07/22, 19:51 - Sisasenkosi EWYL21E0425: The biggest mistakes that people make may be exaggerating or far fetched possible opportunities in the sector that may lead to biased decisions
19/07/22, 20:54 - Unknown: Interesting Sisasenkosi.
19/07/22, 20:54 - Unknown: 1 Making your lists too long. Ask yourself if your ideas are feasible as you go along.
2 Being vague. Be specific to provide more focus for later discussions.
3. Not seeing weaknesses. Be sure to ask customers and colleagues what they experience in real life.
4. Not thinking ahead. It's easy to come up with nice ideas without taking them through to their logical conclusion. Always consider their practical impact.
5 Being unrealistic. Don't plan in detail for opportunities that don't exist yet.

21/07/22, 20:48 - Unknown: Good to read your response on this lesson Sisasenkosi! I am glad that you were able to understand the crux of that which is that successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it
21/07/22, 21:19 - Sisasenkosi EWYL21E0425: Yes sir

22/07/22, 00:50 - Unknown: To be successful, You have to be the owner of your success, you will face many challenges in terms of time management, internet and in regards to efficiency on the projects as well.

11/08/22, 22:09 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"
