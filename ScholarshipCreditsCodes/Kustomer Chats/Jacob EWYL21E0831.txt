19/11/22, 21:55 - Unknown: Good day edoofian ,
Hope everything is well at your end!
I would like to share a brief message about the importance of planning in our lives and as an organization as well!
Planning is definitely significant as it directs us where to go, it furnishes direction and decreases the danger of risk by making predictions. The significant advantages of planning are provided below:
Planning provides directions: Planning assures that the objectives are certainly asserted so that they serve as a model for determining what action should be taken and in which direction. If objects are well established, employees are informed of what the company has to do and what they need do to accomplish those purposes.
Planning decreases the chances of risk: Planning is an activity which permits a manager to look forward and predict changes. By determining in prior the tasks to be completed, planning notes the way to deal with changes and unpredictable effects.
Planning decreases overlapping and wasteful activities: Planning works as the foundation of organising the activities and purposes of distinct branches, departments, and people. It assists in avoiding chaos and confusion. Since planning guarantees precision in understanding and action, work is conducted on easily without delays.

I am apologetic for the delayed response; I was spending quality time with my family!
I asked you to report on 2nd January but, because I was not in town I could not reply in time.
I hope you enjoyed New Year,
I am really excited to know what you did on the NYE!!
I went for a staycation with my family at one of the very beautiful properties in Chandigarh ( a city ).
*Let’s exchange our experience and then we will start with our learnings and curriculum.*
15/01/23, 04:03 - Unknown: The ability to solve problems is a basic life skill and is essential to our day-to-day lives, at home, at school, and at work. We solve problems every day without really thinking about how we solve them. For example: it’s raining and you need to go to the store. What do you do? There are lots of possible solutions. Take your umbrella and walk. If you don't want to get wet, you can drive, or take the bus. There is no right way to solve this problem and different people will solve it differently. However in our Wednesday wisdom we learnt about some Problem solving strategies. As part of your Saturday activity, I want you to share with us a problem that you encountered very recently and how did you Solve It. Did you use any strategy that was similar to what Munger has talked about?

Looking forward to your responses!


We will continue the discussion we left on Monday! 
Do not forget to send *I am a proud edoofian* even on Sunday!!

Do share your results with me on Monday, if they’re out.

17/01/23, 19:57 - Unknown: Hello my lovely edoofians, hope you are doing well.

I have some amazing news and an opportunity to share with you. But first, do you know, A 2018 report by WaterAid India and Menstrual Hygiene Alliance India (MHAI) states that there are 336 million menstruating women in India, out of which only 121 million use sanitary pads. Assuming that these women use eight sanitary pads for one cycle (conservatively), a simple calculation reveals that almost one billion sanitary pads are used and disposed of every year.  The primary component in all disposable sanitary napkins is plastic. This takes approximately 500-800 years to fully disintegrate after disposal. Assuming one billion DSNs are disposed of every year, handling menstrual waste becomes a mammoth task.

And the solution to this problem is Sustainable menstruation!

Wondering what it is :

* Sustainable menstruation refers to the use of alternative products during one’s menstrual cycle for the benefit of the body and the earth.
* Sustainable menstruation is being mindful of the negative effects disposable sanitary products have on our environment in an effort to reduce the plastic waste ending up in our oceans or landfills.

I would like to invite you to our webinar on Sustainable menstruation tomorrow I.e. 18th January 2023, wherein we will be joined by Dr.Aarushi Kehar Malhotra. She will be helping us understand it better and how can each one of us be the solution to this problem.

Don’t forget to join by 5:45 PM IST, the webinar will start exactly at 6:00 PM [2:30 PM: Zimbabwean time] . Don’t be late for this webinar. Come prepared with the questions that you might have!

22/01/23, 04:32 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian, Here is your Saturday task. 
Make sure you submit it on Monday.

Sat activity: 

A college student named Rachel was unsure of what career path to pursue after graduation. She talked to several professionals in different fields, but none of them seemed to fit her interests and skills. One day, she had a conversation with a mentor who asked her the right questions, such as \"What are you passionate about?\" and \"What do you enjoy doing in your free time?\" Rachel realized that her true passion was writing and storytelling. She decided to pursue a career in journalism and landed a job at a top news outlet.

We gained knowledge on how to ask intelligent questions. I'd like you to share with us any two questions you'd like to ask yourself as part of your Saturday submission. The questions that you may have been hesitant to make, the questions that put you in a difficult situation, the inquiries that will have a significant impact on your career and future. For example:  1. What is the limit of my current capabilities and how can I push beyond them to continue learning and growing?\"
2. “How can I ensure that my actions align with my values and contribute to the greater good, rather than just maximizing my own success?\"

Looking forward to your response!
22/01/23, 04:44 - Jacob EWYL21E0831: I will surely submit ma'am
