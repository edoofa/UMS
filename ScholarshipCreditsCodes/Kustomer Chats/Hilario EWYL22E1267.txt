13/03/23, 18:15 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Hilario and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Hilario EWYL22E1267.
14/03/23, 01:26 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Hilario!
How are you?
14/03/23, 01:26 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
14/03/23, 01:26 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY* on the *EWYL Line*.
2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.


If you are ready then we can begin?
14/03/23, 01:26 - Saloni Rastogi: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *11:30 AM-02:30 PM*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
14/03/23, 01:28 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: Understood
14/03/23, 02:34 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know which project will you focus on for the month of March?
14/03/23, 03:24 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: Project 2
14/03/23, 21:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Hilario!
How are you?
14/03/23, 21:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Please follow the daily ritual for today of saying 'I am a proud edoofian',
14/03/23, 21:06 - Saloni Rastogi: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
14/03/23, 21:06 - Saloni Rastogi: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
14/03/23, 21:08 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: I am a proud Edoofian
14/03/23, 21:13 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: B
14/03/23, 21:14 - Saloni Rastogi: Alright, I have noted your answer, the correct answer will be revealed shortly.","transform":"
14/03/23, 21:15 - Saloni Rastogi: The correct answer for today's trivia was option  B","transform":"
14/03/23, 21:15 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: Alright
14/03/23, 21:15 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: Great
14/03/23, 21:17 - Saloni Rastogi: So Hilario, let's discuss about the project.
14/03/23, 21:18 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: Okay
14/03/23, 21:18 - Saloni Rastogi: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
14/03/23, 21:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Out of these three questions, just answer the first question and the third one.
14/03/23, 21:21 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: The name of the school is Balmoral College and i don't know if it's affiliated with the program.
14/03/23, 21:22 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: It's in the Gauteng province
14/03/23, 21:23 - Saloni Rastogi: That's amazing Hilario!
14/03/23, 21:24 - Saloni Rastogi: The information that you have shared can be very useful but let's move ahead.
14/03/23, 21:24 - Saloni Rastogi: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
14/03/23, 21:25 - Saloni Rastogi: A] Through WhatsApp community groups:


STEP 1: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME\/MENTOR NAME\/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED
For eg: In your case it will be-
Hilario\/Saloni\/14MAR2023
14/03/23, 21:25 - Saloni Rastogi: STEP 2: We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

As for attracting the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 5, and Form 6, or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
14/03/23, 21:25 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official\/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to STUDY IN INDIA with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
14/03/23, 21:26 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

And in a very similar manner, you can repeat the same process with the Form 5 students as well.
14/03/23, 21:31 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: I understand, but one problem.
When i left the school i had wasn't in any group of that magnitude
14/03/23, 21:32 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: As of right now or for this month, the only ppl i can get in contact with are family and some friends
14/03/23, 22:16 - Saloni Rastogi: You can take help of your classmates who can help you get added back in all those groups, I am sure they will help you.
14/03/23, 22:19 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: Most of them have moved on, they are already studying at university right now.
14/03/23, 22:42 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you connect with any your juniors who are still in school, in Form 5?
14/03/23, 23:43 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: No not right now
15/03/23, 04:29 - Saloni Rastogi: We will discuss everything tomorrow only if you follow the daily ritual.
Till then, have a great day :fireworks:

How are you?
Please share your understanding of the Wednesday lesson so that we can soon discuss the PROJECTS.
17/03/23, 22:12 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: We didn't discuss much on Wednesday
17/03/23, 22:14 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: I saw the Edoofa's Wednesday Instagram post that spoke of helping students choose between Diploma and UG
17/03/23, 22:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, I am glad that you saw the post and I personally got some clarity.
17/03/23, 22:52 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: Yes
17/03/23, 22:54 - Saloni Rastogi: I am sure you must have received the Wednesday lesson on the EWYL Line.
If not, let me reshare it with you on the EWYL Group.
17/03/23, 22:58 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: I did
17/03/23, 23:25 - Saloni Rastogi: If you have gone through it, can you share with me what have you understood from it?
18/03/23, 01:47 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: Wealth is defined as having assets that earn while you sleep. This means that the value\r
of your assets continues to grow even when you are not actively working or earning\r
money.

Money, on the other hand, is simply a tool that we use to transfer time and wealth. It is\r
a means of exchange that allows us to trade goods and services with others.

Status, on the other hand, is your place in the social hierarchy. It is often associated\r
with wealth and money.

MONEY is simply a tool that we use to transfer time and wealth,\r
and STATUS is not a measure of true success or happiness, so focus on building WEALTH \r
and creating a life that brings you joy and fulfillment.
18/03/23, 04:30 - Saloni Rastogi: Let's continue tomorrow for the weekend activity and our discussion.​
​You know I learned something new today, that is I need to make full use of all the opportunities offered to us and value them.​
​ I also wish the same for you, that you explore the EWYL Program and its amazing opportunities like the projects and continuous learning.
So, think about it and plan tomorrow accordingly.
Till then, have great day?
18/03/23, 21:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings *my proud edoofian*!

Here's a task for you as part of your Saturday activity. Let's start by reflecting on your personal values and what you truly want to achieve in life. Think beyond just material possessions or external validation and focus on what brings you true happiness and fulfillment.

Next, I'd like you to create either a personal mission statement or a vision board that captures your values, goals, and vision. Your mission statement should be concise and inspiring and serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decision-making. Alternatively, your vision board can include images, words, and symbols that represent your values and long-term goals.

Once you've completed either your personal mission statement or vision board, share it with your mentor and discuss how it can help you stay focused on seeking true wealth and fulfillment in life. Revisit your statement or vision board regularly and make adjustments as needed. This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of what you truly value in life and create a roadmap for achieving your long-term goals.

Good luck, and have fun creating!
18/03/23, 21:04 - Saloni Rastogi: You have concluded the understanding of the lesson so well. Even my learning has been that 'Money is simply a tool that we use to transfer time and wealth, and that status is not a measure of true success or happiness. Instead, focus on building wealth and creating a life that brings you joy and fulfillment.' 
And you know _earning scholarship credits_ is just parallel to creating that joy and fulfillment and aiming higher by seeing how much you have earned and beating all the records.
18/03/23, 21:05 - Saloni Rastogi: We last discussed forming the group for community building and adding the right participants. May I know the progress on that?
18/03/23, 21:57 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: I managed to reach one friend who was interested, but his parents already have a vision for him
18/03/23, 21:58 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: So i asked him to connect me to more people who might be interested

20/03/23, 21:33 - Saloni Rastogi: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”

As informed by the group and on in our previous conversation, I will not be available this week due to a family event. So the response to the Wednesday lesson will be heard in the next week's first session.
For the projects, I have full faith in you that you can do wonders, just believe in yourself and work hard?

27/03/23, 22:07 - Saloni Rastogi: Three Feet From Gold
During the gold rush, a man who had worked in the Colorado mine for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t hit the gold yet and the job was getting boring. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it left off. The new engineer was informed by his engineer that there was gold only three meters from where the first miner stopped digging.

The engineer was right, which means that the first miner was only a meter away from hitting the gold before he stopped.

I am sure you would have enjoyed your read!

How are you?
I am excited to hear about the Wednesday lesson and weekend activity understanding from you.
Along with this, make sure you have the plan to achieve this week's PROJECTS TARGETS.
I have noted the updates that you have shared with me so far on the EWYL Line, great going?
See you tomorrow in our session.
28/03/23, 01:29 - Saloni Rastogi: May I know why did you not follow the daily ritual from 23rd to 26th March?
28/03/23, 01:51 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: Thought you said we will start afresh on Monday, so that's why i continued today
28/03/23, 21:24 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

As informed earlier, I was not available last week from Thursday to Friday and the organization was closed on Saturday and Sunday. So let's focus today's session solely on these three things:

1) Wednesday lesson + Weekend activity understanding
2) Whether you were able to complete last week's Projects targets?
3) What are the challenges you are facing in the projects?

Also, this week will be visiting our _Proud Indian Edoofians_ from Wednesday to Saturday. So, the sessions will not be held at that time. And I will be very happy to share the updates of our visit with you as the days go by?
28/03/23, 21:24 - Saloni Rastogi: But daily ritual is something that needs to be followed DAILY even without my presence.
28/03/23, 21:25 - Hilario EWYL22E1267: I'm a proud edoofian
28/03/23, 21:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Good, I believe now that we can resume with our session
28/03/23, 21:28 - Saloni Rastogi: Alright, I have noted your answer, the correct answer will be revealed shortly.","transform":"
29/03/23, 00:55 - Saloni Rastogi: Please excuse me for the delayed response, I was occupied in an internal meeting with the team with was to be attended as a priority about our visit starting tomorrow till Saturday.
As informed, no sessions will be held during this time and we will begin afresh from next week onwards where I will be sharing some crazy and interesting insights with you.
But this will only be done, we you will NOT MISS these *THREE THINGS*:
1) Timely submission of the Wednesday lesson and weekend activity
2) Daily following the ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', the absence of which can lead to not sharing of weekly lessons and activities with you
3) and most importantly, *PROGRESS ON PROJECTS*

I will be tracking the progress on _Monday_.
I completely know that these two weeks, we might not have dedicated discussions on the projects. So in my absence, I want that you think in-depth about *the project you are doing, revising the targets for the same, and completing it*.
I would really be emotional and happy that in a few months, many of the new edoofians will be joining our Indian family here. And honestly, I will be happier that we start preparing now for the future because growth is not measured in one day. We need to work hard consistently and dedicatedly.

Like I always say ‘1 step daily means 1 step UP. 0 step daily means 1 step DOWN’.
I trust you, just believe in yourself.
29/03/23, 01:07 - Saloni Rastogi: The correct answer is A. Zambezi
