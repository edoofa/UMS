25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

11/08/22, 22:08 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

India is celebrating its 76th Independence Day today. And everyone at Team Edoofa is celebrating this day and has taken the day off

Saturday Activity

Greetings My Dear Proud Edoofian!

\"Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.\" ~ Bruce Lee

In this week's Wednesday lesson, you learned about the different sorts of personalities a person carries, but only a true leader is one who understands their personality and can do wonders with its power. In today's activity, I want you to dig deeper into your own consciousness and learn more about the kind of personality you are. As I believe, the more you know yourself, the clearer your vision of the world and your mind gets. Below is a link to a personality test, which you shall be taking up this week, and then would be sharing the results via a screenshot to your mentors by Monday. You can then read and understand more about your results by discussing them with your Mentor.

Link to the Test:  exercise is going to give you an insight into the kind of person you are so that you can use your strengths to yield the maximum benefits in whatever work you take up.

I hope you learn new things and explore new areas of your own personality while performing this activity.

Deadline: Wednesday 9 AM

17/11/22, 17:33 - Unknown: Wednesday Lesson

Hello, my dear proud Edoofian. I hope all is well with you.

Another insightful Wednesday Wisdom is presented here. The lesson today teaches us all how to talk about a less-discussed subject, disability. There is no such thing as normal, as disability serves as a reminder. A person becomes unstoppable if he or she has a strong will and ambition. A few questions near the end of the session will ask you to reflect and have an open dialogue with yourself. After you finish your lesson, as your mentor, I'd like to have a thorough conversation about your key take aways, in our upcoming sessions.

Enjoy the article and keep in mind that success does not come to you suddenly; rather, it can be attained over time by making modest, daily improvements.

Happy learning!

Deadline: Friday 9 AM

17/11/22, 18:03 - Unknown: It is time for our session
17/11/22, 18:03 - Blessing EWYL21E0585: Hello sir
17/11/22, 18:04 - Unknown: Before, We start with our session, I would like you to go through some important information that I am sharing below:

To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages. Let us get a better understanding of the three stages!

Your counselor is your first point of contact. Your counselor has been guiding you during your onboarding process where you learnt about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your Admissions Officer {Miss Vilsha\/Mr. Milan}.I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now you must be aware that all your admissions related queries like: your VISA process, Registration fees, AAL etc. would be addressed\/handled by the Admissions Team. 
Note: Your EWYL mentor\/counselor will not be addressing your admission queries
Finally you will be starting your EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor, where you get a chance to learn 21st century job skills and earn your scholarship credits which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
17/11/22, 18:16 - Unknown: Have you gone through the above message?
17/11/22, 18:17 - Blessing EWYL21E0585: Yes I have gone through it sir
17/11/22, 18:18 - Unknown: Great!
Also, Please share your Project Progress Form.
We have to discuss that in Today's session.
17/11/22, 18:25 - Unknown: Blessing, You do not have to share the form.
Since that discussion is pending
17/11/22, 18:25 - Unknown: Proud Edoofian, This month, I would like to be fully involved in managing the EWYL Projects for you. I will be assigning you the EWYL Project that you will be working on for a particular period.
17/11/22, 18:25 - Unknown: Between Today and Next Wednesday, I would like you to work on the African School Education Reform Mission Project.
The target that we would have to achieve in this project keeping in mind the above dates will be to get 5 forms
Alongside, You can keep working on the Community Building Project and keep sharing the forms or creating a group of 15 or more than 15 students as usual.

Moreover, If you are not confident about the way using which you should communicate with any school head, Feel free to tell me about that. In such case, We can have a dedicated session where I will be telling you about the kind of communication that you should use.
17/11/22, 18:26 - Unknown: Each day along with the Proud Edoofian Ritual, You are expected to share the form that I am sharing below:

Form
Progress Made on each day:
17 Nov
18 Nov
19 Nov
20 Nov

17/11/22, 18:26 - Unknown: If you are not able to submit the above form along with the Proud Edoofian Ritual each day, You will be required to add your parents to your EWYL Group and share the reason in the presence of Ms Deepali, Your Head of Department and your parents.

Now, I would request you to share your understanding of the above message in 2-3 lines here so that I can know if we are on the same page or not.
17/11/22, 18:39 - Blessing EWYL21E0585: I understood that I will have to get atleast 5 forms in a period of a week. I should share the progress form daily and the proud edoofian ritual.
17/11/22, 18:40 - Unknown: Yes, You are right.
The main aim of this practice would be to increase our efficiency in the EWYL projects, which means, increasing our Scholarship credits.

Through the form given above, I would be able to analyze the challenges that you are facing and will be able to train you accordingly.
17/11/22, 18:41 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride.
