I want you to go through these points quickly.
I came across a quote that says taking one step daily leads to progress while taking no steps leads to regression.

It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.

Each month, you should choose one project to work on dedicatedly and make it a learning and earning experience.

10/10/23, 15:57 - Gugulethu EWYL23E0605: Thank you ma’am
10/10/23, 16:09 - Ananya: Gugulethu, in our last session, you mentioned that you received a response from Wanezi School. Could you please provide an update on that?
10/10/23, 16:12 - Gugulethu EWYL23E0605: Oh yes l received a response from Wanezi school but unfortunately l am still waiting for them to submit to fill and submit the form to me so that l can share it with you.
10/10/23, 16:17 - Ananya: You know, Gugulethu, what you can do is ask for the required details from the school head and fill out the form yourself because there's a chance it may have slipped their mind due to their busy schedule.
10/10/23, 16:18 - Gugulethu EWYL23E0605: Wow ma’am that did not cross my mind. Let me do that
10/10/23, 16:25 - Ananya: Absolutely! Today, I have something really important to discuss! This conversation could open up a variety of opportunities for you and your future. I'm sure you don't want to miss out on such an opportunity!
10/10/23, 16:26 - Gugulethu EWYL23E0605: Yes ma’am l wouldn’t want to miss out
10/10/23, 16:33 - Ananya: You know, recently we had a meeting with Angad Sir, and as a whole team, we were planning to introduce some external projects! I'm sharing this information with my students early because these external projects will be considered as valuable experience when they pursue their future dream jobs!
These projects will only be offered to students who have excelled in the EWYL journey and previous projects, as they demonstrate dedication and consistency. So, I think it's essential for us to start preparing as soon as possible. Together, we will brainstorm creative ways to maintain our positive reputation and excellent record. What are your thoughts on this?
10/10/23, 16:38 - Gugulethu EWYL23E0605: This is brilliant ma’am and it’s good that you have informed us this early so that we can be prepared. If l may ask what kind of projects exactly, l mean l am curious ma’am
10/10/23, 16:44 - Ananya: Indeed, last year when students came to India, only well-performing students were offered some amazing projects and had the opportunity to work with renowned brands like Sirona!
Therefore, I want you to be proactive and consistent with your EWYL projects so that you can uphold your reputation in the EWYL department. This way, when an external project comes up, your name will immediately come to mind as a top candidate. Keep up the hard work, and you'll create more opportunities for yourself in the future!
10/10/23, 16:46 - Gugulethu EWYL23E0605: I will definitely do that
10/10/23, 16:52 - Ananya: Now, get ready because our next session is going to be super exciting! We'll dive deeper into this topic and explore some fantastic ideas on how you can maintain unwavering consistency in your projects. It's crucial that we collaborate and devise a new plan of action to achieve our goals together! So, gear up and bring your creativity and enthusiasm to the table because we're going to make amazing progress! Get pumped! 🚀
10/10/23, 16:53 - Gugulethu EWYL23E0605: I can’t wait for our next exciting session

11/10/23, 16:08 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's "Wednesday Wisdom" session will delve into the topic of peak performance and the significance of focus in achieving success. We've all heard experts advise us to concentrate, eliminate distractions, and commit to mastering one thing. This guidance is undoubtedly valuable, and the more I study successful individuals from various fields—be it artists, athletes, entrepreneurs, or scientists—the more I am convinced that focus plays a pivotal role in their accomplishments.

Together, we'll explore strategies and ideas that can help you navigate the complex landscape of choices and find your true calling.
Read the PDF very carefully and we will connect in our upcoming session.

Till Then
Happy Learning!
