I am sure that you must have enjoyed the Webinar last night.
It was a great learning experience for me as well.


Below mentioned are my personal notes from the session yesterday
01/10/22, 17:14 - Unknown: Lack of Industry Ready Youth
-Nowadays, Our Youth has the required degrees but no application of knowledge.
-Yasmin here highlighted the importance of the EWYL Program where edoofians are getting a chance to apply the knowledge through various projects and are also earning side by side.

Importance of Work Experience 
-Carrying forward the point, She explained the importance of work experience. The Earlier you get involved, The better. 

Strive to be a great communicator
-Emphasised being progressive. 
-Highlighted the importance of a united Africa
-The video shared above is one of the best bits from the Webinar

Global Exposure
-Global Exposure is the KEY. The more exposure, The more valuable you become.

Be a Problem Solver
-Employer wants solution-orientated people.
-Every challenge should be seen as an opportunity to innovate, be creative, and develop something.

Be an excellent Time Manager

Embrace Long Life Learning
-Learning never stops. It is a continuous process.
-The more skills you acquire, the more valuable you become
-Youtube: Best University to acquire knowledge for FREE

Commitment
-Show the hunger to learn. Don’t complain, Always be ready to do it.

Be Nice
-What you don’t do in the daylight, Don’t do in the dark
-Believe in Integrity and Trust

Know the Industry, Know the Brand
-Research before you approach

02/10/22, 03:34 - Keith EWYL22E0323: Good evening sir
03/10/22, 01:56 - Keith EWYL22E0323: Shortcuts don't pay for long time
03/10/22, 01:57 - Keith EWYL22E0323: Use the correct route where there will be guidelines on how to move
03/10/22, 16:08 - Unknown: Greetings, Proud Edoofian
I hope that you are doing well
03/10/22, 16:09 - Unknown: Yes, You are right, Keith
03/10/22, 16:09 - Unknown: Today, Due to some urgent meeting, I would not be available between 12-3 PM Indian Time i.e. 8:30 AM to 11:30 AM Zimb Time.

If you have any queries that are urgent, You can give me a call.
Otherwise, We can connect after 3 PM i.e. 11:30 AM Today

In the meanwhile, Please complete the Saturday Activity that was shared with you over the weekend.
If you were unable to receive it, I am again sharing it below this message for your comfort.
03/10/22, 16:09 - Unknown: Hello, my dear Proud Edoofians,

This week we took a step back and reflected upon the objective of the EWYL program. We collectively reflected on why we should be regular with our projects, what these projects will help us earn, and how all of this will result in our individual financial independence.

Today, let's work on the next step which is to plan how to be financially independent by utilizing your time with the right projects. As an activity for this week, I want you to draft a document mentioning:

a)Target- no. of credits you want to earn in the month of October
b)How many projects can you work upon
c)Number of hours that you can devote to your projects
d)Name of the projects that you want to be a part of
e)Plan of action with your mentors

You are required to submit these answers by Today 6 PM. Let me know in case you face any challenges in Submitting the responses.
03/10/22, 18:04 - Keith EWYL22E0323: Greetings Mr Rana,,,,,,, I'm proud Edoofian, doing well thanks
03/10/22, 18:05 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

I hope that you are doing well
07/10/22, 17:19 - Unknown: May I know by when will you be able to submit the Wednesday Lesson that I have shared above?

07/10/22, 21:50 - Keith EWYL22E0323: I understood that, the only way to grow is to reflect on what are you good at and what has to be improved. One has to be prioritisation. Have a vision in life for a bigger picture, creation of a master list of what you need to be done. Find the productive cycle and utilize them. Believe and helping others on their vision.
07/10/22, 21:51 - Keith EWYL22E0323: On the other hand, the plan to connect with the headmaster is a failure if I may say because there is no progress and I think he blocked me. I was was suggesting if we can try another project

Let us start Today’s morning with this motivational quote by Mason Cooley
Procrastination makes easy things hard and hard things harder.

I believe that you would also agree with this, right?
11/10/22, 18:59 - Keith EWYL22E0323: Yes I agree with that so we don't time to waste
11/10/22, 19:38 - Unknown: Yes, Keith
You are right

I hope that you are in good health and spirits
12/10/22, 17:23 - Unknown: Are you sure that he has blocked you, Keith?
Because It might be the case that he is offline
12/10/22, 17:37 - Keith EWYL22E0323: Maybe but it's been a bit long now or I also suspect that he changed his number
12/10/22, 20:51 - Unknown: Keith, Have you tried calling him on this number?
12/10/22, 21:18 - Keith EWYL22E0323: I don't have airtime for international calls
13/10/22, 01:09 - Unknown: No worries, Keith.
Can you reach out to someone in Africa who can reach out to the school head on your behalf?
13/10/22, 02:16 - Keith EWYL22E0323: It might be a little bit tricky but I will try
13/10/22, 18:20 - Unknown: Greetings, Proud Edoofian

Let us start Today’s morning with this motivational quote:
He who asks a question is a fool for five minutes; he who does not ask a question remains a fool forever.
13/10/22, 18:23 - Unknown: I noticed that you have not submitted the Saturday’s Activity yet. The deadline for that was Tuesday 6 PM but I gave you a leeway. Due to the delay, You also missed out on the Wednesday lesson that I was not able to share with you due to the pending last two submissions.

Today, At all costs, I would need the submission for the Last week's Saturday Activity.
I am sharing it below.

After that, I am sharing this week's Wednesday Lesson which you have to submit on Friday by 6 PM.

We can not allow ourselves to at a such mediocre pace.
If somehow, You have not received it, I am sharing it below again. From next time, Please be accountable and reach out to me in case you are unable to receive the tasks because these are meant for your benefit.
13/10/22, 18:23 - Unknown: Hello My Proud Edoofians.

We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". Which briefly means that, even in the circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.

In this week's lesson, you are going to learn more about this same phrase with a real life example. That how a student, who went for his further studies, leaving his home and comfort zone, used all the adversities for his own success and his community's recognition and growth. Because at the end, that is how you take your first flight, not with the wind, but against it.

I hope you enjoy this lesson, and learn as much as possible from it. Because life lessons are always open to new interpretations.

Happy Learning.
13/10/22, 18:26 - Unknown: Now, I am sharing Last week’s Saturday Activity below:

Hello My Proud Edoofians
Happy Weekend! Today's activity is going to be a fun one!
In the coming days, we have planned a fascinating project for you that will help you hone your communication skills,s your confidence, camera presence, and presentation skills. While your mentors will shortly explain what that is, I want you to utilize this weekend to start practicing.
This week's activity is to create a short 30-second video showcasing the topic \"Study In India\"
You can make an Instagram reel, where you can talk about studying in India or use new Instagram trends to express yourselves. The ones who are not familiar with reels can stick to basic 30-sec videos or use any other video creating apps.
We are really intrigued to see your creativity and expression of excitement about studying in India. 
Please feel free to reach out to your mentors in case of any help. We would like you to submit these videos in your next session.

Happy learning!!

13/10/22, 20:22 - Keith EWYL22E0323: From the lesson I understood that even if you are in short of resources it doesn't matter and doesn't determine what will you be in the time come , rather only creativity and eagers to succeed is the only way to do things. I also took note that even if some people look down upon your vision keep yourself determined and make them beleive in you as time move.
13/10/22, 20:31 - Keith EWYL22E0323: From the lesson I understood that for someone to be successful one has to be goal minded and with him or her being goal a guide for goals has to be created which is the a master list .
The list will start with the main objective of the day descending to the least important. In the same way time allocation should be respective to the necessity of the objectives.
