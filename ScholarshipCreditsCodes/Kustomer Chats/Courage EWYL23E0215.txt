19/07/23, 16:02 - Courage EWYL23E0215: How are you today
19/07/23, 16:02 - Courage EWYL23E0215: Thank you
20/07/23, 00:21 - Courage EWYL23E0215: Hie thank you for giving me the chance to share knowledge and understanding from an entrepreneur I admire 

His name is Mr Mbedzi the founder of Doc Miles Photography.He resides in Bulawayo along Tshabalala Road.The story of his life is not an easy one at all,l always thought my background was the worst but no l was mistaken it was actually the best compared to  him.Mr Mbedzi was raised by his mother and he went for his primary level at Newmansford Primary school.The mother was the one who paid  for everything by then.When he reached grade 7 the mother couldn‚Äôt afford his school fees so he dropped his education üíîEveryone felt pity when they saw him and he accepted it as it is.When he was 18 he saw a photographer in town snapping pictures on a beautiful day.He admired the photographer and approached him, told him his story and out of nowhere the photographer took him and spent most of his time with him.Mr Mbedzi spent 4 years with the photographer learning from what he did and he gained experience through that.One day Mr Mbedzi was given an assignment by the photographer to go and snap some of his clients since he was abscent on the day.He went and snapped those pictures and reported back to the photographer.The photographer was amazed that Mr Mbedzi could now snap such beautiful pictures . Then from that the photographer started paying Mr Mbedzi $100 a month.Mr Mbedzi continued and expressed his talent then one day the photographer woke up and it was Mr Mbedzi‚Äôs  birthday, he gifted him with a camera so that he could start his own brand because he was now skilled.

After 10years from there Mr Mbedzi had one of the biggest studios in Bulawayo and currently he owns several drowns there .

Mr Mbedzis background wasnt the easiest but he didnt let his background determine his future , he fought to make a change,he was discouraged but he never gave up, he was punctual and hardworking which made the photographer happy and made him believe in Mr Mbedzi.

Mr Mbedzis story teaches us a lot  like:

1. Never look down upon others.
2.Communication skills made him link up with the photographer which are actual important in ones life.
3Never Give up on your dream

As am speaking right now after Mr Mbedzis success he now sponsers a local orphanage in my community and he offers certain needs and wants to them. He has made a big impact to us and the society and i admire him for that.

His story is trully inspirational and i couldn‚Äôt think of any other person than him.

Thank you

Your Proud Edoofian
