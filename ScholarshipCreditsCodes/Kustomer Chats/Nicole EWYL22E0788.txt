Awareness means to keep ourselves updated about things/events happening around us. These events
can affect us positively or negatively. In terms of our career, it means that we should be well-informed
about various events in the world that will have a bearing on our career and/or career paths. Being
aware helps us navigate our way, adapt and bring changes that will help you still reach the
destination. In today’s context, it simply means to be aware of how businesses are changing and
learning with the times.

20/11/23, 12:58 - Saloni Rastogi: Good morning Nicole,
I trust this message finds you well.

I'm genuinely excited about our upcoming sessions scheduled for Monday from 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM. As we gear up for today's session on the EWYL Line, I've been giving some thought to ways we can enhance our engagement and involve your parents in the process.

After careful consideration, we've decided to shift our sessions to the *EWYL Group starting tomorrow*. This change not only allows us to keep your parents in the loop but also it will also remove the dependency on your following the daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

Starting *tomorrow*, our sessions will be held from *09:00 AM to 10:00 AM, Monday to Friday*, on the *EWYL Group*. This adjustment aims to streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this change to confirm your understanding.

I look forward to our continued collaboration!
20/11/23, 13:02 - Nicole EWYL22E0788: Does this mean I am no longer following the ritual or I still have to do it on the line but the sessions in the EWYL group?
20/11/23, 13:05 - Saloni Rastogi: For now, you don't have to follow the daily ritual. As soon as we are over with our discussion on the projects, then we will resume it by following the daily ritual.
20/11/23, 13:08 - Nicole EWYL22E0788: Noted thank you
20/11/23, 13:09 - Saloni Rastogi: Nicole as I can see you tried to share the thoughts from the document itself and shared with me the key points, that is great but I hope you have understood it.

20/11/23, 13:17 - Nicole EWYL22E0788: Not really
20/11/23, 13:18 - Saloni Rastogi: *Nicole, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Nicole!
20/11/23, 13:18 - Saloni Rastogi: .

20/11/23, 13:37 - Saloni Rastogi: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
20/11/23, 13:37 - Nicole EWYL22E0788: Okay
20/11/23, 13:38 - Nicole EWYL22E0788: This is great thank you
20/11/23, 13:39 - Saloni Rastogi: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
20/11/23, 13:39 - Saloni Rastogi: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-

*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*

For eg: In your case, it will be-

*Nicole/Saloni/20NOV2023*
20/11/23, 13:39 - Saloni Rastogi: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
20/11/23, 13:40 - Saloni Rastogi: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
20/11/23, 13:40 - Saloni Rastogi: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
20/11/23, 13:40 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
20/11/23, 13:42 - Nicole EWYL22E0788: Following thank you
20/11/23, 13:44 - Saloni Rastogi: Once you form the group, do let me know and I will share some information that we can share with the students.
20/11/23, 13:47 - Nicole EWYL22E0788: I formed the group
20/11/23, 13:52 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share the link of your group with me?
20/11/23, 13:53 - Nicole EWYL22E0788: Follow this link to join my WhatsApp group: https://chat.whatsapp.com/BFcDEFxq4KKG4MO2i8H2ra
20/11/23, 13:54 - Saloni Rastogi: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
20/11/23, 13:54 - Saloni Rastogi: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,

1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
20/11/23, 13:54 - Saloni Rastogi: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
20/11/23, 13:54 - Saloni Rastogi: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
20/11/23, 13:55 - Saloni Rastogi: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
20/11/23, 13:56 - Saloni Rastogi: .
20/11/23, 13:58 - Nicole EWYL22E0788: Okay thank you
20/11/23, 13:59 - Nicole EWYL22E0788: Most of the form 5 students I know are still at school can I wait for them?
20/11/23, 14:05 - Saloni Rastogi: You can share it with Form 5 students and as well Form 6students.
20/11/23, 14:11 - Nicole EWYL22E0788: Ohhh okay
20/11/23, 14:15 - Saloni Rastogi: Any other concern that you have in this project?
20/11/23, 14:19 - Nicole EWYL22E0788: No
20/11/23, 14:21 - Saloni Rastogi: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
20/11/23, 14:21 - Saloni Rastogi: .
20/11/23, 14:29 - Saloni Rastogi: Thank you for today's engaging session. I'd like to remind you that tomorrow we're shifting our sessions exclusively to the EWYL Group from 09:00 to 10:00 AM. I'm eager to continue our discussion and pick up from where we left off. Your active participation is key to making our sessions impactful. Looking forward to seeing you there!
20/11/23, 14:29 - Nicole EWYL22E0788: I did not get the name of the project
But I understood that it is about reaching to local schools and inform them about Edoofa program
It is about connecting with the principals and telling them why I joined Edoofa
After everything I am supposed to ask them if they would like to setup a meeting with the director of Edoofa
