10/11/22, 18:56 - Aditi Kapoor: Let us start the chat by saying 'I am a proud Edoofian'
10/11/22, 18:56 - Rejoice EWYL22E0803: I am a proud Edoofian
10/11/22, 18:58 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
