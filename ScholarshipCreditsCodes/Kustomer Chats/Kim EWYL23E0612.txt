16/09/23, 16:31 - Kim EWYL23E0612: Good day
so basically l believe exam preparation is the most important part of an exam period. l actually realised that preparing for an exam is even more difficult than the actual exam, so with this l jotted down ways which made my preparation a bit flexible. The first and most important thing is "time management". One has to know what to do and when to do it. Draft your 24hrs of the day into the subjects that you are preparing towards. Make targets for yourself and ensure that with the time you assigned that target,, you are able to reach it. Share your time equally for reading and resting. Don't put too much pressure on yourself as this will result in your exhaustion and failure to cooperate. Alaywas manage your time wisely.
16/09/23, 17:13 - Unknown: Kim, I'm impressed by how well you understand the question and how clearly, you've explained the ideas. Your quick response is great, and I agree that we need to take certain steps to handle the stress of upcoming exams.
16/09/23, 17:15 - Unknown: Good afternoon Kim!

I hope you're doing well.

Our session on Monday is approaching, and I want to ensure it's productive for you. Here's the flow for our upcoming session:

Saturday Activity Response: Please make sure to have your response to the Saturday activity ready. This will be the first thing we discuss.

But I appreciate you have already submitted that.


Project Updates: I'd like you to provide updates on two fronts:Community Building Project: How many referrals have you received so far, and what progress have you made?

African School Reforms Project: Similarly, please update me on the number of referrals and the status of your work in this project.


Challenges and Roadblocks: We'll then delve into the challenges you're encountering while working on these projects. Be prepared to discuss any obstacles you've faced and any assistance you might need to overcome them.

Remember, the goal of our session is to make sure you're on track, address any issues, and keep making progress.

I hope you are doing well.

May I know why you are late for the session?
18/09/23, 16:59 - Kim EWYL23E0612: good afternoon
l was having a network crisis,, it got fixed just now
18/09/23, 16:59 - Unknown: Okay Kim. Noted.
Make sure you are taking care of all this from next time.
18/09/23, 17:00 - Unknown: Fantastic! Let's make this session a productive one. To begin, I'd like to appreciate your reflective approach to the Saturday activity.
18/09/23, 17:01 - Kim EWYL23E0612: okay
18/09/23, 17:01 - Kim EWYL23E0612: noted
18/09/23, 17:02 - Unknown: Now, let's shift attention to the three projects we've been discussing, particularly the

Community Building and African School Reforms initiatives.
18/09/23, 17:03 - Unknown: Could you provide an  update on the Community Building project? What progress have you made?
18/09/23, 17:05 - Kim EWYL23E0612: For the community building,, l've managed to  talk to two of my friends on WhatsApp of which l'm awaiting their responses.
l'm still yet to talk to my neighbour about it which l'm going to do so today.
18/09/23, 17:06 - Unknown: That is a great thing to start with Kim.
We will discuss few other strategies to reach out a larger pool of audience in our session today.
18/09/23, 17:06 - Unknown: Have you encountered any challenges/difficulties  that require my attention? I'm curious to hear your perspective on the project's current status.
18/09/23, 17:06 - Kim EWYL23E0612: okay
18/09/23, 17:07 - Kim EWYL23E0612: not really
it's just that people really get convinced when the whole thing has happened so some believe they might be scammed,, so l'm trying by all means to show them how real Edoofa is.
18/09/23, 17:11 - Unknown: Kim, this is a challenge which arrives in the very beginning. In such a scenario you should explain to them about your journey with Edoofa and then you can speak about the benefits and assistance that you and other Edoofians get and will be getting throughout their college journey.

You can also give fee comparisons specially when it comes to studying abroad.
18/09/23, 17:12 - Unknown: Along with this I am sharing few videos of our founder with the first lady of Zimbawbe and school heads so that people understand the authenticity of the organization.
18/09/23, 17:14 - Kim EWYL23E0612: okay Ma'am thank you
18/09/23, 17:14 - Kim EWYL23E0612: okay
18/09/23, 17:27 - Unknown: You are welcome.
18/09/23, 17:27 - Unknown: Now, turning our attention to the African School Reforms project. Could you share your insights on the current state of this project?
18/09/23, 17:29 - Kim EWYL23E0612: for this one l haven't been in communication with any schools hey since it was a weekend
by tomorrow morning,l hope to have to spoken specifically to my former  school head and also the nearby schools in my area.
18/09/23, 17:29 - Kim EWYL23E0612: l'm also still trying to gather the contact numbers for the headmasters of different schools
18/09/23, 17:33 - Unknown: Okay Kim, Noted.
18/09/23, 17:34 - Unknown: What milestones have you reached, and do you foresee any potential difficulties that might affect your  progress?
18/09/23, 17:36 - Kim EWYL23E0612: l think l might face a challenge of late responses since headmasters are ever busy people
but for some who are nearer,, if l fail to reach them through the phone,, l might be able to visit them at their schools.
18/09/23, 17:39 - Unknown: That is Indeed a concern Kim. In such a case you can reach out to them sample messages I shared and also through a phone call afterwards.
18/09/23, 17:41 - Kim EWYL23E0612: okay Ma'am
18/09/23, 17:43 - Unknown: Okay Kim. So, before our next session I expect at least 5 school forms from you.
18/09/23, 17:43 - Unknown: Now I want to set a target and I will also send a plan to achieve that target.
18/09/23, 17:44 - Unknown: This is regarding the community building project so are you ready for that?
18/09/23, 17:45 - Kim EWYL23E0612: yeah
18/09/23, 17:48 - Unknown: Goal/Target : Connect with at least 40 students before our next session  and you should be able to submit at least  15 filled Edoofa forms.
18/09/23, 17:48 - Unknown: Plan:
18/09/23, 17:49 - Unknown: 1. Target Identification: Identify specific groups of students who may benefit from Edoofa, such as those interested in higher education abroad or scholarships.

2. Elevator Pitch: Prepare a concise and persuasive pitch about Edoofa, highlighting its benefits, scholarship opportunities, and how it can help them achieve their educational goals.

3. Use Online Platforms: Leverage social media, student forums, and educational groups to connect with potential students. Share Edoofa's mission and the link to the forms.

4. Personal Outreach: Encourage one-on-one conversations with classmates, friends, and acquaintances, explaining how Edoofa can assist them in their educational journey.

18/09/23, 18:01 - Kim EWYL23E0612: yes l'm following
18/09/23, 18:08 - Unknown: Problem-Solving: Engaging with the community often involves addressing questions or concerns. This nurtures your problem-solving skills as you find solutions to potential obstacles.
18/09/23, 18:09 - Unknown: Leadership Development: Taking the initiative to connect and share your organization's mission positions you as a leader within your community. This leadership experience can open doors to new opportunities and responsibilities.

18/09/23, 18:10 - Unknown: Kim don't you think it is always important to know the objective of the goal that we plan to achieve. If we do not know the objectivity or are unconvinced about the target we might not be able to achieve as much as we could have .
