13/07/22, 07:51 - Aditi Kapoor: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

28/07/22, 18:33 - Aditi Kapoor: We are back with our Wednesday lesson.

I realised as soon as I started reading this lesson that most of my students needed to learn and grasp this. One person succeeding and one failing depends solely on how effectively they manage their time. Try to comprehend and apply the measures discussed in the lesson to your everyday life. I'll be here to help you, so that you can focus on learning how to manage your time effectively. In our following session, please explain in detail what you learned from the lesson.Also, do not forget to send *it by 12PM today.*

Happy learning
28/07/22, 19:59 - Marian EWYL21E0803: I learned that you should manage your time properly everyday ,sometimes you need to prune some other things and do things properly.a person must use time wisely to avoid procrastinating about what you want to do and not want to do by that moment

28/07/22, 20:14 - Aditi Kapoor: Many successful people have different approaches that got them to where they are today. But the one thing they have in common is that they know how to juggle high-level projects and make sure they spend the bulk of their time on the tasks that are most conducive to their success.
28/07/22, 20:22 - Marian EWYL21E0803: Noted
28/07/22, 20:23 - Aditi Kapoor: In my opinion time management is on you,
Time management is about being about to designate time to complete everything that you need to do, and assigning the 24 hours you have every day to the right task. If you can effectively pair up your time and the things on your to-do list, you will be able to operate at the foundational level of success. How you spend your day is up to you, whether you’re working on a project or you’re watching television all day, you’re responsible for designating your time wisely.
28/07/22, 20:31 - Marian EWYL21E0803: Yes I agree
29/07/22, 18:55 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings my proud edoofian,

01/08/22, 20:03 - Aditi Kapoor: A well-constructed timetable establishes a natural rhythm and routine, which can be comforting
 students as well as their mentors. Having a plan as a learner is very important as it helps you maximize
 and prioritize on the things that are of urgency or importance. Most students do not have an organized
 study plan and if they do, they fail to follow the plan drawn. As the Wednesday Wisdom offered advice
 on how to use our time wisely. You must share your daily schedules with ,e as part of your Saturday
 activity in a tabular format that you can check on the internet.You can draw it on paper and show it to
 me.. Do not forget to provide the scheduled time for your EWYL programme.
