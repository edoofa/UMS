21/09/23, 17:07 - Sibonokuhle EWYL23E0482: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Sibonokuhle Mhlanga and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Sibonokuhle EWYL23EO482
21/09/23, 19:31 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings Sibonokuhle!
How are you?
21/09/23, 19:32 - Saloni Rastogi: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‚Äò1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*‚Äô. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
21/09/23, 19:32 - Saloni Rastogi: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‚ÄòI am a proud edoofian‚Äô *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - ‚ÄúI am a proud Edoofian‚Äù
21/09/23, 19:32 - Saloni Rastogi: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter

3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
21/09/23, 19:32 - Saloni Rastogi: This is just a message to inform you about your sessions' days and timings:

Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *09:30-11:00 AM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
21/09/23, 19:33 - Saloni Rastogi: If you are ready then we can beginüéâ

04/10/23, 16:04 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello my Proud Edoofians,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning

05/10/23, 13:10 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Sibonokuhle!
I hope you are doing well.

Today, we're discussing the *importance of belonging to a community in our journey towards success.*

Belonging to a community, whether it's a family, a social group, or a professional network, can be incredibly motivating. It gives us a sense of purpose and a desire to contribute and be recognized. Communities provide a support system that helps us overcome obstacles, and they are rich sources of knowledge and expertise.

As we explore the significance of belongingness, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic and any project updates you might have. Please share your views and updates here.

05/10/23, 13:35 - Sibonokuhle EWYL23E0482: I learnt that Belonging to a community , whether it's a social group, a family or a professional network has benefits .These benefits include a support system that help us overcome obstacles, motivation and inspiration and access to the collective wisdom and experiences of your community members
05/10/23, 13:43 - Saloni Rastogi: Absolutely, belonging to a community is a remarkable aspect of human existence. Here's a fascinating fact: Studies have shown that being part of a community not only enhances emotional well-being but also contributes to physical health. People in strong social networks tend to have lower stress levels, reduced risk of chronic illnesses, and even longer lifespans. So, the power of community goes beyond emotional support; it extends to our overall health and longevity! üåüü§ùüè•
