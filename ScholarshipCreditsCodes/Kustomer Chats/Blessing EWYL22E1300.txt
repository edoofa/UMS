28/12/23, 15:53 - Saloni Rastogi: We'll be beginning our new journey toward this earning and learning opportunity and I want you to commence with lots of enthusiasm and willingness to work hard to achieve your dreams as you wanted to build a community and I highly think of this as a great aspiration for giving back to the society and I am sure that this EWYL journey will not only help you to earn Scholarship credits but also upskill you and make you stand out from others and I want to make sure that you excel in all aspects of this journey.

28/12/23, 16:12 - Saloni Rastogi: Blessing, since our first project si on hold right now due to internal development, may I please know how will you be working on the community building project and school project and your core understanding of each of them?
28/12/23, 16:18 - Blessing EWYL22E1300: Community building:
I shall extend social interaction to African students thus offering them an opportunity to international education (thus motivated individuals are the most appropriate)  Suitable candidates are those that have finished secondary or in final year of the secondary level. Thus l shall use various means to establishing communication between individuals and Edoofa thus there are shared documents that they shall sign and submit
28/12/23, 16:19 - Blessing EWYL22E1300: So l shall be using Whatsapp platform
28/12/23, 16:26 - Saloni Rastogi: Yes, you will be using that!
28/12/23, 16:27 - Saloni Rastogi: Can you share how will you be doing that?
28/12/23, 16:33 - Blessing EWYL22E1300: So l can either inbox candidates one by one but the most advised method is that l search for groups in common among senior secondary school individuals hence asking them to add me in then after that l also create my own group and brief everyone on the EWYL opportunity hence those interested will join the group therefore providing information to them
28/12/23, 16:34 - Blessing EWYL22E1300: Together with my mentor then they can therefore fill forms
28/12/23, 16:38 - Blessing EWYL22E1300: After we create separate groups with the candidate names , mentor and year
28/12/23, 16:51 - Saloni Rastogi: Starting from the new year, we are embarking on a new phase to enhance project performance. As the first project is currently on hold due to internal development, our attention will be dedicated to the Community Building Project and the African School Project.
We will be working diligently on these initiatives because, in just a few days, you will be only a few months behind your intake. Our primary focus will shift towards achieving a financial milestone of earning $1000-2000 before that deadline. Are you on board for this journey?
28/12/23, 16:52 - Blessing EWYL22E1300: Yes l am
