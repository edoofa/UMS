12/07/22, 17:08 - Unknown: Good Morning, Nkosikhona
I hope that you are in good health and spirits
12/07/22, 17:08 - Unknown: Let me go through your response once.
12/07/22, 17:10 - Unknown: Nkosikhona, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.
That is why I want you to make sure that you should always stay on top when it comes to EWYL Projects and be regular to submit the EWYL Lessons.
This way you will always be recognized by the Academics Board for new projects.
12/07/22, 19:02 - Nkosikhona EWYL21E0936: Good morning Mr.RANA
I am feeling good sir..
I hope that you are fine too
12/07/22, 19:02 - Nkosikhona EWYL21E0936: Thank you
12/07/22, 19:03 - Nkosikhona EWYL21E0936: Yes sir I understand. And Thank you!
12/07/22, 19:04 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

12/07/22, 19:16 - Unknown: Can you please share your Project Progress Form with me?
12/07/22, 19:27 - Nkosikhona EWYL21E0936: Okay.
For my project one, I haven't been able to find any companies but i keep on searching. 
i approached the others for my project #2 who all did not seem willing to study abroad, india to be specific, for their higher education. Well for most of the people i approached, their reason was mostly because they had managed to get admission into the local universities in my country which seemed to be much affordable, as compared to the Indian Universities.
Then for project #3 well i haven't approached any school. The reason being I was just a nit lazy and scared to do it. But that was before I got the incentive from Mr.Tosin about the importance of taking up these projects with courage and swiftly.
Then for my project #4, the Isaac project, i am almost done with it (sadly). I have managed to submit 19 videos, out of the total 20 that were demanded of in my project.
This i can say is all my project progress so far.
13/07/22, 04:53 - Unknown: Nkosikhona, Let me share the form with you.

I learnt also the lesson of allowing ourselves to be involved in our domestic businesses in our houses because we may learn quite a lot from it that will greatly aid us in our future business endeavors just as Pratice'[ involvement in his home \"Spaza\" at homs made him to learn a bit about the mining business. I also got the lesson of to always have persistence nand perseverance because in the end it all pays out greatly just as it happened with Pratice who continued with diligence and hard work through out all  his years and always strived for growth and excellence.
