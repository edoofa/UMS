06/03/23, 21:56 - Tenzin: Let us start our Today’s session with this motivational quote:
“You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think.” — A.A Milne
06/03/23, 21:58 - Tenzin: rm":"","text":"A long time ago, a baker and a farmer lived in the same small English village.

These two men had a friendly arrangement in place, where the farmer would sell a pound of butter to the baker each day.

One morning, the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he’d received the correct amount.

To his surprise, he discovered that the farmer had sold him less butter than he’d paid for.

Angry about the unfairness, he took the farmer to court.

At the hearing, the judge asked the farmer whether he used any measure to weigh the butter.

“Your honour, I am but a lowly farmer and do not own a proper measure. I simply use an old-fashioned scale,” he replied.

“How do you weight the butter then?” Enquired the judge.

To this the farmer answered:

“Your honour, long before the baker started buying butter from my farm, I’ve been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when he brings me the bread, I place it on my scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s the baker.”
06/03/23, 22:10 - Tenzin: Edoofian, Today, I will train you on how to work on our second project, the community-building project.
06/03/23, 22:12 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0128: Ok ok
06/03/23, 22:13 - Tenzin: So, now I will share specific ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
06/03/23, 22:13 - Tenzin: A] Through WhatsApp community groups:


STEP 1: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME\/(slash)MENTOR NAME\/(SLASH)DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED
For eg: a student named Tendai who formed the group on 1st February will name it-
TENDAI\/MENTOR NAME\/1FEB2023
06/03/23, 22:32 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0128: Okk
06/03/23, 22:42 - Tenzin: Before we move forward, I would want you to create this group and share the group link with me.
06/03/23, 23:17 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0128: So this group must contain people of what type
07/03/23, 18:17 - Tenzin: Greetings my proud edoofian!
I hope you are doing well.
07/03/23, 18:17 - Tenzin: For now, You just have to create the group.
I will teach you how we have to add the students in the group
07/03/23, 18:20 - Tenzin: Before, We move ahead. May I know why were you not active during our conversation yesterday?
07/03/23, 18:22 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0128: Network was tripping here
07/03/23, 18:23 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0128: Proud edofian
07/03/23, 18:24 - Tenzin: I understand that, Tafadzwa
Edoofian, It is important that we finish our conversation regarding the Community Building Project because we are lacking behind other students
07/03/23, 18:46 - Tenzin: Alright, I have noted your answer, the correct answer will be revealed shortly.","transform":"
07/03/23, 18:47 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0128: Ok ok
07/03/23, 18:48 - Tenzin: The correct answer for today's trivia was option  B","transform":"

07/03/23, 18:53 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0128: Ok
07/03/23, 18:57 - Tenzin: Great!
STEP 2: We need to find the right student (applicant) that can be a part of the group.
07/03/23, 18:57 - Tenzin: The main purpose behind forming the group is that we reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them. By following this step we make sure that before the counselling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counselling session thereafter.
07/03/23, 19:01 - Tafadzwa EWYL22E0128: Ok ok
