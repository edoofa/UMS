23/06/23, 17:48 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello Edoofian,
We hope this message finds you well in your academic pursuits. We are excited to share a Saturday activity centered around learning from influential personalities. Our chosen figure is Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of Liberia and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Through her remarkable leadership and unwavering determination, she has left an indelible mark on history. Let's draw valuable lessons from her life for our personal development.

Two traits that stand out about Ellen Johnson Sirleaf are resilience and visionary leadership. These qualities can greatly contribute to our growth and development as individuals. They can positively impact our academic pursuits, relationships, and future career goals.

To develop resilience, we can learn from Sirleaf's ability to bounce back from challenges. We can seek out difficult experiences and learn from them, cultivating a mindset of perseverance and adaptability.

Here are some suggestions to help you get started:

Identify two traits: Reflect on Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's qualities that resonate with you.

Reflect on personal development: Consider how these traits can positively impact your academic pursuits, relationships, or future career goals.

Create an action plan: Outline practical steps like seeking mentorship, practicing self-discipline, engaging in community service, or pursuing relevant courses and extracurricular activities.
Let's embark on this exciting journey together and make Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's legacy an integral part of our own lives.
Best regards,

Team Edoofa

28/06/23, 16:18 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

So this time you have to be *REGULAR IN YOUR SESSIONS*


Before we begin, let's go over what a complete session involves. 📚

▪️ First of all, you have to *come to the EWYL LINE every single day and tell me HOW PROUD ARE YOU being an Edoofian* (Including Sundays and even on days you don't have your session). This means _following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' without fail on the EWYL Line._

▪️ Secondly, It's essential to *arrive on time for the session*, as being late will not be considered as attending a session. _This brings the importance of being punctual for the session._

▪️ During our sessions, we'll cover two key topics: the *Wednesday Lesson or Weekend Activity* and *Project Updates*


To ensure your progress, I will ask for your Lessons or Activities submissions during the session. It's essential to be prepared and ready to share your work when prompted.🎓
29/06/23, 18:48 - Rachael EWYL23E0232: Noted Ma'am
29/06/23, 18:49 - Saloni Rastogi: Now, let's talk about a challenge that is included in the above-mentioned Project Update! ✈️
I have set a target for the next 21 days, which involves sharing:


*45 Community Building forms*
and
*2 School Connect forms*


To mark a session as completed, your active presence is required throughout our session time. If you encounter any network or mobile issues, I recommend addressing them beforehand so that we can make the most of our time together.

Remember, excuses won't be accepted because I believe in your determination.
29/06/23, 18:50 - Rachael EWYL23E0232: I am sorry it has been a busy week for me here at work, yesterday l failed to be available for the session l had a breakdown at work with a motorcycle and had a challenge of internet network. But l am sure starting from next session everything will work well.

+91 80023 12433
29/06/23, 18:57 - Saloni Rastogi: Coming to the point that you might have also noticed and something that brings a flavor to this challenge is Extra Curricular activity


When it comes to overall assessment and evaluation, we believe it's not just about projects and lessons. It's about how passionate you are about yourself. Therefore, there is another aspect for evaluation, which is extracurricular activities.

In the next 21 days, It's your turn to show your amazing talent and be better than all the other students in this thrilling competition. Show everyone what you can do and make them amazed by your skills.

As your mentor, I want you to tell me about what else you are good at besides academics and share your idea of how you will showcase that talent to us.

01/07/23, 14:59 - Saloni Rastogi: Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!
01/07/23, 14:59 - Saloni Rastogi: I am sharing standard information with you for the grant document shared yesterday. Make sure you have your full attention.
