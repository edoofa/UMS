How are you?
Please excuse me for not reverting back to you yesterday.
On the eve of the Independence Day of Zimbabweüáøüáº, our entire team of the EWYL Program went to visit our Indian Edoofians at our partner universities.
19/04/23, 16:05 - Saloni Rastogi: Have a look at this!
19/04/23, 16:06 - Saloni Rastogi: I am asking that what are your views on the weekend activity shared with you?
23/04/23, 11:33 - Prince EWYL22E0896: I'm a proud EDOOFIAN
23/04/23, 11:33 - Prince EWYL22E0896: Sorry my Mentor l was in a critical situation
23/04/23, 11:34 - Prince EWYL22E0896: I will go through the sessions and send the feedback
23/04/23, 11:35 - Prince EWYL22E0896: That's very good
23/04/23, 13:39 - Prince EWYL22E0896: I like reading books because reading books cab have a profound impact on personal growth and development. It expand knowledge, improve critical thinking skills, develop empathy,reduce stress, enhance creativity, build vocabulary and inspire person growth. Desire is the starting point of all achievements. The key to success is to define a goal and pour all energy, power and effort into achieving it. Holding to our desire can guarantee us success but it may take many years. To desire riches by way of an obsessive goal, a motivation plan and not accepting failure as an option. Faith is a state of mind that we must cultivate. Repeating affirmations and instructions , a state of faith is created. An impulse of thought that is continuously repeated and entered into a continuous loop of thought. The mind takes in the nature of the influence that guide it. A positive mind is more fertile to faith and faith is the starting point for all success. Lack of self-confidence can hold back success. Auto-suggestion is the bridge between conscious and the subconscious mind. We have to attach emotion on the words not just reading them aloud. When reciting affirmations laid out in the previous chapter, we must encourage our desire to consume us. Subconscious mind can only act upon thoughts that are felt. There are two types of knowledge that is general and specialized . General knowledge is of little use when attempting to accumulate wealth. Knowledge only generates money when organized and specifically directed to a definite end. Requiring specific knowledge in the area in which we intend to make fortune can lead to success. In our imagination is where all plans are created. The only limitation we face depends on how much we develop our imagination. Synthetic imagination helps us to formulate existing concepts, ideas and plans into new forms. Creative imagination is what springs forth from hunches and inspiration and new ideas are formed. Ideas are the starting point for e fortune and they are product of the imagination. To obtain our fortune, we need to collaborate with others. No individual can make it entirely on their own. To plan intelligently is the key to securing our fortune.

11/05/23, 10:24 - Prince EWYL22E0896: Belonging is an ability to connect with others, build relationships and establish sense of belonging that allows individuals to feel valued, appreciated and accepted. Belonging involves being able to navigate different social situations and environment effectively. It requires individuals to be aware of their strength and weakness, understand their values and beliefs and be open to different perspectives and experiences. To develop belonging as an ability we must seek out opportunity to connect others through joining clubs, organization or groups that share similar interests or values, volunteering in the community or participating in events and activities. Belonging as an ability also requires individuals to have a strong sense of self-awareness and self-acceptance. As students we have a vital role to play in contributing to student community. Being part of  Edoofa student community is a unique and special experience

How are you?
This weekend, the activity asked you how you can use the EWYL program to master the skill of leadership and make a plan for which projects you will prioritize to be a leader in the student community. How will you ensure that your name is on the next list of student leaders for the Edoofa student community?

In our session today:
1. We will discuss your plans
2. Project Update
24/05/23, 10:21 - Prince EWYL22E0896: Leadership is an ability of an  individual or a group of people to influence and guide members of an organization, society or team. A good is someone who can see how things can be improved and rallies people to move towards the better vision. A good leader creates an inspiring vision of the future, motivates and inspires people to engage with that vision, manages delivery of the vision and coaches a team so that it is more effective at achieving the vision. A good leader will be able to think critically about the organization and develop clear understanding of it's strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats. A good leader must be able to interact with other people in a that feels genuine. Being a good leader means being open to new ideas, possibilities and perspectives. Leadership involves the knowledge that success come with a willingness to change how things are done and to bring in fresh eyes to inspire new ideas. Leadership also means being adaptable and nimble when the situation calls for it. I believe in myself that I can be a good leader because I do have all these qualities.

05/06/23, 17:45 - Saloni Rastogi:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, Let me share a small story with you!
 Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came. 
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.
The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.

So what did the story tell: 

1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. 
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above  
05/06/23, 17:47 - Prince EWYL22E0896: 4. All of the above
05/06/23, 17:59 - Saloni Rastogi: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are well.
