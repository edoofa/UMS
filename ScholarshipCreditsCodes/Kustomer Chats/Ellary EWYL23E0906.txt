01/12/23, 14:36 - Aditi Kapoor: There were some crucial discussions we couldn't cover; I encourage your active participation and timely response because I believe you understand the significance of the EWYL session, please share your project updates and understanding of the Wednesday Lesson by the end of the day.
01/12/23, 15:06 - Ellary EWYL23E0906: morning.
i am currently taking care of my brother, he is not well hence the inconsitency
01/12/23, 15:07 - Ellary EWYL23E0906: for the projects, im working on the third one and the second one
i shared my progress of the third a while ago
01/12/23, 15:14 - Ellary EWYL23E0906: my understanding of the Wednesday lesson is that analysing will make you have a deeper understanding, be it in your academics, for example your assignments
its not just about completing them, but deeply understanding them.
So in order to understand fully it is helpful to breakdown what you might be doing into components and identify key inputs .
inputs help us to use what we already have or to acquire.
then a plan is needed in order to accomplish what you need to do.
and then comes the output, where you actually recognise your strengths and weaknesses
01/12/23, 15:14 - Ellary EWYL23E0906: i am truly sorry
i will never be late again
01/12/23, 19:56 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Ellary!
Hope you are well,

I understand.
01/12/23, 19:57 - Aditi Kapoor: That's great!
01/12/23, 19:57 - Aditi Kapoor: Your understanding of the Wednesday lesson is spot on! Analyzing tasks, especially in academics, goes beyond mere completionâ€”it's about achieving a deeper understanding. Breaking down tasks into components and identifying key inputs are essential steps. Inputs, be it information or resources, empower you to utilize what you have or acquire what's needed. Crafting a plan is crucial for effective execution. Finally, the output evaluation helps you recognize your strengths and weaknesses, contributing to continuous growth. Keep applying this analytical approach, and you'll excel in your endeavors!
01/12/23, 20:54 - Ellary EWYL23E0906: thank you

02/12/23, 16:43 - Aditi Kapoor: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

04/12/23, 17:40 - Ellary EWYL23E0906: From my EWYL projects, i have faced a lot of challenges,that include not having data or internet connection. However, i was able to quickly fix that hence now working on the first project. another challenge is that am having struggles finding students to educate on the edoofa programm.
Most of the ones am finding are not interested in pursuing their higher education due to factors like lack of funds and others.
However, i have learnt to be strong and not give up.
And not to lose hope.
The progress i have made so far is that i have managed to discuss about edoofa with 2 Schools so far. I am aiming for more.
The experience was absolutely fun and amazing, just getting to let them know about the good deeds Edoofa is doing and how higher education is made accessible.
im grateful and glad that i was welcomed well by all the schools.
i think i can improve on my projects by being resilient and not giving up.
Pushing through any obstacle i might face.
04/12/23, 19:32 - Aditi Kapoor: Greetings Ellary
Hope you are well.


Your dedication to overcoming challenges in your EWYL projects is truly commendable. Facing issues like data and internet connection limitations can be frustrating, but I'm glad to hear that you swiftly addressed and resolved those issues to continue working on your first project.
