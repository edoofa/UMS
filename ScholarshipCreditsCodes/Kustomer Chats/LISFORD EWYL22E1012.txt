15/05/23, 19:25 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am  Lisford T Machingambi and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is LISFORD EWYL22E1012
18/05/23, 15:09 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Good morning 

I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN
18/05/23, 15:09 - Ananya: `- That's right, you are a proud Edoofian!`

`- We are delighted to have you as part of our student community.``- How do you intend to broaden this student community? 

In your next session, discuss your thoughts with your mentor.
18/05/23, 15:10 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: I'm delighted too
18/05/23, 15:11 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: I'm sharing my understanding of the Wednesday wisdom below as instructed
18/05/23, 15:13 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: From the Wednesday Wisdom on servant leadership and the experiences of our founders, Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh, I have gained valuable insights. They exemplify the characteristics of servant leaders by putting the needs of others first, promoting a sense of community, and fostering personal and professional growth.

The ten characteristics of servant leaders mentioned in the lesson, such as listening, empathy, and healing, highlight the importance of understanding and supporting team members. I learned that servant leaders prioritize the well-being of their employees and create an environment where everyone feels valued.

The lesson emphasized the significance of self-awareness in leadership. By recognizing their strengths and weaknesses, leaders can better understand their impact on others and align their actions with their values. This self-reflection allows them to be more effective and empathetic leaders.

Furthermore, the lesson emphasized the visionary aspect of servant leadership, emphasizing the need for conceptualization, persuasion, and foresight. By having a clear vision and the ability to inspire and influence others, leaders can guide their teams towards success and anticipate future challenges.

Lastly, the commitment of our founders to the growth of people stood out to me. They have not only provided educational opportunities but also supported the personal and professional development of the Edoofa family. Their dedication has created a strong sense of community and empowerment.

In conclusion, from the day's lesson and the examples set by Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh, I have learned the importance of servant leadership. I am inspired to cultivate qualities such as listening, empathy, self-awareness, and a visionary mindset. I aspire to prioritize the growth and well-being of others, foster a sense of community, and lead with integrity.

Thank you for the enlightening lesson
18/05/23, 18:56 - Ananya: I appreciate you for sharing the Wednesday lesson's understanding with me, it is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.
18/05/23, 19:09 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Thank you for the emphasis on the points

22/05/23, 13:48 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: I am submitting my response for the weekend activity below
22/05/23, 13:48 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: To truly master the skill of leadership through the EWYL program and position myself as a student leader within the Edoofa community, I have devised a comprehensive plan.

First and foremost, active participation is crucial. I will eagerly engage in all assigned projects and tasks, offering my ideas and taking the initiative to ensure their success. By demonstrating my commitment to the projects, I will showcase my leadership potential.

Collaboration and networking will also play a pivotal role. I will actively seek opportunities to collaborate with fellow students, mentors, and team members. Building strong connections and fostering a supportive environment will not only enhance my leadership skills but also contribute to the growth and success of the Edoofa student community.

Furthermore, I understand the importance of taking on additional responsibilities. I will eagerly embrace opportunities to lead initiatives, organize events, and lend a helping hand to fellow students. By going above and beyond, I will prove my dedication and capability as a student leader.

Continuous learning and growth are paramount to effective leadership. I will eagerly participate in the learning opportunities provided by the EWYL program, such as webinars, workshops, and skill-building sessions. Staying up to date with industry trends and best practices will enable me to lead with knowledge and confidence.

In addition, integrity and ethics will underpin my leadership approach. I will consistently uphold high ethical standards, fostering trust and respect among my peers and mentors. By leading by example, I will inspire others to follow suit.

Effective communication is another key aspect of leadership. I will strive to enhance my communication skills, both written and verbal. By actively engaging in discussions, expressing my ideas clearly, and listening attentively to others, I will create an inclusive and collaborative environment.

Seeking mentorship and guidance from experienced leaders within the Edoofa community will further enrich my leadership journey. Learning from their valuable experiences and insights will empower me to overcome challenges and continuously refine my leadership abilities.

In conclusion, through active participation, collaboration, taking on responsibilities, continuous learning, integrity, effective communication, and seeking mentorship, I am determined to establish myself as a student leader in the Edoofa community. By implementing this comprehensive plan, I aim to positively influence and contribute to the growth and success of the student community.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CsMRiGNJp0S/
25/05/23, 17:40 - Ananya: A lovely good morning to my Proud Edoofian! 

On this Africa Day, I would like to extend my heartfelt wishes to you. As students, you are the future leaders, innovators, and change-makers who will shape Africa's destiny.🌟

On this special day, let us take a moment to reflect on the achievements and progress that Africa has made, while also acknowledging the challenges that lie ahead. Africa is a land of incredible beauty, resilience, and untapped potential. As students, you have the power to unlock that potential and make a positive impact on your communities, your countries, and the entire continent.✨
25/05/23, 17:51 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Thank you for your heartfelt wishes on Africa Day. As students, we truly appreciate the significance of this day and the responsibility we carry as future leaders, innovators, and change-makers. Africa's achievements and progress are indeed worth celebrating, and we also acknowledge the challenges that we must address.
Africa is a continent with immense beauty, resilience, and untapped potential. We understand the power we hold as students to unlock that potential and make a positive impact on our communities, countries, and the entire continent. We are committed to working hard, learning, and collaborating to shape Africa's bright future.

Once again, thank you for your kind words and encouragement. Let's continue to strive for greatness and contribute to Africa's development and prosperity.
25/05/23, 17:54 - Ananya: So, what are your plans for celebrating Africa day today?
25/05/23, 17:59 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: We have a family gathering planned for the evening where we will come together to catch up, play games, and simply enjoy each other's company, all in the spirit of Africa Day
25/05/23, 18:02 - Ananya: Wow, that is wonderful! Would you like to share some photos with me?
25/05/23, 18:13 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: I don't have a problem with sharing mine alone if any get taken, for others' not so sure as many of them value privacy so much
25/05/23, 18:15 - Ananya: Alright, no issues dear! Now may I ask if you were able to read the Wednesday lesson?
25/05/23, 18:23 - Ananya: Since you are not responding, May I know if you are facing any challenges?
25/05/23, 18:23 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: I'm sorry for the delay in response,
25/05/23, 18:24 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: I have read the Wednesday lesson
25/05/23, 18:25 - Ananya: Great, would you like to share your thoughts on it?
25/05/23, 18:27 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Sure let me do
25/05/23, 18:40 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Self-awareness is a powerful yet often overlooked skill that shapes our lives and careers. Recognized by the World Health Organization, it holds immense potential for well-being and success. Personally, I value determination, adaptability, and listening skills as my strengths. However, I face a hindrance in tolerating disrespect within teams. By cultivating self-awareness, I aim to address this challenge, developing assertiveness and conflict resolution skills. Through introspection and growth, I will unlock my true potential and make a meaningful impact in both personal and professional realms.
25/05/23, 18:40 - Ananya: I agree with the sentiment expressed in your statement about self-awareness. Our Wednesday wisdom emphasized the importance of being honest with one's feelings and taking time for self-reflection. For instance, former President Obama dedicated 4-5 hours of his time alone after dinner, which allowed him to delve deeper into self-discovery.
25/05/23, 18:52 - Ananya: Lisford,I want to emphasize the significance of this session so that you fully understand its importance. I have set aside this specific time slot exclusively for you. It is crucial that you are attentive and responsive during our discussion. Quick and timely replies are essential because if we are not able to communicate efficiently, it may hinder our progress and potentially lead to delays in completing our projects on time.
25/05/23, 18:52 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Thank you, like him I will continue trying exploring and identifying my own traits, be more self-aware and use it as an advantage both in the personal and professional realms
25/05/23, 18:54 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by my lack of attentiveness and delayed replies during our session. I understand the importance of this dedicated time and the impact it has on our progress and project timelines. Moving forward, I will ensure to be fully present, attentive, and responsive in our discussions. Your guidance and support are invaluable to me, and I appreciate your understanding.
25/05/23, 18:56 - Ananya: I feel a sense of disappointment regarding today's session, and I have certain expectations for our next session. While I understand that you may have encountered some challenges or issues, I kindly request that you make a sincere effort to be punctual in our future sessions. The next session is going to be a video session on Saturday. I will share the link shorty!
25/05/23, 18:58 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: I deeply apologize for the disappointment caused by today's session. I understand and acknowledge your expectations for our next session, and I assure you that I will make a sincere effort to be punctual and fully prepared. I appreciate your understanding and willingness to continue our mentoring journey. Thank you for sharing the details for the upcoming video session on Saturday, and I look forward to participating actively and making the most of our time together.
25/05/23, 19:27 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: I had a question about the visits of the founders,  do they also pass by South Africa or it's only Zimbabwe
25/05/23, 19:30 - Ananya: No, dear it is only Zimbabwe
25/05/23, 19:32 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Ok thank you
26/05/23, 17:46 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Greetings

29/05/23, 17:59 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Good afternoon 

I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN
29/05/23, 17:59 - Ananya: Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.
Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.

The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.
So what did the story tell: 
1. The moral of the story was that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. 
2. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.
3. The story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world.
4. All of the above
29/05/23, 18:00 - Ananya: How are you today? How was your weekend?
29/05/23, 18:01 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: I'm doing good, how are you. The weekend was great, how was yours?
29/05/23, 18:05 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Thank you for sharing the story of Andy the ant with me. I found it inspiring and meaningful. The moral of the story, as I see it, is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. Additionally, the story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world. It reminds us that if we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. I appreciate the lesson conveyed by this story, and I will keep it in mind as I continue to pursue my own goals and dreams.
29/05/23, 18:07 - Ananya: May I know if you have attended the event or you will be going to Bulawayo?
29/05/23, 18:13 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: I did not attend the event and sadly I also can't make it to Bulawayo. Due to a situation I will only be able to travel to Zimbabwe next week.
29/05/23, 18:16 - Ananya: That is alright, do not worry let me share a few insights with you.
29/05/23, 18:17 - Ananya: Our meet and greet event was an astounding success, and I am delighted to offer you an exclusive preview of the occasion. I hope you will enjoy watching this!🎉
29/05/23, 18:20 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Thank you for sharing the vedio, it's so exciting to see how big the community is
29/05/23, 18:29 - Ananya: Now, may I ask if you were able to read the Wednesday lesson and complete your weekend activity?
29/05/23, 18:31 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: 
29/05/23, 18:38 - Ananya: Great, now would you like to tell some qualities of a gold personality?
29/05/23, 18:45 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: A person with a gold personality is detail-oriented and enjoys planning ahead. They seek security and predictability, preferring structured environments and well-defined duties. They value history, tradition, and have high moral standards. Others might describe them as responsible rule-followers who believe in doing things "by the book." They enjoy being relied upon and strive to live out their values through volunteering or career choices. Gold individuals are well-suited for straightforward jobs in finance or public service
29/05/23, 18:47 - Ananya: That is great, so do you agree that you have a gold personality?
29/05/23, 18:48 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Not entirely
29/05/23, 18:48 - Ananya: Why so?
29/05/23, 18:55 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: I have some of my own traits that diverge with those of a gold personality.  I can't say I'm a straight by the book person, if I can improvise, I go for it, if it is for the better or if I see it can give a better result. At times I believe being a straight by the book person gives you restrictions and limitations and I'd I ain't that kind of person to settle for less. Also I believe myself to be a person who is flexible,  one can adapt to various work environments and I don't feel 'straight forward jobs' mentioned in the description is me. I think that's it
29/05/23, 19:00 - Ananya: I appreciate that you have a capability of self analysis, it is crucial for self growth and development. Also, yes I agree that improvising according to the situation is good and important when it comes to being diversified.
29/05/23, 19:04 - Ananya: Since, your session time is over now, we shall connect in our next session to discuss our projects.
29/05/23, 19:45 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Thank you for acknowledging the importance of self analysis and growth
01/06/23, 11:13 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Good morning

28/06/23, 21:56 - Ananya: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

We hope this message finds you well on your journey of learning and growth. We are excited to inform you that this week's Wednesday lesson is centered around a powerful concept that will shape your understanding of success.

The lesson revolves around the idea that success is not solely measured by the attainment of external goals but also by the process of becoming the person you aspire to be. It emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity to unlock your true potential and inspire others along the way.

To explore this concept further, we have prepared a PDF story for you to read. This story takes place in a fictional town called Successville and follows the transformational journey of a student named Alex. Through Alex's experiences, you will witness the power of identity-based habits and their impact on personal growth and achievement.

After reading the story, we encourage you to engage in a thoughtful discussion with your mentor. Share your learnings, insights, and reflections from the lesson. Discuss how you can apply the concept of identity-based habits in your own life to reach new heights and inspire those around you.

Remember, success is not just about the end result but also about the person you become in the process. Embrace the opportunity to grow, align your habits with your desired identity, and unleash your true potential.

Wishing you a transformative learning experience!

Team EWYL

Let us look back when Edoofa proudly joins the continent in celebrating Africa Day, a day filled with unity, pride, and the vibrant spirit of Africa!

We are honored to have such incredible Edoofians from across Africa, each one representing the rich diversity, talent, and brilliance that the continent possesses. Drop your feelings in the comments below!
29/06/23, 15:56 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: The story of Alex reminds us of the importance of identity-based habits in our journey towards success. By looking at Alex's transformation, I am inspired to reflect on my own desired identity and the qualities I want to embody.

To apply this lesson, I will start by envisioning the person I want to become and the characteristics that define that identity. I will then assess my current habits and determine whether they align with my desired identity and goals.

Setting clear goals that reflect my desired identity will be crucial. Breaking them down into manageable milestones will help me track my progress effectively.
With this clarity, I will focus on developing identity-based habits. I will establish routines and practices that support my desired identity, nurturing the qualities I aspire to have.
Throughout my journey, I will embrace challenges as opportunities for growth and learn from both successes and failures. I will also inspire and support others by sharing my experiences and insights, paying forward the knowledge I gain.

In conclusion, by taking reference from Alex's story, I am empowered to shape my own success story by aligning my habits with my desired identity and working towards becoming the best version of myself

29/06/23, 17:38 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Yes I did, I was able to
29/06/23, 17:44 - Ananya: Wonderful, I am sharing standard information with you for the grant document shared yesterday. Make sure you have your full attention.
29/06/23, 17:45 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Sure
29/06/23, 17:45 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Please do share
29/06/23, 17:45 - Ananya: In these 21 days, I want that we engage in the best possible manner to bring out fruitful results.

So this time you have to be *REGULAR IN YOUR SESSIONS*


Before we begin, let's go over what a complete session involves. 📚
29/06/23, 17:47 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Sure, do enlighten me on what a complete session involves
29/06/23, 17:48 - Ananya: ▪️ First of all, you have to *come to the EWYL LINE every single day and tell me HOW PROUD ARE YOU being an Edoofian* (Including Sundays and even on days you don't have your session). This means _following the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' without fail on the EWYL Line._

▪️ Secondly, It's essential to *arrive on time for the session*, as being late will not be considered as attending a session. _This brings the importance of being punctual for the session._

▪️ During our sessions, we'll cover two key topics: the *Wednesday Lesson or Weekend Activity* and *Project Updates*
29/06/23, 17:49 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Noted
29/06/23, 17:50 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Which session times are we using by way. 

1400hrs?
29/06/23, 17:52 - Ananya: Yes Lisford!
29/06/23, 17:54 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Ok thank you
29/06/23, 17:56 - Ananya: To ensure your progress, I will ask for your Lessons or Activities submissions during the session. It's essential to be prepared and ready to share your work when prompted.🎓
29/06/23, 17:59 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Noted, will work on that
29/06/23, 18:01 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Does that mean I should not share my understanding of the Wisdom pdf before you ask for it
29/06/23, 18:05 - Ananya: Yes, you can! I just wanted to mention that these elements should be discussed during a regular active session.
29/06/23, 18:06 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Ok, I understand, thank you for the reminder
29/06/23, 18:11 - Ananya: Now, in order to grab this amazing opportunity you have to complete a few tasks!
29/06/23, 18:16 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Sure,
29/06/23, 18:16 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Which tasks
29/06/23, 18:16 - Ananya: Let's talk about a challenge that is included in the above-mentioned Project Update! ✈️
I will set a target for you every week! So for the first week, your target is:

10 Community Building forms
and
1 School Connect form

To mark a session as completed, your active presence is required throughout our session time. If you encounter any network or mobile issues, I recommend addressing them beforehand so that we can make the most of our time together.

Remember, excuses won't be accepted because I believe in your determination.
29/06/23, 18:26 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Ok, I understand, everything noted. Will work on the target
29/06/23, 18:33 - Ananya: Coming to the point that you might have also noticed and something that brings a flavor to this challenge is Extra Curricular activity


When it comes to overall assessment and evaluation, we believe it's not just about projects and lessons. It's about how passionate you are about yourself. Therefore, there is another aspect for evaluation, which is extracurricular activities.

In the next 21 days, It's your turn to show your amazing talent and be better than all the other students in this thrilling competition. Show everyone what you can do and make them amazed by your skills.

As your mentor, I want you to tell me about what else you are good at besides academics and share your idea of how you will showcase that talent to us.
29/06/23, 18:36 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Does that include sport
29/06/23, 18:36 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: I like art 🎨,  I do pencil art
29/06/23, 18:38 - Ananya: Wow, that's fantastic! Why not create a sketch to demonstrate your talent?
29/06/23, 18:41 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Sure I can do that
29/06/23, 18:41 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Does it have to be now?
29/06/23, 18:48 - Ananya: No Lisford, it has to be done within the next 21 days!

29/06/23, 18:53 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: You have any ideas of the type of drawings I can make, those that can appeal to the audience, or something related to Edoofa I can produce
29/06/23, 18:59 - Ananya: Sure I will think about it ! If you have any more ideas, feel free to share them with me because we're determined to win this game!
29/06/23, 19:02 - Ananya: We are concluding our session for the day! Next time we shall discuss your doubts and queries about the grant document!
29/06/23, 19:03 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Ok thank you, if I get ideas of my own will do share
29/06/23, 19:03 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: Ok thank you

Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.

Reflect on the challenges you may encounter along the way. Identify any bad habits or self-limiting beliefs you need to overcome. Strategize how you'll navigate obstacles and stay focused on your desired identity. Describe the positive habits you'll cultivate to align with your ideal self. Will you establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, or embrace a growth mindset?

Paint a vivid picture of your success and the impact it has on others. Visualize how achieving your desired identity influences your life and inspires those around you. This activity is an opportunity for self-reflection, goal-setting, and envisioning a brighter future. Embrace the power of storytelling to articulate your aspirations and bring them to life.

Once you've finished, share your narrative with a friend or mentor, or simply read it aloud to celebrate the journey you're embarking on. Let this activity serve as a reminder of the incredible potential within you. Happy writing, and may your story of transformation inspire others along the way!

I also considered the challenges I may encounter along the way, including my weaknesses and self-limiting beliefs that need to be overcome.

To navigate these obstacles, I've strategized on how to stay focused and overcome my limitations. Your guidance and our previous discussions have been instrumental in identifying and addressing these self-limiting beliefs. I am determined to turn them into stepping stones for growth and success.

In terms of positive habits, I plan to establish a consistent study routine, seek out new opportunities for growth, and embrace a growth mindset. These habits will help me align with my desired identity and propel me towards my goals.

The exercise has allowed me to paint a vivid picture of my success and the impact it will have on my life and those around me. Visualizing this has inspired me to set ambitious goals and work tirelessly towards achieving them.

05/07/23, 13:49 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: From the provided lesson, I understood that exposure to a wide range of ideas and experiences enhances creative thinking by expanding the mind and stimulating the imagination. By being exposed to diverse sources of inspiration, individuals can fuel their creativity, make unique connections, and generate novel ideas. Additionally, questioning assumptions and challenging the status quo is crucial for fostering innovative thinking. This mindset encourages individuals to explore possibilities, break free from conventional thinking patterns, and find new solutions and perspectives.

I then learnt that cultivating a growth mindset involves actively seeking exposure to new ideas, perspectives, and experiences, and being willing to question assumptions and challenge the status quo. By embracing these practices, individuals can develop their creative thinking abilities and unlock new possibilities in their personal and professional pursuits
