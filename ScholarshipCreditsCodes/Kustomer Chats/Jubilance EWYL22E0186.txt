13/07/22, 19:09 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am Jubilance and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Jubilance EWYL22E0186
13/07/22, 19:17 - Unknown: Hello Jubilance!
Now all our conversations will take place on the EWYL Line only.
13/07/22, 19:18 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: Understood
14/07/22, 16:28 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: Good morning 



I am a proud EDOOFIAN
14/07/22, 16:30 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

15/07/22, 20:01 - Unknown: Hello Mederleen!
How's your day going?
15/07/22, 20:02 - Unknown: I am so happy to see your enthusiasm to follow our daily ritual.
15/07/22, 20:04 - Unknown: From his dad’s small foray into entrepreneurship, Patrice Motsepe got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe’s success story is a remarkable one showing how curiosity, doggedness, perseverance, and the knack to exploit great opportunities as they come, can determine how successful or not, any individual could become. 
And this was all about our WEDNESDAY WISDOM.
Hope you have gone through it.
I am so excited to listen to your thoughts and views here.
15/07/22, 20:21 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: My day is going well .
15/07/22, 20:21 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: Patrick Motsepe was so determined, focused and never gave up.He also had no pride thus he had to go out of  his comfort zone and ask for help inorder to get the mine shafts. He believed in himself and worked hard inorder to pay back his debts .Indeed he became a good leader and manager .
15/07/22, 22:03 - Unknown: I read your response Jubilance and I must say your thoughts shows so much dedication, commitment, and an urge to do more and more hard work.
Each day when we wake up, we see a bright sun rising and with that rising Sun comes hope and optimism in us to do much more. To summarise your understanding, I must say one thing- where there is a WILL, there is a way. Once we form our vision toward our aim, no one can stop us. There will be instances where we will fail, fall down, and lose hope but I must say that there is always a rising Sun waiting for us. With can our strength to our full capabilities and make it work to our best. Also, with the way people applauded Patrice, I am sure you realize why is it important to go good and keep working hard. You are a bright student and I know you will keep working hard with your head high and with more enthusiasm and zeal.
15/07/22, 22:05 - Unknown: I would also like you to inform that in case you miss your session on TUESDAY, we miss have a session on Wednesday.
And in case you miss your session on FRIDAY, we can have our session on Saturday.
But it is important that you inform me beforehand in case of any emergency.
15/07/22, 22:37 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: Understood,  l will inform you if there is an emergency.
15/07/22, 22:38 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: Thank you ma'am.
16/07/22, 00:56 - Unknown: Great Jubilance.
16/07/22, 00:57 - Unknown: Now jubilance along with weekly lessons and activities, we have to work on the projects also- the three that we just discussed few days back.
16/07/22, 02:44 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: Of course l still remember those
16/07/22, 04:09 - Unknown: Great to see your understanding of a our daily ritual.
16/07/22, 16:04 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: Good morning

16/07/22, 19:29 - Unknown: Greetings Jubilance!
Hope you are having an amazing day.
16/07/22, 19:31 - Unknown: I am so glad that you know who a proud edoofian is and what it denotes.
17/07/22, 04:01 - Unknown: Do you have any confusion as to who a proud edoofian is?
17/07/22, 04:02 - Unknown: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
17/07/22, 04:02 - Unknown: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
17/07/22, 04:06 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: Understood,  thank you for clearing my confusion
17/07/22, 04:25 - Unknown: I am always here Jubilance to clear your doubts.
18/07/22, 01:39 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: Good evening

19/07/22, 23:04 - Unknown: Greetings Jubilance!
How's your day going?
19/07/22, 23:20 - Unknown: I went through your response Jubilance and I must say that it made me so inquisitive about the web development industry. Zimbabwe’s combination of relatively stable governance, strategic location, and young and innovative population has made it an attractive destination for multinational companies.
19/07/22, 23:21 - Unknown: The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader. 
Also Jubilance, along with the SWOT analysis of a company, I would appreciate it if you also share a SWOT analysis of yourself. I want to see how much more you have learned beyond this activity.
20/07/22, 00:08 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: My day is going well.
20/07/22, 00:08 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: Good to hear
20/07/22, 00:10 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: Understood
20/07/22, 01:39 - Unknown: Please share a SWOT of yourself too Jubilance, that would be very much appreciated.

20/07/22, 15:52 - Unknown: Greetings of the day Jubilance!
How did your day go?
20/07/22, 15:54 - Unknown: I am so glad to see your understanding of a proud edoofian, you are a true ambassador Jubilance.
20/07/22, 16:02 - Unknown: I am so happy to see that you have recognized your weaknesses and strengths very well Jubilance. Do you know what I feel, the true trait of a leader is when they realize what are their strong and weak points. No doubt that you are a hardworking and optimistic student and I feel glad to interact with you each day. Now that you know that have a reduced network of contacts, we can work on building networking. 
1. Building relationships
The key to business, and a successful job hunt, is building strong interpersonal relationships over time with people.

Before you ask for help it is very important to offer something first. You want to be someone who is perceived to offer value, and a positive and useful connection to have.

2. Keeping in contact
With the prevalence of social media, people are used to ‘collecting’ social friends as a form of ‘networking’ and people are becoming increasingly disconnected.

Good networking skills are not gaining new contacts on LinkedIn; networking is developing relationships over time that is mutually beneficial but may be able to aid you in a job hunt or business venture either initially or in the future.
20/07/22, 16:03 - Unknown: 3. Staying positive
Most people don’t see returns straight away and then give up, but if you want to see results, you need to invest time into business networking over an extended period of time.

Developing your business networking skills is a long-term investment and not a short-term fix.

4. Improve your emailing skills
Whilst social media has become an important part of our everyday lives, nothing beats a well-written email. Emails remain the dominant method of communication in business, but there are some key points to getting your email read and acted upon.
20/07/22, 16:04 - Unknown: I hope this helps Jubilance.

22/07/22, 18:59 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: My key take ways from the Wednesday wisdom

- shouldn't blame others for our own failures 
-should be becareful how we speak to others
-get to work if you really want to achieve your goals in life 
-be positive 
-remain determined
-Accept responsibility everytime
-We should learn from our mistakes
22/07/22, 19:40 - Unknown: Good morning Jubilance!
How's your day going?
22/07/22, 21:12 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: My day is going well , how about yours
23/07/22, 01:49 - Unknown: My day is going lovely, thanks for asking
23/07/22, 01:50 - Unknown: Along with this, let's move on with our session.
Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.
And this was what our WEDNESDAY Wisdom was all about and I am here to discuss your understanding of the same with me here.
So in today's session, we will:
1. Discuss your understanding of the Wednesday wisdom
2. Progress on our three ongoing projects
23/07/22, 04:44 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: My key take ways from the Wednesday wisdom

-should be becareful how we speak to others

-be positive 
-remain determined
-Accept responsibility everytime
-We should learn from our mistakes
23/07/22, 05:27 - Unknown: I read your response Jubilance and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :
''There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artists, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
Moreover, they think doing what they do will make you successful but that is not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful which is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they do what they like to do not what those others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do and also do what they feel is correct for their business.
If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one’s goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.''

And so with your response, I could relate to it to the maximum. I am so glad that you think this way and are so optimistic and enthusiastic from within.
23/07/22, 05:38 - Jubilance EWYL22E0186: Thank you ma'am ?

It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"

25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"
