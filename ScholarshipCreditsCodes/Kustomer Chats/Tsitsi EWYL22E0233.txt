15/07/22, 02:03 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

28/07/22, 21:53 - Unknown: We are back with our Wednesday lesson.

I realised as soon as I started reading this lesson that most of my students needed to learn and grasp this. One person succeeding and one failing depends solely on how effectively they manage their time. Try to comprehend and apply the measures discussed in the lesson to your everyday life. I'll be here to help you, so that you can focus on learning how to manage your time effectively. In our following session, please explain in detail what you learned from the lesson.Also, do not forget to send *it by 12PM today.*

Happy learning
28/07/22, 22:19 - Unknown: Can you share your detailed understanding of your Wednesday lesson?
After that I will share my opinion.
28/07/22, 22:32 - Tsitsi EWYL22E0233: Ok ma'am
28/07/22, 22:40 - Tsitsi EWYL22E0233: I'm proud to say I acquired simple skills of making my time and the activities in it productive and effective. From the Priority Matrix , I have learnt to organise my day in such a way that I can't say I have done nothing with my day. From the time of waking-up up to the time I retire to bed I should organise my activities in an order of importance then urgency so that I might have a productive day. 

I will apply what's in the Priority Matrix, starting with going to school, after what I'm gonna do in an order of importance and also , I have learnt to set objectives, ,,like what I should acquire at the end of the day and how I will then manage my time for me to have to meet or fulfil my objectives.
28/07/22, 23:17 - Unknown: Many successful people have different approaches that got them to where they are today. But the one thing they have in common is that they know how to juggle high-level projects and make sure they spend the bulk of their time on the tasks that are most conducive to their success.

29/07/22, 21:47 - Unknown: n my opinion time management is on you,
Time management is about being about to designate time to complete everything that you need to do, and assigning the 24 hours you have every day to the right task. If you can effectively pair up your time and the things on your to-do list, you will be able to operate at the foundational level of success. How you spend your day is up to you, whether you’re working on a project or you’re watching television all day, you’re responsible for designating your time wisely.

05/08/22, 02:06 - Tsitsi EWYL22E0233: From the pdf,  I have acquired a few things to apply during my journey of entrepreneurship. I have gained that at certain stagies in life , you have to ride with people who support you ,and if there are none , then ride alone because the first obstacle to a person's success is the kind of people around him. 

And also, from Gilbert's point of view, it seems like a person does not have to think twice if an idea visited him. And to a greater extent, hi is proving that I'm my own motivation to reache my desired goals in life, and I have to include just myself in what I desire to do and the people who see light in what I desire to do.

I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time.

24/08/22, 18:35 - Unknown: As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.

We at Edoofa are delighted to bestow this title of an Edoofian to you!?","transform":"
