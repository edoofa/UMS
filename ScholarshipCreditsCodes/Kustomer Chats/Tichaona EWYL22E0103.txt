25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown: Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. 

So make sure you do not miss out of this practice and form a habit of sending “ I am a proud Edoofian” even on Sundays!

Happy Weekend!","transform":"

Now we will be discussing something extremely essential for both of us as a team,
I will educate you about some brilliant stuff,
10/08/22, 22:52 - Tichaona EWYL22E0103: Thank you
10/08/22, 22:52 - Tichaona EWYL22E0103: Yes please go on
10/08/22, 23:12 - Unknown: Today, if you go to New York, you will find hundreds of places where they learn chanting. People go for one hour in the evenings to chanting classes. They chant ‘Om Namah Shivaya’, which is originally an Indian Chant’. Of course, they have a different pronunciation .In China, they say, ‘Ladhe Ladhe’ .


Chanting brings us many medical, psychological and social benefits. In initial stages of chanting it may be difficult to recognise the benefits we derive from chanting. In later stages too, knowing the benefits of chanting can restore our faith after we have experienced them.
10/08/22, 23:47 - Tichaona EWYL22E0103: That's very interesting
11/08/22, 00:59 - Unknown: Now you tell me what is our CHANT that is to be sent each morning, all 7 days a week, including Sunday.. [In capital letters]
11/08/22, 01:00 - Tichaona EWYL22E0103: *I AM PROUD TO BE AN ENDOFIAN*
11/08/22, 22:06 - Unknown: Hello, our proud Edoofian, I hope you are doing well. 



I am pleased to share with you that, on account of Raksha Bandhan, We are observing an off today. 



Let me share the significance of this festival: On this day, a sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother as a symbol of her unconditional faith in him and of her prayers for his long life. In return, the brother promises to keep her happy always and protect her from all troubles. The festival celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.

Each relation in our life should be celebrated and festivals just provide the time to strengthen this bond. While team edoofa recharges its emotional batteries, We will connect in our next session scheduled, till then have a great time. Also, keep practising your ritual of saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian!”","transform":"

12/08/22, 21:50 - Unknown: Greetings edoofian So yes, did you do a quick research about Raksha Bandhan?
You know I had an amazing day yesterday. I am very excited to tell you how it all went.
First I put a red spot on my brother's forehead, it is called 'teeka'. Then we stick some rice to that spot and after that, I tied a beautiful decorative rakhi (a thread or ribbon) on this wrist.
Sisters do that for the long life of their brothers and to that, the brothers promise to protect their sisters.
Later we have delicious sweets and exchanged presents.
12/08/22, 22:09 - Tichaona EWYL22E0103: Woooow that was very interesting and fun im glad to know about the Indian   culture

16/08/22, 19:06 - Unknown: Goodmorning my proud edoofian,
How was your long weekend?
Let me educate you about the Indian independence day which was yesterday due to which we had a long weekend!
Independence Day, in India, is a national holiday celebrated annually on August 15. Independence Day marks the end of British rule in 1947 and the establishment of a free and independent Indian nation. It also marks the anniversary of the partition of the subcontinent into two countries, India and Pakistan, which occurred at midnight on August 14–15, 1947.

25/08/22, 17:46 - Unknown: The Wednesday Wisdom Lesson this week will focus on three business success stories that went from rags to riches. Additionally, social learning is a very effective method of learning. You can learn from the mistakes and accomplishments of others, so you don't have to figure everything out on your own, for instance.

Your mentors will have a thorough discussion in our forthcoming session about what you think were the factors that led to the success of the three panellists listed here after you have carefully listened to the audio file and read the PDF.

Happy learning!

Excuse me for a delayed reply, I was unavailable due to the weekend.
I hope you had a great weekend!
It is time for your session.
16/01/23, 23:48 - Unknown: How are you?
It has been a while since we connected!
17/01/23, 02:11 - Tichaona EWYL22E0103: Yes its been a while
17/01/23, 02:12 - Tichaona EWYL22E0103: I want to ask about our progress concerning the edoofa scholarship
17/01/23, 20:11 - Unknown: Hello my lovely edoofians, hope you are doing well.

I have some amazing news and an opportunity to share with you. But first, do you know, A 2018 report by WaterAid India and Menstrual Hygiene Alliance India (MHAI) states that there are 336 million menstruating women in India, out of which only 121 million use sanitary pads. Assuming that these women use eight sanitary pads for one cycle (conservatively), a simple calculation reveals that almost one billion sanitary pads are used and disposed of every year.  The primary component in all disposable sanitary napkins is plastic. This takes approximately 500-800 years to fully disintegrate after disposal. Assuming one billion DSNs are disposed of every year, handling menstrual waste becomes a mammoth task.

And the solution to this problem is Sustainable menstruation!

Wondering what it is :

* Sustainable menstruation refers to the use of alternative products during one’s menstrual cycle for the benefit of the body and the earth.
* Sustainable menstruation is being mindful of the negative effects disposable sanitary products have on our environment in an effort to reduce the plastic waste ending up in our oceans or landfills.

I would like to invite you to our webinar on Sustainable menstruation tomorrow I.e. 18th January 2023, wherein we will be joined by Dr.Aarushi Kehar Malhotra. She will be helping us understand it better and how can each one of us be the solution to this problem.

Don’t forget to join by 5:45 PM IST, the webinar will start exactly at 6:00 PM [2:30 PM: Zimbabwean time] . Don’t be late for this webinar. Come prepared with the questions that you might have!

See you tomorrow.
17/01/23, 20:11 - Unknown: I will check!
18/01/23, 16:21 - Tichaona EWYL22E0103: Thank u
19/01/23, 22:40 - Unknown: Greetings my proud edoofian,
I hope you are doing well.

Time for our Wednesday wisdom, let us dive deep into the art of asking good questions. While listening is an important skill, the art of asking questions is equally, if not more, important when it comes to learning more about your work tasks, unlocking hidden opportunities, delivering better results, and mitigating unforeseen risks. Read the PDF carefully and share your learnings with me in our upcoming session. 

Happy learning!
