It's important to follow the routine of reciting "I am a proud edoofian" on the EWYL Line every day.
Our sessions will include discussions on Wednesday Wisdom, Weekend activities, Projects, and a Newsletter.

We believe that your voices and stories deserve to be heard by both your school heads and your fellow schoolmates.
We are excited to announce a special Saturday Activity where we invite you to create two videos—one addressed to your school heads and another for your schoolmates. In these videos, we encourage you to share your personal experiences with the Edoofa program and how it has positively impacted your life.
We also want you to apply all that you have learned in our recent Wednesday lessons on being a student leader. Use this opportunity to showcase your growth and development, and inspire others with your leadership skills.
In your videos, feel free to share anecdotes, challenges you overcame, and achievements you've accomplished through the Edoofa program. Share how it has helped you gain new perspectives, enhance your academic skills, and broaden your horizons. Let your enthusiasm and gratitude shine through as you express your thoughts and emotions about this wonderful journey.
Remember, your videos have the power to inspire and motivate others who may be considering joining the Edoofa program. By sharing your authentic experiences, you can help them make informed decision and embark on a transformative educational journey.
Once you have created your videos, please submit them to your EWYL Mentors

25/07/23, 14:01 - Ananya: When making the Saturday activity video, you don't need to film your actual conversation with the headmaster. Instead, focus on recording the content you'll be presenting to them. In simple terms, create a video that explains the Edoofa program in detail and highlights the benefits that the headmaster and the school will get from it. This way, you can showcase the program effectively and make a great impression on the headmaster.
25/07/23, 14:03 - Beckham EWYL23E0266: Oohky l understand

04/08/23, 13:28 - Ananya: Absolutely! Mastering the art of adaptability is indeed crucial when traveling to a new environment and culture, especially in a diverse country like India. Embracing the local culture, being open-minded, and respecting differences are essential skills for a successful journey.
04/08/23, 13:29 - Beckham EWYL23E0266: I understand
04/08/23, 13:31 - Ananya: You know, recently we had a meeting with Angad Sir, and as a whole team, we were planning to introduce some external projects! I'm sharing this information with my students early because these external projects will be considered as valuable experience when they pursue their future dream jobs!

These projects will only be offered to students who have excelled in the EWYL journey and previous projects, as they demonstrate dedication and consistency. So, I think it's essential for us to start preparing as soon as possible. Together, we will brainstorm creative ways to maintain our positive reputation and excellent record. What are your thoughts on this?

Therefore, I want you to be proactive and consistent with your EWYL projects so that you can uphold your reputation in the EWYL department. This way, when an external project comes up, your name will immediately come to mind as a top candidate. Keep up the hard work, and you'll create more opportunities for yourself in the future!
