28/07/22, 21:44 - Brennarose EWYL22E0199: The Wednesday Wisdom lesson was very fruitful indeed
28/07/22, 21:46 - Brennarose EWYL22E0199: The Wednesday Wisdom lesson was very fruitful indeed
It taught me things i never put into consideration like the Matrix and diving my work into urgent work n important things
I now have a way to do my work efficiently and effective
28/07/22, 23:48 - Unknown: Really good to receive your work on the Wednesday wisdom. I am sure you enjoyed it and learnt how you should manage your time in order to get the best outcome right?
28/07/22, 23:50 - Brennarose EWYL22E0199: Yes sir i did
28/07/22, 23:54 - Unknown: Now first step to take positive steps in this direction is via making a schedule for yourself, Right?
28/07/22, 23:56 - Brennarose EWYL22E0199: Yes indeed sir
29/07/22, 00:18 - Unknown: Brennarose, the distinction between urgent and important is the key to prioritizing your time and your workload, whether at work, at home or when studying.
It enables you to work out what to do first, and what can be left either until later, or not done at all. For example, if you leave an urgent but unimportant task, you may find that it becomes unnecessary.
29/07/22, 00:33 - Brennarose EWYL22E0199: Well understood sir
29/07/22, 00:48 - Unknown: So how do you believe you should put in your effort in making a schedule for your work on EWYL projects ?

05/08/22, 00:11 - Unknown: Good to read your understanding of the lesson Edoofian. The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years. The price is knowing that time is working on your side even when the results don’t show it, yet.
05/08/22, 00:17 - Brennarose EWYL22E0199: Ok sir thank you
05/08/22, 01:25 - Unknown: You see, a lack of consistency keeps ordinary people from achieving extraordinary results. Excelling at the small choices that compound over time perpetually leaves you in favorable circumstances. No matter what happens in the world, you’re never in a position where you are forced into a bad decision.
