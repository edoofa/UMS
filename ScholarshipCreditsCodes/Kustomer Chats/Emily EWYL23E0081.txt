10/06/23, 15:51 - Jasmine Kaur: SATURDAY ACTIVITY

Hello My Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.
Building your network matters not just for career success but because the friendships you form along the way shape your overall sense of happiness, connection, and meaning. But how many of us actually slow down to assess our friendships and reflect on how to deepen them?
This weekâ€™s Wednesday Wisdom was also taking about fostering networks, I personally believe, life is most fulfilling as a team sport. We achieve more, and feel betterâ€”together. Itâ€™s why we rejoice at being here, now, present with one another. Our connections, and especially our friendships, are where we thrive, and how we move forward, and upward. You will help each other grow, and figure out hard choices, and feel less alone in the world, and part of something biggerâ€”as successful, and as fulfilled, as you deserve to be.
As part of your this weeks Activity, I want you to think and write about how will you work on deepening your relation, you have opted for a path towards success with Edoofa Program, have you motivated your friends to do the same? What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately developing a stronger network for yourself.
Share your response in about 200 words and we will connect soon.

Till then Happy Learning!
12/06/23, 00:09 - Emily EWYL23E0081: Well, deepening the relations that I have will be on a good effective communication and being able to have my comrades back and help whenever I can. It's just a matter of keeping trust, honesty besides my circle is always small. Hoping to excel at my education and do the best for those around me. Most have already started college but those those I found, I informed them. It's just proving a hard task since I've always had few friends so yeah. Special efforts to contribute, will just be the way I am. I mean, we are all special in our own ways and that each contributes greatly as we all have various strengths.  In the end making a good community with everyone.
