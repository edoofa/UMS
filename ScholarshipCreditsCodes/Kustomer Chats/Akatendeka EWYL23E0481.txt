I completely understand your situation. I would like to suggest you that try managing your time wisely. Solve a lot of previous year question papers, engage in group study to get your doubts cleared.

And you can actually take 5-10 minutes break wherein you can do the Saturday activity or go through the Wednesday Lesson.
04/10/23, 13:18 - Unknown: Hello Akatendeka,

Today's Wednesday lesson will focus on a topic of great importance: "Belongingness is a fundamental human need. It's the feeling of being a part of something greater than oneself."

To get the most out of this session and engage meaningfully with your mentors, please take some time to read the provided PDF carefully. This material will serve as a foundation for our discussion and activities during the upcoming session.

Understanding the significance of belongingness is not only essential for personal growth but also crucial for building strong connections within our Edoofa community. It's about recognizing that you are an integral part of something bigger, and your presence matters.

Your mentors are excited to facilitate this discussion, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on how to apply these principles in your academic and personal journey.

Looking forward to your learnings from today's lesson. We will connect soon on Saturday with a very interesting activity. Till then....

Happy Learning
